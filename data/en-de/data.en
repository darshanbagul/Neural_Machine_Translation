If you want any tickets, you' il have to go round to the front of...
Well, I suppose it' il be alright.
What the hell am I doing around here?
They walk in here and...
Let' s see.
I hope I got...
Three?
That' il be seven dollars...
.. and 50 cents.
No.
Frank?
Frank sent us.
Did you bring a horse for me?
Looks like we' re shy of one horse.
You brought two too many.
Pa!
Look!
That' s enough for now.
It' s getting late.
Come on home.
Timmy.
Maureen, look.
What you doing there?
Go inside, quick, and get washed.
And don' t touch the apple pie or the roast.
Patrick' s already left for the station.
He' s getting ready, Pa.
- Damn it, Patrick!
- Coming, Pa.
Not bad, I' d say.
Bigger, them slices.
What the hell?
We' re throwing a party, ain' t we?
But these are the same slices as usual.
Yeah, sure.
As usual.
Maureen.
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices as big as a door if you want to.
You' il have beautiful new clothes and you won' t have to work no more.
We' re going to get rich, Pa?
Who knows?
Patrick!
Wait a minute!
Clean 'em.
The train' il come in and there won' t be no one to meet your mother.
Our mother died six years ago.
Go now, or you' il really be late.
Just a minute.
How will I recognise her?
You can' t make no mistake, Patrick.
She' s young and she' s pretty and she' s a lady.
"For travelling, I' il be wearing a black dress and the same straw hat that I was wearing when we met."
I' m gonna get some fresh water from the well.
Oh, Danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are calling
And down the mountain side
The summer' s gone
And all the roses fall...
Maureen!
What are we gonna do with this one, Frank?
Now that you' ve called me by name...
- I saw some fine stock down south.
- That so?
And the prices are good.
- These your valises, ma' am?
- Yes.
- Come, Sarah.
- Bring them other two.
We' il tote 'em for you, ma' am.
Is that true?
The sawmill needs hands?
- Was yesterday.
- Why didn' t you tell your brother?
- Hiya, Gramps.
- Hiya, Bill.
We' re back again.
Come on.
Get a move on, will you?
Get the lead out of your asses, you redskin warriors.
I got a whole train to unload.
Alright, chuck down those feed sacks first.
Come on!
What' s the name of the place you wanted to go?
Sweetwater.
Brett McBain' s farm.
McBain?
Yeah, sure.
That stubborn redheaded lrishman, tilling sand for years out in the middle of nowhere.
Sweetwater!
Only a loony like him could call that stinking piece of desert Sweetwater.
Sweetwater!
A little more to the right.
Higher.
Hold it there.
Even got here with their damn rails.
They caught up with us again, eh, Lafayette?
Let' s go!
Slow down.
What' s the matter with you?
Watch out down there!
Slow down!
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.
Don' t the train stop?
What can I do for you, ma' am?
I would like some water, if it' s no trouble.
Water?
That word is poison around these parts ever since the days of the great flood.
- You mean you never wash?
- We sure do!
I' d like to use the same facilities you people do.
You sure can.
Just happen to have a full tub at the back.
You' re lucky.
Only three people have used it this morning.
Used it one at a time or all together?
I can tell you' re accustomed to fine living.
Bet you come from one of those big eastern cities.
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans!
- You' ve been there?
- No.
She runs a bar.
You know, she...
Jug.
Do you only know how to play or do you know how to shoot?
Do you know how to blow music from that?
Pick it up.
You!
You don' t know how to play.
Try this one.
Take it.
Go on.
Here.
Bravo.
Cheyenne.
We thought we' d never make it.
It' s alright.
You' re right on time.
To bury my escort.
If I' d waited for you, I' d be in jail by now.
The gun.
You interested in fashions, Harmonica?
I saw three of these dusters a short time ago.
They were waiting for a train.
Inside the dusters, there were three men.
So?
Inside the men, there were three bullets.
That' s a crazy story, Harmonica.
For two reasons.
One, nobody around these parts got the guts to wear those dusters except Cheyenne' s, man.
Two, Cheyenne' s, man, don' t get killed.
That surprise you?
Yeah.
Well, you know music.
All the way up to two.
All the way up to six, if I have to.
And maybe faster than you.
Yeah, go on.
Play, Harmonica.
Play, so you can' t bullshit.
Only, watch those false notes.
Like so?
This cousin of mine keeps writing me to come down to New Orleans.
"Come on down.
Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money. "
I don' t think I' d get along in a big city.
It' s too full of fast men and loose women.
Begging your pardon, ma' am.
Now, I' m too used to a quiet simple country life.
He' s Timmy.
Yes.
Dear God.
On the day...
On the very day of your wedding.
Poor little miss.
Mrs.
Mrs McBain.
But we all...
We thought...
I know.
It was to be a surprise today.
Brett McBain and I were married.
A month ago.
In New Orleans.
I am the resurrection and the life.
He who believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
Amen.
- Mr Bennett!
- What' s he doing here?
I found this collar on a nail by the door.
You got no way of knowing, but this is as good as a signature.
Cheyenne' s hand.
- But why?
- Don' t worry, Mrs McBain.
We' il make 'em tell us before we hang' em.
Let' s get moving.
Come on.
Let' s go back to Flagstone.
No, Sam.
You go back.
You don' t want to stay out here alone.
Why not?
This is my home.
You know, Wobbles,..... I' m kinda mad at you.
Frank wasn' t there.
He sent three friends.
I don' t know nothing, I swear.
I only arranged the meeting the way you wanted it.
I don' t know why Frank wasn' t there.
- I swear to you that I...
- Cos he was at the McBains'.
That' s not true.
Cheyenne did that job.
Everyone knows that.
We got proof.
Faking evidence.
I don' t know.
I swear.
I only arranged the meeting.
I swear.
I don' t know nothing.
Who' s there?
Did you make coffee?
Make it.
Didn' t sleep a wink.
A pack of turds dressed in black rode herd on me the whole damn night.
Yeah, but I left them in the middle of the desert.
If they' re lucky, they' il be home in three days.
I' il do it.
You fetch the coffee.
They want to hang me, the big black crows.
Idiots.
What the hell?
I' il kill anything, but never a kid.
Be like killing a priest.
A Catholic priest, that is.
Yeah, the world is full of people who hate Cheyenne.
See, I ain' t the mean bastard people make out.
Of course, if somebody had a mind to kill me,..... it fires me up.
And a fired- up Cheyenne..... ain' t a nice thing to see.
Especially for a lady.
But you' re too smart to make him mad.
So this here' s where I was supposed to do all the killing?
Don' t seem the place is worth a shit.
Now, if somebody gets dressed up to look like me,...
.. so they can hang this thing around my neck,..... I don' t like it none.
But I can understand it.
What I don' t understand is why.
Neither do l.
But I see you looked a lot for the why.
Yeah.
What if there were a whole heap of whys?
Round.
Yellow.
You know the kind.
You rap 'em on a stone,..... and they go "ding".
Maybe.
But I didn' t find them.
By the way, you know anything about a man going around playing a harmonica?
He' s somebody you' d remember.
Instead of talking, he plays.
And when he' d better play, he talks.
You know, when you' ve killed four, it' s easy to make it five.
Sure.
You' re an expert.
Ma' am, it seems to me you ain' t caught the idea.
Of course I have.
I' m here alone in the hands of a bandit who smelled money.
If you want to, you can lay me over the table and amuse yourself.
And even call in your men.
Well, no woman ever died from that.
When you' re finished, all I' il need will be a tub of boiling water, and I' il be exactly what I was before.
With just another filthy memory.
You make good coffee, at least.
Not bad.
Congratulations.
Tell me, was it necessary that you kill all of them?
I only told you to scare them.
People scare better when they' re dying.
And can you tell me what good was your stupid massacre?
Now, a Mrs McBain has turned up.
It happens in business.
Let' s say this is something I didn' t plan on.
I have no time for surprises, Frank.
You know that.
I want to see the blue of the Pacific outside that window.
I know where you got on board.
I was there, too, remember.
To remove small obstacles from the track, you said.
Well, there were a few.
But we travelled a long way, just the same.
And fast.
Even tuberculosis of the bones travels fast.
Don' t play the sick man with me, Mr Morton.
I knew you when you were just barely limping.
I watch that dry rot rise a little more every day.
Any normal man' d put a bullet in his brain.
But you, you just got a little more hasty.
Otherwise you ain' t changed any.
I' d say you' ve changed, Frank.
A lot.
You used to take care of certain things personally.
Now, you' re keeping in the background.
You' il end up giving orders.
It' s because, now, I don' t want to leave you alone too much.
You' re gonna need somebody more and more every day to stay near you.
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.
How does it feel sitting behind that desk, Frank?
It' s almost like holding a gun.
Only much more powerful.
You see, staying with you, I..... I' m beginning to think big, too.
This McBain business..... has given me ideas.
I' m sorry for you, Frank.
You' re doing your best.
You' il never succeed in becoming like me.
Why?
Because there are many things you' il never understand.
This is one of them.
You see, Frank, there are many kinds of weapons.
And the only one that can stop that is this.
Now, shall we get back to our little problem?
My weapons might look simple to you, Mr Morton, but they can still shoot holes big enough for our little problems.
Pretty soon the widow McBain won' t be a problem no more.
You wake up one morning and say, "World, I know you."
"From now on, there are no more surprises."
And then you happen to meet a man like this, who looked like a good man.
Clear eyes, strong hands.
And he wants to marry you.
Which doesn' t happen often.
And he says he' s rich, too, which doesn' t hurt.
So you think, "The hell with New Orleans."
"Now I' il say yes and go live in the country."
"I wouldn' t mind giving him half a dozen kids after all."
"Take care of a house.
Do something.
What the hell? "
Well, God rest your soul, Brett McBain.
Even if he' s going to have a job pulling you out of the devil' s grip.
Still, I swear he' d left money around someplace.
If you can find it, you' re welcome to it.
Mrs McBain goes back to civilisation.
Minus a husband and plus a great future.
You deserve better.
The last man who told me that is buried out there.
You know, Jill, you remind me of my mother.
She was the biggest whore in Alameida and the finest woman that ever lived.
Whoever my father was, for an hour or for a month,..... he must have been a happy man.
What do you want?
Cheyenne' s right.
Once you' ve killed four, it' s easy to make it five.
This isn' t the time to leave.
Give me some water.
From the well.
I like my water fresh.
When you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground.
A sound?
Like what?
Like that.
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.
Morning, Mrs McBain.
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.
Maybe you don' t remember, but yesterday at the funeral...
I remember very well.
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes.
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.
Why is everybody hounding me about this guy Frank?
I don' t know him.
I' ve never heard of him.
I got my own worries, and all I want is to be left in peace.
Tell Frank I want to negotiate with him.
Personally.
You were told not to come here for any reason.
Whatever business you have with Frank, keep it far away from here.
I thought I should come over here and tell you about it.
You never thought it wasn' t a trick?
Sure, but you know I' m mighty careful.
No one could have followed me.
That' s the first thing I learned, working for you.
To listen unseen and to watch unheard.
You should learn to live as if you didn' t exist.
You' ve known me a long time, Frank.
You know you can trust me.
Wobbles.
How can you trust a man who wears both a belt and suspenders?
The man can' t even trust his own pants.
Let' s get out of here.
The end of the line.
Yeah.
Get him on board.
Tie him up.
Wait, Frank.
I didn' t...
So, nobody followed you?
No.
You gotta believe me.
So, this is the way I can trust you.
I can explain.
I didn' t know that he...
- Get out.
- No, Frank.
Get out.
Frank, wait!
I told you to keep quiet.
Did Logan and Jim take care of the woman?
Someone took care of them.
We found them out at McBain' s place.
Stone dead.
And the woman was gone.
Your friends have a high mortality rate, Frank.
First three, then two.
So you' re the one who makes appointments.
And you' re the one who doesn' t keep 'em.
What do you want?
Who are you?
Dave Jenkins.
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.
Calder Benson.
What' s your name?
Benson' s dead, too.
You ought to know better than anyone.
You killed 'em.
Who are you?
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!
You made a mistake back on that island, Bond.
You took something that didn' t belong to you, from a friend of Mr Big' s.
That type of mistake is tough to bounce back from.
- But I' ve only just arrived.
- Today is your lucky day, Jim!
You' re going skydiving!
There' s a helluva view of the lake from 10, 000 feet.
My only regret is I won' t be there to see it.
Let' s go!
- Good morning.
You' re...
- Mrs Bell.
You' re not my instructor.
Where' s Mr Bleeker?
Indisposed.
I' il be giving the lesson.
What' s on for today?
Let' s just wing it, shall we, Mrs Bell?
You' re over- revving.
- Leroy, slow down, for Pete' s sake!
- Do what the man say!
I can' t find the brake!
Close those doors!
Holy shit!
OK, Don.
Right.
Talk to you later.
I' ve got to go and give a lesson.
Same time tomorrow, Mrs Bell?
Yes, Mr Bleeker.
Yes, sir.
I know you just can' t glue the wings back on.
Now, Mr Bleeker, I' m sure there' s no reason for name- calling.
That' s fine.
Don' t forget the double vents.
I appreciate she' s one of your best pupils.
That' s a little frantic.
I' il keep the other three.
Any such suggestion should be put in writing to Washington.
- How is Mrs Bell?
- Intensive care, but she' il pull through.
Yes, sir.
No one' s questioning your patriotism.
I' m sure you' re a veteran, sir.
Felix, find out if there' s a Fillet Of Soul restaurant in town.
We' re way ahead of you.
It' s on Docker Street.
Strutter' s watching it now.
Hell of a send- off.
This way.
- Where' s Strutter?
- He' s gotta be inside somewhere.
Two, gentlemen?
I got a nice booth over here, just against the wall.
Do you think you could find something a little closer to the stage?
- What' s wrong with a booth?
- I once had a nasty turn in a booth.
- Bourbon.
No ice, please.
- Two Sazeracs.
Where' s your sense of adventure?
This is New Orleans.
Relax!
- Yeah, right here.
- Call for you.
- Thanks.
For a minute, I thought Harry was laying down on a job.
What happened to my...
- What happened?
Listen.
Thanks for droppin 'in, baby.
Yeah, you' re one tough pig to nail down.
You' ve been picking at me like some kind of maggot.
First, you go up to Harlem and kill one of the brothers.
And that disturbed me.
And then you go and steal this valuable young lady from my good friend, Dr Kananga.
Now, old Kananga, he believes in all that card crap.
I mean, he' s mad.
I would say Kananga is your problem now.
Thank you.
In fact, if I were you, I' d... watch my step from now on.
Yeah, well, you just let me handle our business with the man.
I got my own plans for you, baby.
But first there' s one little question that he wants answers for.
Then you' d better ship me back to the island and let him ask in person.
I' m not in the habit of giving answers to lackeys.
You damn lucky you got an ear left to hear the question with.
Which is... did you mess with that?
That' s between Solitaire and myself... and Kananga.
I' il tell him when I see him.
You won' t see sunlight unless you answer!
I' d no idea you were so frightened of him.
Did you touch her?!
When I see Kananga.
Right.
Quite revealing.
Kananga: poppy grower in thousands of acres of well- camouflaged fields, protected by the voodoo threat of Baron Samedi.
Then there' s Mr Big, distributor and wholesaler through a chain of Fillet Of Soul restaurants.
Wholesale?
Sell heroin, for money?!
My apologies.
I' m sure you simply give it away.
Excellent, Mr Bond.
That' s precisely what I intend to do.
Two tons of it, to be exact.
When entering into a fiercely competitive field, one finds it advisable to give away free samples.
Man or woman, black or white.
I don' t discriminate.
Two tons of heroin with a street value well over a billion dollars nationally distributed free?
That should make a certain group of families rather angry, wouldn' t you say?
Angry?
Why, my dear Mr Bond, it' il positively drive them out of their minds.
- And subsequently out of the business.
- Quite ingenious.
A sort of junkies' welfare system.
Merely until the number of addicts in the country has doubled, shall we say?
Then I will market that acreage you blundered into the other day.
That heroin will be very expensive indeed, leaving myself and the phone company the only two going monopolies in this nation for years to come.
And here I thought it was Solitaire who did the fortune- telling.
Let' s hope for both your sakes she still can.
Asked by the gentleman concerned.
Did you touch her?
Well, it' s not the sort of question... a gentleman answers.
Well, having set the example, I don' t expect Miss Solitaire to be any less the lady.
By the way, that' s a particularly handsome watch you' re wearing, Mr Bond.
- May I see it, please?
- You' il forgive me if I don' t get up.
Butterhook!
Tee Hee.
On the first wrong answer from Miss Solitaire, you will snip the little finger of Mr Bond' s right hand.
Starting with the second wrong answer, you will proceed to the more... vital areas.
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
On the back of Mr Bond' s watch the registration number:
3- 2- 6 -
6.
Do I speak the truth?
You speak the truth.
Well,... if nothing else, at least I' ve laid your fears to rest.
My compliments on a splendid operation.
There is one thing, however, the...
Whisper.
Take him to the farm.
When do we start back?
Soon, Solitaire.
Soon.
Solitaire, why?
I treated you well.
You lacked for nothing.
I don' t understand what you...
Mr Bond' s watch, my dear.
I gave you every break possible.
You had a 50- 50 chance.
You weren' t even close.
I had no choice.
The cards!
When the time came, I myself would have given you love.
You knew that.
You knew that!
There' s only one proper way to deal with this.
And one proper time.
The tonnage order is nearly complete.
We move it out tonight.
And I mean tonight!
Mr Bond.
How much do you know about crocodiles, Bond?
I' ve... always tried to keep them at arm' s length myself.
Cute little nippers, ain' t they?
I don' t suppose those potential overnight bags are orphans.
Oh, no!
We have some moms and dads as well.
In fact, quite a few thousand.
This is the part I like best: feeding time.
I suspect, the highlight of the tour.
Some of these babies live to be 200 years old.
Look over there.
That' s an alligator.
You can always tell by its round nose.
There' s old Albert.
He' s a croc.
Got careless with him some time back, and he took my whole arm off.
Well done, Albert!
They' il eat anything.
Even each other.
Then again, sometime they can go a whole year without eating.
I was rather counting on that.
There are two ways to disable a crocodile, you know.
I... don' t suppose you' d care to share that information with me?
One way is to jam a pencil into the depression hole behind his eyes.
And the other?
The other' s twice as simple.
You just put your hand in his mouth and pull his teeth out.
Fire!
Evans, get him!
Adam, in the car!
Head him off!
Hector, move, damn it!
Bond ripped off one of our boats.
He' s headed for the lrish Bayou.
The man that gets him, stays alive!
Now move, you mothers!
Toby.
I got me a regular Ben Hur down here.
Doin '95, minimum.
- Need any help, JW?
- Hell, no!
You got a set of wheels that just won' t quit, boy!
If they' s yours, that is.
You spin around, boy.
Ten fingers on the fender.
Legs apart.
I' m sure this ain' t exactly your debut at this sort of thing.
You picked the wrong parish to haul ass through, boy.
Nobody cuts and runs on Sheriff JW Pepper.
And that' s him speakin 'that, by the bye!
What the...
JW?
Soon as you nail that offendin 'vehicle, Miss Pearsonjust called.
Seems her dog' s foamin 'all at the mouth.
She' s got him locked up in the shed and wondered ifyou' d like to come over and shoot it for her.
You tell Miss Pearson to take a flyin '...
That look like a boat stuck in the Sheriff' s car there, Eddie?
That there' s one of them new car- boats.
I hereby do commandeer this vehicle and all those persons within.
And that means you, smartass!
Unit 23 in position.
Come in, 28.
Seems like Deke Rogers done got his boat stole offthe river but got a new one in his swimming pool.
- Sheriff, get your boys offmy frequency!
- Give me that!
Now you listen to me, trooper boy!
We got a swamp full of Black Russians drivin 'boats to beat the band down here!
Relax, Sheriff.
We' ve got a roadblock waiting for them at Miller' s Bridge.
Unit 26 at Miller' s Bridge.
We' re just about all set here.
Make that secure there!
D' you hear?
OK, fellas.
Here they come!
All right, out of my way!
I' m in charge here!
You two boys, come on!
I want those two men and their boats apprehended immediately!
Yes, sir, Captain.
I understand.
But, I don' t know where we' re gonna find a boat fast enough to catch 'em.
Call my brother- in- law, Billy Bob.
He' s got the fastest boat on the whole damn river.
Billy Bob' il sure enough fix their ass!
Yeah, call Billy Bob.
There' s two boats, Billy Bob.
They' re movin 'like buttered pigs!
Don' t let me down.
I' m on my way.
- Want something, boy?
- Yes.
I' d like to borrow this boat, if I may.
Everybody on the river would like to borrow this boat.
Billy Bob, we' ve got 'em spotted.
They' re headed for Hayley' s Landing.
That' s my brother- in- law!
That' s Billy Bob!
He' il get 'em!
Billy Bob' il get 'em!
Hot damn!
If one side of the Pepper family don' t get 'em, the other side will!
Let' s go!
Iet him now speak, or else hereafter...
Headquarters to all units.
Suspects seen proceeding down by Liberty towards Highway 11.
Proceed with caution.
Would you get that chicken coop off the road?!
Did you ever think of gettin 'a driver' s licence, boy?!
Are you sure that was your brother- in- law, Sheriff?
- Felix, what are you doing here?
- We' il get to that later.
They just took off.
There' s the son of a bitch!
I got him!
What are you?
Some kind of doomsday machine, boy?
Well, we' ve got a cage strong enough to hold an animal like you here!
- Captain, enlighten the sheriff, please.
- Yes, sir.
JW, let me have a word with you.
JW, now this fella' s from London, England.
He' s an Englishman workin 'in cooperation with our boys.
- A sort of secret agent.
- Secret agent?!
On whose side?!
We busted the Fillet of Soul an hour ago.
We came up with nothing but these.
Kananga' s clear.
You should have seen the size of the guy on the boat with him.
Nine feet tall, I swear.
Big top hat, a cockamamie flute in one hand and Solitaire in the other.
The incendiary bombs are set for midnight.
Now, that gives you exactly... 30 minutes.
Watch out for sharks on the way back.
We' il see you for breakfast, Felix.
Good hunting!
You' re going to need these and the shark gun on the way back.
Seems like the party' s started.
My regards to Baron Samedi, man - right between the eyes.
Trouble!
Mr Bond!
There you are!
And Miss Solitaire as well.
Hardly unexpected, but most welcome.
Whisper!
Two more glasses for our guests!
- What shall we drink to, Mr Bond?
- How about an earthquake?
Welcome home.
Where' s our boy?
He' il be along any time now.
I checked behind a rock and his wet suit is gone.
Keep the change.
It is unfortunate your wet suit was found only minutes before the field was destroyed.
Don' t tell me you' re not insured?
The poppy is a very sturdy flower.
You have been a relatively minor nuisance, in fact.
I find it particularly fascinating.
What is it?
A shark gun, naturally.
With compressed gas pellets.
Ingenious!
Somehow I never thought of you as a poor loser.
I was hoping you would join me to drink to the future.
Miss Solitaire used to know all about the future.
Especially predicting death.
An underground monorail.
Connected to the last refuge of a scoundrel, no doubt.
The heroin leaves here, I take it, carried somewhere by that winch.
Correct again, Mr Bond.
What a quick study you are.
Let me show you exactly how it works.
Where in hell can the man be?
Relax!
He must have got tied up somewhere.
These cans hold 25 pounds each.
There are 20 cans to a shipment, packed in watertight metal containers.
It' s your show, but isn' t there a simpler way of drowning someone?
Drown, Mr Bond?
I doubt you' d get the chance to drown.
Perhaps we could try something on an even simpler vein.
On the contrary, Mr Bond,
I think you' il find those wounds quite fatal.
Whisper...
The gate.
Slowly, Whisper, slowly, slowly.
Let our diners assemble.
Look out!
Where' s Kananga?
He always did have an inflated opinion of himself.
Oh, James!
How do we get out of here?
We take the train, of course.
Thanks for everything, Felix.
See you tomorrow night at the 21 Club.
Why do you want to travel this way?
What the hell can the two of you do on the train for 16 hours?
Say goodbye to Felix, darling.
Now, the first thing to learn in playing gin rummy is never take a card from the exposed pile unless you really need it.
Gin.
James!
What are you doing?
Just testing an old adage.
"Unlucky at cards..."
- Do hurry up, James.
- Won' t be a moment, darling.
Lock the door as well on your way up, would you, James?
After all, we wouldn' t want anyone to just walk in on us, would we?
For the first time in my life, I feel like a complete woman.
The slightest touch of your hand...
I was always so afraid that a part of me would stay with the past.
But now I know there' s no chance of that any longer.
To be able to reach out and touch you...
Mr Bond.
It' s good to see you again.
Well, that wasn' t very funny!
Now what are you doing?
Just being disarming, darling.
- Black jacket?
- Yeah.
lsn' t it hot for a long leather coat?
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah.
Look at his partner.
They just came in.
Something' s getting ready to go down.
- Go and cover that guy.
- What' s going on?
Billy will make sure I behave.
Will somebody tell me what' s going on?
No bullshit this time.
Just sit tight, Billy.
Philip!
Man, what' s happening, Phil?
He said you don' t come here no more, but I said, "It' s Phil".
- Get out of here, man.
- I told you!
- Give me a kiss, baby.
- I said get outta here!
Everybody freeze!
Turn around.
Turn around!
- Phil!
- Keep your hands on the table!
What' s wrong?
What' s all the hostility?
- Get back.
- What' s all this gun, man?
You changed.
Get back or I' il blow your brains out.
Police.
Move and I' il kill you.
Don' t move!
Turn over!
Way to go, Rosewood.
You' re some cop.
You know that?
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything' s under control.
Taggart.
Would you explain why you and Rosewood were in a strip bar out of our jurisdiction while you were on duty?
Before you chastise these officers, there' s something you should know.
The only reason they were at a strip bar is because they were tailing me.
They were outside wondering what I was doing.
I was in having a good time.
I' m into those things.
These guys waited outside and the only reason they came in was because they saw two men with bulges in their jackets going in.
Well, these guys were going to commit a robbery.
They watched them, waited for them to make their move, then foiled a crime.
I did not know what was going on.
I' m freaked out.
They must have a sixth sense.
I don' t know what you teach them, but they' re not just regular cops.
They' re supercops.
The only thing missing on these guys are capes.
ls this what really happened?
No, sir.
Would someone tell me what happened?
Well...
Foley invited us to this bar.
We accepted.
- We ordered club sodas, sir.
- Right.
Foley observed the two suspects casing the establishment.
And before we knew what was going on, he' d already disarmed one of them.
Detective Foley deserves all the credit for the arrests, sir.
I would prefer you did it in Detroit.
I understand.
I' m sorry.
But before I go I want you two to know, the supercops story was working.
OK?
It was working and you guys just messed it up.
I' m trying to figure you guys out, but I haven' t yet.
But it' s cool.
Just fuck up a perfectly good lie and it' s all right.
You guys are off the case.
Foster, McCabe, your turn.
- Don' t lose him.
- Not a chance, sir.
And you two...
ln my office.
Morning, gentlemen.
Coffee and doughnuts?
- What?
- Coffee and doughnuts.
There he is.
Morning, officers.
You the second team?
We' re the first team.
We won' t fall for a banana in the tailpipe.
You won' t fall for the banana in the tailpipe?
It should be more natural, brother, like this.
"I ain' t falling for no banana in my tailpipe." It' s more natural for us.
You' ve been hanging out with this dude too long.
That' s funny to me.
- You gonna try to keep up with me?
- No problem.
- lsn' t this Victor Maitland' s house?
- Yeah, I think so.
I' ve seen enough.
You want something to drink?
I got some stuff in the trunk.
Excuse me.
For a man on vacation, you look like you' re on a stakeout.
No, no.
This is a picnic area.
I' ve been shooting the shit long enough.
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.
What the hell' s he doing?
Can you put this in a good spot?
This shit happened last time I parked here.
May I help you?
I' m looking for Victor Maitland.
You realise that this is a members only club?
I have to talk to Victor.
It' s very important.
- Victor Maitland, are you sure?
- Yes.
Grey- haired gentleman.
Very dark skin.
Capricorn.
Why don' t you give me the message and I' il take it to him?
Tell Victor that Ramon, the fella he met about a week ago...
Tell him that Ramon went to the clinic, and I found out that I have... herpes simplex 10.
I think Victor should check himself out with his physician before things start falling off on the man.
Perhaps you better tell him that.
- I think that would be best.
- So do l.
Hi, Victor.
I' m back.
Look, guys, don' t even try it.
Why don' t you get the hell out of here?
Get the fuck away from me, man.
Very good, Victor.
Could you teach him to roll over and sit, too?
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.
- Last time, I didn' t get the chance.
- I' ve nothing to say to you.
That' s cool, I' il do all the talking.
This is a very nice place, Vic.
Hi.
I like this.
This is nice.
Glad you like it.
I must make you a member.
Victor, I know that you' re into a lot of crooked shit.
And I have a pretty good idea that you had Mikey killed.
I' m going to fuck you up real bad.
ls that so?
Now listen to me, my tough little friend.
I don' t know from under what stone you crawled or where you get these ridiculous ideas about me, but it seems painfully obvious you haven' t the slightest fucking idea who you' re dealing with.
Now, my advice to you is crawl back to your little stone in Detroit before you get squashed, OK?
- Please step away from the table.
- Gotta go now, Vic.
- Nice meeting you again.
- Yeah.
Catch you later, Vic.
I can' t wait.
Don' t I know you guys?
You look so familiar.
Detective Foley, this is becoming very irritating.
Why are you bothering Victor Maitland?
I had a friend, Michael Tandino, who used to work for him.
Maitland had him killed.
When I can prove it you' il be the first to know.
Forget what you can prove, talk to me.
OK.
Everybody knows Victor Maitland is a hotshot art dealer.
Art' s not the only thing he deals.
I saw some guys in his warehouse unloading a crate of German bearer bonds.
Michael Tandino had bonds like this on him, coincidentally, when he was killed.
Just because Maitland invests in the same bonds doesn' t mean he' s a killer.
The man' s not an investor, he' s a smuggler, be it bonds, drugs or whatever.
The crate I saw didn' t even pass through customs.
Maitland is paying to get his shipments out before they' re inspected.
When his guys get it, they take the drugs or bonds out of the crates and they send it back before customs even knows what' s going on.
- And you witnessed this?
- Everything except for the drugs.
But I found coffee grounds everywhere.
- Coffee grounds?
- What does that mean?
Drugs are packed in coffee.
The scent throws off the dogs.
Very good.
Now what do we do?
Look, Detective Foley, I...
I' d really like to help you.
lf you' d found the drugs, that' s one thing, but if your only evidence is coffee, we can' t get a search warrant.
We can get around that.
We don' t "get around" search warrants.
Taggart, I want you to start checking this out.
Start with the LAPD, the FBl and the Customs Service.
Wait a minute.
Maitland is much smarter than that.
We snoop around, he' il close down and get his shipments from elsewhere.
Really? ls that what your extensive experience tells you?
I haven' t been on the force...
Shit.
- ls this the man?
- Yes, sir.
The gentleman that crashed through Victor Maitland' s window?
Who disabled an unmarked unit with a banana?
Yes, sir.
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont into a gross dereliction of duty at a striptease establishment?
It' s Rosewood, sir.
Yes, sir.
ls this the gentleman who ruined the buffet at the Harrow Club today?
Yes, sir.
I just bet you are the pride of your department in Detroit.
Lieutenant, I' d like to see you in your office.
Yes, sir.
ls this the man who wrecked the buffet at the Harrow Club today?
- Lower your voice.
- Can he hear me through the wall?
Yes, he can.
Rosewood, take Detective Foley back to his hotel room, watch him pack, and escort him to the city limits.
Then you can give him his gun back.
The two charges of disturbing the peace have been dropped against you.
But if you return to Beverly Hills, the charges will be reinstated and you will be prosecuted to the limit of the law.
- Sir, may I say something?
- What?
He seems to have enough...
You want to tell that to the chief?
- No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.
Come on, Axel.
Right.
Let me check on that tomorrow and get back to you.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Victor, hi.
- Sit down.
I' m not interrupting?
- Of course not.
There' s a gentleman in town from Detroit who says he' s a friend of Michael Tandino.
He came by the office yesterday and asked me all sorts of odd questions.
Excuse me, darling.
I believe his name is Foley.
I was wondering if you knew the fellow.
We grew up in the same neighbourhood.
Really?
Have you seen him lately?
He came in yesterday.
What?
He came by here?
And?
He told me that Mikey had been killed.
Yes.
Yes, I know.
- And then?
- That' s it.
He left and I haven' t seen him since.
Jenny, darling, do you know where he' s staying?
I have some information which might be helpful for him.
No, I have no idea.
I hope I didn' t disturb you.
- No problem.
- We' il have dinner soon, yes?
- That' d be lovely.
- Take care.
I read the manifests.
They' re expecting another shipment in today.
Bogomil...
This is a chance for me and you to blow this case wide open.
I wish I could, but I can' t.
Why?
Because Bogomil would kill me.
I' m not going to drive you to the art gallery.
It' s easy.
Jenny will let us in Maitland' s warehouse.
The shipment arrives, we nail them.
- How can you be sure it' il be drugs?
- I got a hunch.
A technique by which many crimes outside Beverly Hills get solved.
Why didn' t you tell Bogomil about this shipment?
He does everything by the book.
ls everybody in this town a robot?
This thing is very personal to me.
All he asked me to do was drive you out of town.
Now I' m going to screw that up, too.
I just fell in love with you.
Jenny, how are you?
This is my buddy Billy Rosewood.
Jenny Summers.
- Billy' s a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?
That' s Serge.
Can you get my friend an espresso?
You want it with a lemon twist?
Sure, if it' s no bother.
No, don' t be stupid.
Victor Maitland was here asking questions about you today.
He was acting real weird.
Look, I want to get back inside the warehouse.
How about I go with you?
You work in a gallery.
You' re not a cop.
lf this has to do with Mikey' s death, I want to check it out.
I don' t have time to argue with you.
Let me get my keys and we' il argue on the way.
Don' t move till I get you.
- Why can' t I come in?
- Cos you' re a cop in this town.
Without probable cause, it' s an illegal search.
Didn' t they teach you that in cop school?
- I find some evidence, I' il get you.
- You can' t...
Be cool, all right? lf anything jumps off, I' il come and get you.
ls there any chance you' il let me go in by myself?
No chance.
Fuck.
Come on.
- Seems they' ve been already.
- What are you looking for?
This.
A crate from overseas that hasn' t passed through customs yet.
What is that?
Coffee?
Yeah, it' s coffee on top.
But this ain' t sugar.
Go get Rosewood.
Welcome to the party.
It seems we have guests.
I do like surprises.
Jeannette.
I just can' t tell you how disappointed I am to find you here.
Shut up!
I don' t want to hear it.
Take her to the car and wait for me.
What are you going to do with him?
You should be more worried about what we' re going to do with you.
Don' t worry.
We' ve got cocaine and coffee, we' re going to have a party.
Thanks for having me over, Vic.
This is very nice.
Did you say something?
lf something happens to her...
I' m all ears.
I' il kill you.
Really?
That would be a neat trick.
- Well, cuz.
- Are you still pissed at me?
No.
But I should have taken care of you in Detroit.
When I popped your little buddy.
Goodbye, Mr Foley.
- Have a nice day.
- I' il try.
Damn it.
Oh, boy.
How' s that little bump on the head I gave you in Detroit?
Healed up nice, I hope.
Freeze!
Thanks.
I' il explain later.
Sergeant Taggart is here, he wants to talk to you.
Shit!
Billy, what the hell is going on?
- Sorry, Sarge, I can' t talk now.
- What do you mean?
Just check out the warehouse and please don' t say anything to Bogomil.
- He' s not transmitting any more.
- Shit.
- What' s the matter?
- Billy' s doing something dumb again.
- Was he calling from the hotel?
- No, sir.
Right now, his car' s heading north on Palm Canyon Road.
- We were there this morning.
- What?
Foley was looking over Maitland' s house.
- Do you have that warehouse address?
- Yes, sir.
Check that place out, let me know what' s going on over there.
Don' t talk to anybody but me.
Hold it, Foley.
You' re under arrest.
Billy, why are you here?
- I forced him at gunpoint.
- No, he didn' t.
Everything he said about Maitland is right.
He' s kidnapped a woman.
- Let' s get her.
- What do you think I' m doing?
- We' il have a warrant in 20 minutes.
- She could be dead in 20 minutes.
Stop.
You' re coming with us.
I' m going inside.
You want to stop me, shoot me.
Me, too.
You can do what you want, but I' m going in.
This is really serious trouble.
lf you' re lucky, you' il just get fired.
- Got it.
- This is my last warning.
I' m sorry, Sarge.
I' ve got to.
Shit.
Wait a minute.
- What' s that?
- Looks like East Gate.
Punch it up.
Who the hell is that?
Better get Maitland up here.
Where is everybody? ls Rosewood back?
- No, sir.
- Seen Taggart?
He took off about 10 minutes ago.
Foley' s on the grounds.
How the hell should I know?
Get some people out there right away.
Don' t take your eyes off that screen.
Try to locate Taggart and Rosewood.
Come on.
- They must be away from the car.
- I can see that.
Keep trying.
- DD- 1 3, come in please.
- What' s their 20?
609 Palm Canyon Road.
Who lives at that address?
A Victor Maitland, sir.
- Let' s go around.
- Come on, we can do it.
Come on.
Ready, one, two... three!
You all right?
What the fuck am I doing here?
Drop it!
- Good shot, Billy.
- Let' s go.
- Jesus Christ!
- These guys are serious.
I hate machine guns.
Cover me.
Go around front.
I' m going to check the back.
609 Palm Canyon Road.
Put out a 998, officers need assistance.
- Undercovers on scene.
- Sir?
South end units stay in their area.
Let' s go.
- Undercover officers at location.
Police!
You' re all under arrest!
Do that again, I' il shoot you myself.
Know what I keep thinking about?
Know the end of Butch Cassidy?
And the whole Bolivian army is out in front of this little hut.
I' m going to make you pay for this.
- Hanging around?
- Fuck, no.
Freeze it!
Hold it right there.
Shit!
Be careful, old boy, it might hit me.
Freeze!
Police!
You' re all under arrest!
Lay down your weapons and take two steps back with your hands up!
Very good.
Great.
What the hell' s going on here?
Shit.
- What' s this man doing here?
- Bleeding, sir.
How come he isn' t wearing cuffs?
Well, he isn' t actually in custody, sir.
Place him in custody.
Or would you like me to?
Wouldn' t you like to hear my report first, sir?
You have a report that explains all this?
Yes, sir.
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.
Miss Jeannette Summers, the manager of Mr Maitland' s art gallery, accidentally discovered what she suspected was cocaine in the gallery' s warehouse.
She immediately communicated her discovery to Detective Axel Foley.
Detective Foley was, at the time, cooperating in a joint Beverly Hills- Detroit investigation.
Detectives Foley and Rosewood proceeded to the warehouse where Rosewood discovered approximately 80 kilos of cocaine.
Rosewood called for back- up and I despatched our officers.
Sergeant Taggart was the first on the scene.
Believing a felony was in progress, Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood, with Detective Foley present only as an observer, and proceeded to enter the grounds.
ln defending ourselves, we shot several suspects, including Mr Maitland.
You expect me to believe that report?
That' s the report I' m filing, sir.
Sergeant Taggart, why don' t you tell me what happened?
Happened just like the lieutenant said, Chief.
Well, I suppose congratulations are in order.
Thank you, sir.
That report better be on my desk in the morning.
Yes, sir.
First thing.
You were lying your ass off.
Go to the hospital and get your shoulder looked at.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you do me a favour, sir?
- Your favours are all used up.
- I understand.
I just hoped you could call lnspector Todd and straighten things out for me, but that' s all right.
I' m out of a job.
It' s cool.
I think I' il stay in Beverly Hills.
I' m going to start a private investigation company.
I' il talk to Todd first thing.
- Really?
- You bet.
Thank you so much.
Hi, I' m Axel Foley checking out of suite 1035.
One moment, sir.
I' il get your bill.
Guys, you didn' t have to come to see me off, but I' m very moved.
Bogomil ordered us to make sure you got out of town.
That doesn' t matter.
What matters is that you came down here.
I' m all choked up.
I' ve got a lump in my throat.
Look a little misty yourself, Taggart.
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you.
Excuse me, the Beverly Hills Police Department is picking that up.
Get outta here.
Guys, that' s the last straw.
You guys are too nice.
Do you sell those Beverly Palm robes?
- Yes, sir. $95 apiece.
- Put them on my tab.
I have to have two of them, though.
Billy, you saved my life.
I want you to have this fine Beverly Palm robe.
Each time you get in the shower, think about our friendship.
Think about Axel Foley.
I love you, Billy.
Thanks, Axel.
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.
Billy, take care of the tab.
- Taggart...
- Here you are, sir.
This is for you.
No, that' s all right.
You keep it as a souvenir.
I already have three of them in my bag.
Thank you, sir.
Not going to say goodbye?
Aren' t you tailing me to the city limits?
- Yes, we are.
- I figured you would.
I was thinking about stopping for a drink.
- We figured you would.
- Then will you join me?
I don' t think so, Axel.
We' re still on duty.
I don' t think one beer' s going to kill us, Billy.
Right.
Listen to Taggart.
Lighten up.
One drink' s not going to kill us.
But guys, if you fall too far behind, don' t be afraid to honk, OK?
- Where we going, anyway?
- Don' t worry, just follow my lead.
I know the perfect place.
You guys' il love it.
Trust me.

LOS ANGELES 1984 1: 52a. m.
What the hell...?
Goddamn son- of- a- bitch...
What the hell...?
Hey, my turn.
Hey, what' s wrong with this picture?
Nice night for a walk?
Nice night for a walk.
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?
Right.
I think this guy' s a couple of cans short of a six- pack.
Your clothes, give them to me.
- Now.
- Fuck you, asshole.
Hey, buddy, did you just see a real bright light?
- See that guy?
- Hold it right there.
- He' s rabbiting.
I said hold it!
Go.
That son- of- a- bitch took my pants.
- What day is it?
The date.
- 1 2th May.
- Thursday.
- What year?
Let' s go.
Guard it for me, Big Buns.
Hi.
I' m late.
So am l.
- I' m in it.
- So am l.
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.
- OK.
Who gets the burly- beef?
- I ordered barbecued.
That' s mine, but I didn' t order fries.
- Mine' s the chilli beef deluxe.
- Who gets the burly- beef?
- We' re ready to order now.
- Yes, ma' am.
I' m so sorry.
This isn' t real leather, is it?
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.
Look at it this way.
ln 100 years, who' s gonna care?
The 1 2- gauge auto- loader.
That' s ltalian.
You can go pump or auto.
The 45 long slide with laser sighting.
These are new.
We just got them in.
That' s a good gun.
The beam comes on - you put the red dot where you want the bullet to go.
You can' t miss.
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40- watt range.
Hey, just what you see, pal.
The Uzi nine millimetre.
You know your weapons, buddy.
Any one of these is ideal for home defence.
So which will it be?
- All.
- I may close early today.
It' s a 1 5- day wait on the handguns, but the rifles you can take now.
- You can' t do that.
- Wrong.
Hi, baby.
Yeah, yeah, it' s me.
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.
I don' t care what you' re doing.
Come and get me.
What the...?
Hey, man, you got a serious attitude problem.
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?
I' m on my break, Chuck.
Carla' s got my station.
Sarah, come here.
It' s about you.
I mean, sort of.
lncredible.
You' re not gonna believe this.
You' re going to love this.
- What? -.. compiled from several witnesses.
Once again, Sarah Connor, 35, mother oftwo, brutally shot to death this afternoon.
You' re dead, honey.
.. if you' re into sound, for the greatest sound around, come to Bob' s Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.
We' ve got woofers, tweeters, the newest in audio and compact discs.
We' ve got graphic equalisers and sound balancers that...
Sorry.
Hello?
First I' m gonna rip the buttons off your blouse one by one, then run my tongue down your neck to your bare, gleaming breasts.
And then slowly... slowly pull yourjeans offinch by inch.
Ginger, it' s Matt.
And lick your belly in circles further and further down, and then pull your panties off with my teeth.
Who is this?
God.
Sarah?
Jesus.
I' m sorry.
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger?
Sure.
It' s the creep.
Hello?
First I' il rip the buttons off your blouse one by one...
You fucking pigs.
Wait till I get my hands on you.
Get off me.
Ed.
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.
Shot six times at less than 10 feet.
Large calibre weapon.
You know, these work.
- What' s this?
- Dead girl two.
Sent over from the Valley division this afternoon.
Are you sure there' s a point to all of this?
Look at the name, Ed.
Sarah Louise Connor. ls this right?
You' re kidding.
The press is gonna be short- stroking it.
- A one- day pattern killer.
- I hate the weird ones.
So...
Better than mortal man deserves.
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately.
Did you check messages?
I thought you did.
- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
- There you are, young man.
You mind your mother.
Hi, Sarah.
Stan Morsky.
Something' s come up.
Looks like I won' t be able to make it tonight.
Just can' t get out ofit.
I' m really sorry.
I' il make it up to you.
Call you in a day or so.
That bum.
So what if he has a Porsche?
He can' t treat you like this.
It' s Friday night, for Christ' s sake.
I' il live.
I' il break his kneecaps.
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don' t you, baby?
God.
It' s disgusting.
I' m gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.
- We will.
You, too.
- OK.
Damn it, Matt.
Shit.
These killings occurred in the order of their listings in the phone book.
- What can I tell you?
No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...
That coffee' s two hours cold.
I put a cigarette out in it.
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No.
I got her answering machine.
- I sent a unit.
There' s no answer.
- The apartment manager' s not in.
- Call her.
- I just called her.
- Call her again.
Give me a cigarette.
Hi, there.
Fooled you.
You' re talking to a machine.
But don' t be shy.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it...
Same shit.
I can hear it now.
He' s gonna be called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.
Maybe make these jackals work for us.
lf I can get on the tube by eleven o' clock, maybe she' il call us.
Well, how do I look?
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.
This just in.
Police have announced the name ofthe victim in the second oftwo murders which took place today.
lncredibly, the names ofthe two victims are virtually identical.
Two hours ago, 35- year- old Sarah Ann Connor was pronounced dead...
- Can we change this?
- Sarah Louise...
Don' t touch it.
Police are refusing to speculate on the similarity between the shooting deaths and no other connection between the two victims has been established yet.
We' il have more on this late- breaking story as it comes in.
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It' s in the back.
Hey.
Four- fifty.
You have reached the Los Angeles Police emergency number.
All lines are busy. lfyou need a police car sent out to you, stay on the line.
Go on.
I' m gonna make a belt out of you.
Don' t make me bust you up, man.
Hi, there.
Fooled you.
You' re talking to a machine.
But don' t be shy.
So talk to it and Ginger, that' s me, or Sarah will get back to you.
Wait for the beep.
This is Sarah.
Pick up ifyou' re there.
I' m at this place on Pico Boulevard called Tech Noir.
I' m really scared.
I think that there' s somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.
I need you and Matt to come and pick me up as soon as possible.
The police keep transferring me.
I' m gonna give 'em another try.
The number here is 555 9175.
Call me, kiddo.
I need your help.
It' s her.
Sarah Connor?
It' s Lieutenant Traxler.
Don' t transfer me to another department.
I won' t.
Can you tell me where you are?
- I' m in this bar called Tech Noir.
- I know it.
It' s on Pico.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don' t wanna leave.
- I think there' s a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.
You' re in a public place so you' il be safe.
Stay visible.
Don' t go outside.
- I' il have a car there in a minute.
- OK.
Hey, that guy didn' t pay.
Come with me if you wanna live.
Come on!
I got a hit- and- run felony.
Suspect vehicle - late model grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.
He' s really moving - punching lights.
I' m gonna need an ambulance at Seventh and Broadway right now.
Hold it.
Hold on.
Are you injured?
Are you shot?
Exactly.
Don' t move unless I say.
Don' t make a sound unless I say.
Do you understand?
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Please don' t hurt me.
I' m here to help you.
I' m Reese.
Sergeant Tech- Com.
DN38416.
Assigned to protect you.
You' ve been targeted for termination.
Westbound on Olympic.
Approaching Overland.
This is a mistake.
I didn' t do anything.
No, but you will.
It' s very important that you live.
This isn' t true.
How could that man just get up after you...
It' s not a man.
A machine.
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.
A machine?
Like a robot?
Not a robot.
A cyborg - cybernetic organism.
- No.
He was bleeding.
- Just a second.
Get your head down.
The Terminator' s an infiltration unit.
Part man, part machine.
Underneath it' s a hyper- alloy combat chassis.
Microprocessor controlled.
Fully armoured, very tough.
Outside it' s living human tissue.
Flesh, skin, hair, blood - grown for the cyborgs.
- Look, Reese, I don' t know...
- Pay attention.
I gotta ditch this car.
The 600- Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.
But these are new.
They look human.
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.
I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him.
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.
Not yet.
Not for about forty years.
Are you saying it' s from the future?
One possible future... from your point of view.
I don' t know tech stuff.
Then you' re from the future, too.
ls that right?
- Right.
- Right.
Cyborgs don' t feel pain.
I do.
Don' t do that again.
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.
That Terminator is out there.
It can' t be bargained with, it can' t be reasoned with.
It doesn' t feel pity or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.
Can you stop it?
I don' t know.
With these weapons, I don' t know.
All units.
Ford suspect vehicle has been found in a parking structure...
Reese, why me?
Why does it want me?
There was a nuclear war.
A few years from now, all this, this whole place, everything, it' s gone, just gone.
There were survivors.
Here, there.
Nobody even knew who started it.
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don' t understand.
Defence network computers.
New, powerful, hooked into everything, trusted to run it all.
They say it got smart - a new order of intelligence.
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.
It decided our fate in a microsecond.
Extermination.
Did you see this war?
No.
I grew up after. ln the ruins.
Starving.
Hiding from the H- Ks.
- H- Ks?
- Hunter- killers.
Patrol machines built in automated factories.
Most of us were rounded up.
Put in camps for orderly disposal.
This was burned in by laser scanner.
Some of us were kept alive.
To work.
Loading bodies.
The disposal units ran night and day.
We were that close to going out for ever.
But there was one man who taught us to fight.
To storm the wire of the camps.
To smash those metal motherfuckers into junk.
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.
His name was Connor.
John Connor.
Your son, Sarah.
Your unborn son.
Drive.
Reese!
No, Reese.
No, no, no.
They' il kill you.
You in the Cadillac, let me see your hands now.
Get out of the car.
Drop to your knees.
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.
Sarah.
Sarah, try to drink some of this.
Listen, are you sure it' s them?
I mean, maybe I should look at the bodies.
No.
They' ve been identified and there' s no doubt.
Ginger.
Kiddo.
- Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.
Tell him everything Reese told you, Sarah.
Do you feel up to that?
Yeah, I guess so.
- You' re a doctor?
- Criminal psychologist.
- ls Reese crazy?
- That' s what we' re gonna find out.
So you' re a soldier.
Fighting for whom?
With the 1 32nd under Perry.
From '21 to' 27.
That' s the year 2027?
That' s right.
Then I was assigned...
- This is fucking great. -.. under John Connor.
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defence system...
Goddamn!
Sorry... built for SAC- NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems.
I see.
And this computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy.
Killing him, in effect, before he' s even conceived.
A sort of retroactive abortion?
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.
Why didn' t the computer just kill Connor then?
Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator?
It had no choice.
Their defence grid was smashed.
We' d won.
Taking out Connor then would make no difference.
Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence.
What is it called?
The time displacement equipment?
That' s right.
The Terminator had already gone through.
Connor sent me to intercept and they blew the whole place.
Well, how are you supposed to get back?
I can' t.
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.
It' s just him and me.
It' s just him and me.
Why didn' t you bring any weapons?
Something more advanced.
Don' t you have ray guns?
- Ray guns.
- Show me a piece of future technology.
You go naked.
Something about the field generated by a living organism.
Nothing dead will go.
I didn' t build the fucking thing.
OK, OK.
But this cyborg, ifit' s metal...?
- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.
Great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.
See how clever it is?
It doesn' t require a shred of proof.
Most paranoid delusions are intricate, but this is brilliant.
- Why were the other women killed?
- Records were lost in the war.
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor' s mother.
Her full name, where she lived.
Theyjust knew the city.
The Terminator was just being systematic.
- Let' s go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.
I have answered your questions.
I have to see Sarah Connor.
- I' m afraid that' s not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?
- Who is in authority here?
- Please...
Shut up!
You still don' t get it, do you?
He' il find her.
That' s what he does.
That' s all he does.
You can' t stop him.
He' il reach down her throat and pull her fucking heart out!
- Doc.
- Let go ofme!
Sorry.
He' s crazy?
ln technical terminology, he' s a loon.
Sarah, this is what they call body armour.
Our TAC guys wear these.
It' il stop a 1 2- gauge round.
This other man must' ve been wearing one under his coat.
Feel that.
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn' t feel it.
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?
Thank you.
There' s a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.
Be at least an hour before your mother gets here.
- I can' t sleep.
- Try.
It may not look it, but that couch is very comfortable.
You' il be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.
Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I was told she' s here.
Could I see her?
No.
Can' t see her.
She' s making a statement.
Where is she?
It make take a while. lf you wanna wait, there' s a bench over there.
I' il be back.
Stay here.
Watch him.
Ed...
Sarah!
Reese.
This way.
KFLB news time.
4. 36.
Top story - the largest single law enforcement mobilisation in California history is currently underway.
Police in five counties are engaged in a massive manhunt for...
Take this.
All right.
Let' s get this off the road.
- You cold?
- Freezing.
Reese?
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.
Kyle, what' s it like when you go through time?
White light.
Pain.
- It' s like being born maybe.
- My God.
I caught one back there.
- You mean you got shot?
- It' s not bad.
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It' s OK.
Forget it.
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy?
Take this off.
Jesus.
See?
It passed right through the meat.
This is gonna make me puke.
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?
I don' t know.
Anything.
Just talk.
Tell me about my son.
He' s about my height.
He has your eyes.
What' s he like?
You trust him.
He' s got a strength.
I' d die for John Connor.
Well, at least now I know what to name him.
Don' t suppose you know who the father is so I won' t tell him to get lost?
John never said much about him.
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.
I don' t wanna know.
So was it John that sent you here?
I volunteered.
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.
Sarah Connor, who taught her son to fight, organise, prepare from when he was a kid.
When you were in hiding before the war.
You' re talking about things I haven' t done yet in the past tense.
It' s driving me crazy.
Are you sure you have the right person?
I' m sure.
Come on!
Do I look like the mother of the future?
I mean, am I tough?
Organised?
I can' t even balance my chequebook.
Look, Reese, I didn' t ask for this honour and I don' t want it.
Any of it.
Your son gave me a message to give to you.
Made me memorise it.
Thank you, Sarah, for your courage through the dark years.
I can' t help you with what you must soon face.
The future is not set.
You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.
You must survive or I will never exist.
That' s all.
It' s a good field dressing.
You like it?
It' s my first.
Get some sleep.
It' il be light soon.
Talk to me some more.
About what?
Tell me about where you' re from.
All right.
You stay down by day, but at night you can move around.
You still have to be careful because the H- Ks use infrared.
But they' re not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.
That' s when the infiltrators started to appear.
The Terminators were the newest.
The worst.
Traversing your sector in search mode.
750 metres north ofyour position.
Let' s go.
- Reese.
DN384...
- Right.
Let him in.
Terminator!
I was dreaming about dogs.
We use 'em to spot Terminators.
Your world is pretty terrifying.
Hey, buddy, you got a dead cat in there or what?
Fuck you, asshole.
God damn.
Thank you.
ls this enough?
Yeah, it' s enough.
I don' t wanna ask where you got it.
- I' m coming.
- We need a room.
- With a kitchen.
- Do you have one with a kitchen?
I am dying for a shower.
We should check your bandage, too.
Later.
I' m going out for supplies.
Keep this.
No, I can' t tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.
I need to know where to reach you.
You tell me to hide out at the cabin and you won' t tell me what' s going on?
I am worried sick here.
OK.
OK, here' s the number.
- Yes.
Go ahead.
It' s 408 555 1439.
Room nine.
- I' ve got it.
I gotta go.
I' m sorry I can' t tell you more right now.
I love you, Mom.
I love you, too, sweetheart.
- Tiki Motel.
- Give me your address there.
What have we got?
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.
What' s for dinner?
- Plastique.
- That sounds good.
What is it?
It' s a nitroglycerin base.
It' s a bit more stable.
I learned to make it when I was a kid.
Make sure there' s none on the threads.
Like this.
Screw the end cap on.
Very gently.
You must' ve had a fun childhood.
That' s good.
Six more like that and I' il get started on the fuses.
He' il find us, won' t he?
Probably.
It' il never be over, will it?
Look at me.
I' m shaking.
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.
No, I' m not.
Kyle, the women in your time, what are they like?
Good fighters.
That' s not what I meant.
Was there someone special?
Someone...?
A girl, you know.
No.
Never.
Never?
I' m sorry.
I' m so sorry.
So much pain.
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.
So you feel nothing?
John Connor gave me a picture of you once.
I didn' t know why at the time.
It was very old, torn, faded.
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.
I used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment.
I memorised every line, every curve.
I came across time for you, Sarah.
I love you.
I always have.
I shouldn' t have said that.
Think fast.
Trade places.
Faster.
Drive faster.
Kyle.
Oh, my God.
You stay here.
Let' s get outta here.
Get out.
Kyle.
Come on.
Get up.
Come on.
Help me.
Get out.
Get out.
Don' t stop.
Run.
Sarah.
Kyle.
We did it, Kyle.
We got him.
No.
Wait.
What are you doing?
Cover, so he can' t track us.
Come on.
No.
Kyle.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Leave me here.
Move it, Reese.
On your feet, soldier.
On your feet.
Move it.
Go back.
- Run, Sarah.
- No.
Run.
Run.
Come on, motherfucker.
No.
You' re terminated, fucker.
Kyle.
Seven.
November 10.
Where was l?
What' s difficult is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to.
But I guess I have a while before you' re old enough to understand these tapes.
They' re more for me at this point just so that I can get it straight.
Fill her up.
Should I tell you about your father?
Boy, that' s a tough one.
Will it effect your decision to send him here, knowing that he is your father?
lf you don' t send Kyle, you can never be.
I suppose I will tell you.
I owe him that.
Maybe it' il help if... you know that in the few hours that we had together, we loved a lifetime' s worth.
- What did he just say?
- He says you' re very beautiful.
He is ashamed to ask you for five dollars for this picture.
But if he doesn' t, his father will beat him.
Pretty good hustle, kid.
What did he just say?
He said there' s a storm coming in.
I know.
- You got a $50 bill?
- When do I get it back?
Man, give me $50!
It' s all I got.
This is part of a $50 bill like Billy' s with the hidden barcode.
The corner tore.
Happens all the time.
No, the barcode' s going up, so it comes off this corner.
lf it comes off this corner it should have ink on it.
It' s too big to be blank.
Look!
It' s Oki- Doki!
Don' t let your brother get away.
I got to load my camera.
Oki- Doki!
Nice little kid.
How you doing?
Good to see you.
- I love you, Oki- Doki!
- Oki, do the Oki Shuffle.
That' s not right!
It' s like this.
Listen, I changed the steps.
You got a problem with that?
You' re supposed to be nice, no matter what!
You little motherfucker...
Grandma!
Oki- Doki pushed me!
You take it already.
Come on, Sheldon.
You playing or what?
Who ate garlic?
When' s lunch?
I want a pastrami on rye.
See that move, Rufus Rabbit?
- Axel?
- What?
Coffee.
Would you like some coffee?
Louis, how' s it going?
- Fine, fine.
- Say hi to lrene.
- Will do.
- Louis?
Follow me.
I wouldn' t mind giving her a massage.
When DeWald took over he stuck me down here on what he calls park safety watch.
I can still access most of what' s in the mainframe.
- ls this the tunnel system?
- Yes.
Do any of these tunnels lead to somewhere only DeWald' s boys can go?
No.
All park accesses are unrestricted to park personnel.
Except for the Happy Forest.
That' s being redone.
Show me the Happy Forest.
That would be right here at the end of corridor B.
It' s right after...
It' s right after...
- How long' s it been closed?
- Too long.
I' m talking about the Happy Forest ride?
The Forest.
Yes, about a couple of weeks.
It wasn' t very popular so they' re trying some new ideas.
I think they found one.
Can I have this?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
There you go.
You know... when this thing is over...
Would you like to get together and have some dinner or something?
- That would be nice.
- Can you put that in here?
Sure.
There you go.
- We have a date.
- A date.
All right.
Can you help me with this?
There you go.
Remember, an elephant never forgets.
All right.
- Louis, how goes it?
Nice to see you.
- Say hello to lrene.
- You bet.
See you.
Everything on schedule?
I had to tweak the image a little bit, but it' s under control now.
Foley' s up there.
Get him!
Will the DeWald family please come to Tiny Town?
The DeWald family to Tiny Town.
But, honey, the Happy Forest is closed.
OK, I' il meet you at the main gate at 5: 00.
- I' m sorry.
- You' re sorry?
I' d like to speak with Agent Fulbright.
Could you patch me into his radio?
It' s an emergency.
Fulbright, Foley.
I found what you' re looking for.
I' m at Wonder World.
Get out here now!
Get me 91 1.
All cars in the vicinity of Wonder World.
Proceed there immediately.
10- 19, 10- 45, and 12- 22 in progress.
Why am I not surprised?
All right, don' t shoot!
I' il put my gun down.
I put my gun on the ground, and I' m unarmed.
Don' t shoot.
This is great.
You caught him.
He broke into a security area.
Relax.
Save that shit for new talent night at San Quentin.
- I' m on to your operation.
- My operation?
God damn it, Axel, what have you done now?
He went berserk.
He was firing a weapon in the park.
There are hundreds of children around.
- They don' t give Oscars in prison.
- Fuck you!
There' s someone here from...
Fulbright, Secret Service.
- I put you on a plane to Detroit.
- You' re gonna be glad I stayed.
I know what you' re investigating.
It' s right here.
Yeah?
And what am I investigating?
Paper, US Mint quality.
That' s what was in that truck.
You wanted to follow the truck back to LA to find his print shop.
- It' s right here in Wonder World.
- What is he raving on about?
- He' s insane!
He' s proved that.
- ln Wonder World?
This place is as high- tech as NASA and Nintendo combined.
I was in there.
That' s why they were chasing me.
My men were pursuing Mr Foley because he' s delusionary and potentially dangerous.
This room, delusionary also?
No.
There is a closed ride, which we use to...
- I' d better take a look at it.
- Maybe we' d better look at it.
Right here.
Counterfeit bills, out of this machine.
- ls this true?
- 'Fraid so, officer.
'Fraid we' ve been caught red- handed, right, Ellis?
'Fraid so.
Would you like to see them?
First quality.
Make a run, Donald.
We call them Wonder World dollars.
Redeemable for admission, rides, souvenirs.
It' s our big Christmas promotion.
We' re giving it away to elementary schools across the country.
You must be in on this.
You supply equipment, he supplies paper, right?
They changed it to this shit after I left.
- After we leave they' il put it back.
- What' s this paper?
- Ordinary rag.
- They switched it.
I am tired of these accusations, officers.
I want this man arrested for public endangerment.
Could I speak with you a moment?
God damn it, we spent a fucking year with our noses up DeWald' s ass!
We' re this close to locking this up, and you piss all over us!
Our case is blown.
You' re going back to Detroit, and if you weren' t a cop,
I' d have you doing dead time in Leavenworth for life.
Detective Flint, he' s yours.
Let' s go, Axel.
Make sure he doesn' t get on the plane.
I got a wife, three kids, a mortgage and a pension that won' t cut it.
That job at Wonder World is my retirement plan.
We' re being followed.
It' s the security guards at Wonder World.
They probably want to make sure you get on that plane.
Because of you, my future is in real fucking jeopardy.
DeWald is pissed.
Sanderson won' t think too highly of me.
Hold up!
Stop the car!
- That liquor store.
Stop!
- What?
- Oh, shit!
- Wait!
It' s all right.
I' il get him.
When I do, I' il kill him!
Axel, I left as soon as I got your call.
Are you OK?
I' m fine, but I want you to think back to the night Fry disappeared.
- Maybe you forgot something.
- No.
Why would you think that?
Because this note by itself... it just don' t make no sense.
"This is important.
Life and death. "
Why would he even send that?
Not "help, I need to talk to you," nothing.
Just this.
Oh, shit.
Fry must have found some sample paper.
He knew they' d kill him so he sent it to you.
- There' s a barcode.
- What does that mean?
It used to belong to Uncle Sam.
Now we got evidence.
We can put Sanderson and DeWald' s ass in jail.
I don' t think so.
I figured you' d call Uncle Dave here, so we followed him.
I actually was a real cop once so I know how you assholes think, which is to say, slowly.
Very slowly.
So you were carrying the evidence the whole time, Sherlock?
Here' s the real ending of the story.
Let' s see if you like it.
We heard you were loose.
You had a grudge against the park.
I feared you might try to harm our beloved Uncle Dave, so I raced over here as fast as I could to try and stop you, but alas, it was too late.
Get him all the way in the car.
Take it.
Take it.
You worried about fingerprints?
Forget it.
Look at the gun.
It' s yours.
Give me your weapon.
Throw that gun in the street!
Close the door and get over there!
Hold on, Uncle Dave.
Damn it!
Don' t you die on me, man.
I got an emergency out here.
It' s a gut shot.
Come on!
That was Uncle Dave.
- Pressure?
- 90 over 40 and dropping.
I got to get his pressure up.
Let' s go, guys.
Let' s go.
On three.
One, two, three.
Get an arterial line in him.
Any medical history?
I' ve been shot before, but it' s no big deal.
- Where' s the coffee machine?
- Down the hall.
This is an all- city alert for a suspect in the Thornton shooting.
Suspect is an African- American male...
You hear some black guy shot Uncle Dave?
- No?
- Come on, let' s get out of here.
Did you hear?
Somebody shot Dave Thornton.
- Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- ls there a TV here?
Yes, of course.
Authorities believe that Foley attacked Uncle Dave in retaliation for some personal rejection.
The much- loved Uncle Dave is undergoing surgery at this moment.
According to hospital sources, the prognosis is bleak.
How does a psycho like that live with himself?
Janice, Axel.
Get out of the park.
They' re going to kill whoever knows about Roger Fry' s note.
Janice can' t come to the phone right now.
Can I take a message?
- lf you do anything...
- It' il be your fault.
I want you at Wonder World within the hour.
Come to the main gate alone and unarmed.
- And bring the Mint paper.
- Then you let us go?
lf you don' t show up here in a half- hour, alone, unarmed and with no cops, I kill your friend.
And it wouldn' t be the first time, would it?
We have an amateur video of the incident this afternoon involving Uncle Dave' s assassin, Axel Foley.
All right, don' t shoot.
I' m putting my gun down.
I' m not armed.
Don' t shoot.
That was an amateur video shot earlier today by a tourist.
Would you please take special care of my car?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- Shit!
- Ackwell...
Serge, I need a weapon.
I don' t have any weapon.
I take all back.
- What about this?
- This is the floor model.
People been breathing on it, coughing on it...
Serge, I need a weapon now.
Donny.
Donny, Ackwell in some kind of rush, OK?
So take the Annihilator and wash it off with some cologne, and take the case and make sure it' s nice and pretty.
It' s Corinthian leather.
- Billy, Axel calling.
- Axel, listen.
Am I your friend?
I' m sure you can explain, or maybe you can' t explain, but you' ve got to turn yourself in.
- I' m going to Wonder World.
Wait for me!
Axel!
Put your arms out and hold for a pat- down.
Foley just arrived, sir.
Take him to control.
We have Foley.
Come on.
- How much do you want run?
- All of it.
- Are you OK?
- Let' s have the paper.
There' s a Porsche by the front gate.
There' s a phone inside.
When she calls, I' il give you it.
- I don' t think so.
- Then we got a stalemate.
Not quite.
Orrin...
We kill you both.
The paper don' t mean jack shit.
How you know I didn' t mail it to the Secret Service?
- He' s bluffing.
Call me.
Orrin, I know how cops think.
The note is in the car.
The keys, Foley.
Give me the fucking keys.
- Drop that fucking gun!
- Again?
Drop it!
Axel, what are you doing here?
- What happened?
- It' s the coolant safety system.
Protects the mainframe in case of fire.
- How do we get it open?
- We can' t.
Not from this side.
He' s trying to use an outside line.
Do something!
Hello, police?
Shit!
Foley' s loose in the park!
I repeat...
Foley' s loose in the park!
Get him!
Mr DeWald!
We gotta do something.
Call for help!
There' s just the modem line for the computers.
I got it!
Just let the computer dial...
That' s it.
What good would that be?
A lot of good.
We can call Flint' s pager.
Foley is in Hometown Square.
Repeat, Foley is in Hometown Square.
Foley is heading for Alien Attack.
Attention.
This is a red alert.
Aliens are invading the city.
Board the subway trains for immediate evacuation.
He ran up those stairs.
I need that right away!
Damn it.
Not again.
Excuse me.
Dispatch, this is Flint.
Trace that number that keeps calling me.
555- 4085.
It' s a computer line at the Wonder World theme park.
Call and tell them their computer' s broken.
We tried, but all the voice lines are down.
Must be that Uncle Dave shooting.
- Jesus!
Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- Some fool named Axel Foley.
Where the fuck is he?
I' il try and find Axel.
All right!
There you are.
Foley' s...
Name' s Wild Bill Rosewood.
I' m the sheriff of this town.
What the hell happened here?
Shit!
Damn it!
Turn that fucking song off!
Foley?
You all right?
- Hello, Fulbright.
- You hurt bad?
Look, Foley, I guess I owe you an apology.
You were right.
I got Sanderson handcuffed in the car.
He was in on it, right?
I found out about another partner that was in on it.
So long, Foley.
You OK?
Any chance you can explain any of this to me?
Like why the fuck am I shot?
You guys OK?
- Are you OK?
- I' m fine.
I wonder what time the park opens.
He needs medical attention.
- Does this hurt?
- Don' t touch it.
I am so happy to introduce to you our new character in Wonder World, named after a man who' s most responsible for my being here today.
Axel Fox!
I don' t think you' ve seen the Tunnel of Love ride, have you?
I didn' t know y' all had a Tunnel of Love ride in Wonder World.
There will be shortly.
ENGLlSH
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich?
I' il get drive- through.
You' re counting on the Winged Avenger to deliver you from evil...... aren' t you, my friend?
Are you going to kill me?
Maybe, maybe not.
We' re of two minds on the subject.
Are you a gambling man?
Let' s say we flip for it?
One man is born a hero, his brother a coward.
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...... holy men are martyred, and junkies grow legion.
Why?
Why, why, why, why, why?
Luck!
Blind, stupid, simple, doo- dah...... clueless luck!
The random toss...... is the only true justice.
Let' s see what justice has in store...... for you.
It' s like the touch of God.
Wait, wait, wait.
Fortune smiles.
Another day of wine and roses.
In your case, beer and pizza.
Out of here, guys!
- But you said you' d let me live!
Nothing' s better than live bait to trap a bat.
Hot entrance.
Two- Face?
Two guards are dead.
He' s holding a third hostage.
Didn' t see this one coming.
We should have.
The Second Bank of Gotham...
Second anniversary of the day I captured him.
How could he resist?
I' m Chase Meridian.
I asked her to come here to consult on the case.
Abnormal psychology, multiple personalities.
I read your work.
Insightful.
Naive, but insightful.
I' m flattered.
Not every girl makes a superhero' s night table.
Can we reason with him?
- He' s got innocent people up there.
- It won' t do any good.
- He' il slaughter them without a thought.
- Agreed.
A trauma powerful enough to create an alternate personality leaves one...
In a world where normal rules of right and wrong no longer apply.
Exactly.
Like you.
I could write a hell of a paper on a man who dresses like a flying rodent.
Bats aren' t rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Really?
I didn' t know that.
You are interesting.
And call me Chase.
By the way, do you have a first name, or do I call you Bats?
Let' s start this party with a bang!
Very punctual, even for his own funeral.
Boys!
Kill the Bat!
Blast him!
Open sesame.
It' s a trap!
Attention citizens of fair Gotham!
When we open that safe, we' il have everything we ever wanted:
Enough cash to rain down upon fair Gotham, a glorious flood of chaos.
And, of course...... you, my boy, dead!
It' s boiling acid!
For your dying pleasure, we are serving the acid that made us the men we are!
No!
- Yes!
Haul away!
Yes!
Haul away!
- Give me your hand.
- Don' t let go!
I must borrow this.
That' s my hearing aid!
Thanks.
My shoes are melting!
No more!
Hang on.
Hang on?
Get him down.
Take it easy with him.
You' il be all right.
Just stay calm.
This' il fix him!
Hang on, Batty!
Let' s see.
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Farewell forever to that...... pointy- eared night rat!
Face!
You need help.
Give it up.
Have the good taste to die!
See you!
Harvey Two- Face is still at large and extremely dangerous.
In other news today...... billionaire Bruce Wayne extended his profit- sharing program...... to the employees of the successful electronics branch of Wayne Enterprises.
Mr. Wayne.
Your inspections are a departmental highlight.
Oh, my God, it' s him.
I am a winner.
I am a winner.
Bioremediation.
Alternative fuel.
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.
Perhaps we should get to R & D as soon as possible.
Mister...?
Oh, Bruce Wayne.
No, that' s my name.
And you are?
Nygma.
Edward.
You hired me personally.
Just like I tell everyone.
We' ve never actually met, but your name was on the hiring slip.
I need that hand back.
Oh, yes, of course.
I' m sorry.
It' s just that...... you' re my idol.
Back to work.
And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Back to work.
It' s okay.
What' s on your mind?
Precisely.
What' s on all our minds?
Brain waves.
The future...... of Wayne Enterprises...... is brain waves.
I must apologize, Mr. Wayne.
- I terminated his project today.
I have it!
My invention...... beams any TV signal directly into the human brain.
By stimulating neurons, manipulating brain waves...... this device makes the audience feel like they' re inside the show.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?
Did you say "manipulating brain waves"?
Yes.
But...... someone like you would never need it.
Someone so...... intelligent, witty and...... charming.
I need a bit of additional funding for human trials.
Now, listen...... I want a full set of technical schematics on this, okay?
We' il be full partners in this, Bruce.
Look at us!
Two of a kind!
She' il set something up.
That' s not...... going to be good for me.
I need an answer now.
I think I deserve it.
I' m sorry, then the answer is no.
Tampering with people' s brain waves...... mind manipulation...... it just raises too many questions.
Sorry.
Thanks, keep up the good work.
The factory looks great.
All right, everyone!
Back to work!
We' il discuss this later!
You were supposed to understand.
I' il make you understand.
Lock.
Chair.
I saw the signal.
All is ready.
Commissioner?
He' s at home.
I sent the signal.
What' s wrong?
Last night at the bank I noticed something about Two- Face:
His coin.
It' s his Achilles' heel.
It can be exploited.
I know.
You called me for this?
The Batsignal is not a beeper.
I wish I could say that my interest in you was...... purely professional.
Are you trying to get under my cape?
A girl can' t live by psychoses alone.
It' s the car, right?
Chicks love it.
What is it about the wrong kind of man?
In grade school: guys with earrings.
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.
Now...
... black rubber.
Less to take off.
I don' t mind the work.
Pity I can' t see behind the mask.
We all wear masks.
My life' s an open book.
You read?
I don' t blend in at a family picnic.
We could give it a try.
I' il bring the wine...... you bring your scarred psyche.
Direct, aren' t you?
You like strong women.
I' ve done my homework.
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?
I haven' t had much luck with women.
Maybe you just haven' t met the right woman.
I saw the signal.
- What' s going on?
- Nothing.
False alarm.
Are you sure?
Women.
Now I' ve got it!
"Too many questions.
There' s too many questions.
I' il show you it works!
What the hell is going on here?
I told you this project is terminated!
I' m calling Security!
Caffeine will kill you!
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.
What are you doing?
Untie me!
This won' t hurt.
At least, I don' t think it will.
What are you doing?
You touch that switch and...
This?
Losing resolution.
More power!
Edward Nygma...... come on down!
You' re the next contestant on...... Brain Drain!
I' il take what' s inside thick skull number one!
What have we got for him?
Oh, Stickley, I' m having a breakthrough!
And a breakdown?
Maybe!
Nevertheless, I' m smarter.
I' m a genius.
No, several geniuses.
A gaggle, a swarm...... a flock of freaking Freuds!
Riddle me this, Fred.
What is everything to someone...... and nothing to everyone else?
Your mind, baby!
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!
"I' m sucking up your IQ
"Vacuuming your cortex
"Feeding off your brain"
What a rush!
What the hell just happened?
A very surprising side effect.
While you were mesmerized by my 3- D TV...... I utilized your neural energy to grow smarter.
Bruce Wayne was right!
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!
It is brain manipulation!
I' m reporting you to the FCC!
The human experimentation board!
The AMl!
And the police!
You are going up on charges...... to court, to jail...... and then to a mental institution for the rest of your life!
But, first and foremost, Nygma, you are fired!
Do you hear me?
Fired!
I don' t think so.
Help!
Hang on!
Babe!
You are fired!
Or should I say...... terminated?
Surf' s up, Big Kahuna!
Nice form, but rough on the landing.
He may have to settle for the Bronze.
"Questions," Mr. Wayne?
My work raises too many questions?
Why hasn' t anybody...... put you in your place?
Harvey Dent, once Gotham' s District Attorney...... was horribly scarred by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.
Dent' s left- brain damage turned him into a violent criminal...... who blamed Batman and who has vowed to destroy him.
Harvey Two- Face is extremely dangerous, repeat, extremely dangerous.
That was the Commissioner.
There' s been an accident at Wayne Enterprises.
Horrible way to die.
The surveillance cameras are down here.
We' il dredge the river, but with that current, I doubt we' il find the body.
Why?
Oh, why?
I just can' t believe it.
Two years working in the same office.
He was like my father...... my brother...... or a cousin that visits a lot.
Get a grip, Edward.
I found this in my cubicle.
You' il find the handwriting matches his, as does the sentence structure.
I couldn' t possibly continue on here.
The memories...
This is last night' s security log.
There' s Stickley.
Pretty cut and dry.
Yes, definitely suicide.
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce.
Stickley' s suicide doesn' t make sense.
I want full benefits for his family.
Suicide' s not covered by our corporate insurance policy.
I know.
Full benefits.
Gossip Gerty called 32 times.
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?
I' il let you know.
What' s this?
I don' t know.
I didn' t see anyone.
"If you look at the numbers on my face...
"... you won' t find 13 anyplace."
That' s hideous.
What does it mean?
It' s a riddle.
"Numbers on my face... 13."
One through twelve.
The answer is a clock.
Who would send you a riddle?
That, Maggie...... is the riddle.
Guess what I did today?
Wayne Manor.
See you soon.
Dr. Meridian, please.
I... guess I' m early.
I have an appointment.
I' m Bruce Wayne.
Good.
Then you can afford to buy me a new door.
I' m sorry.
You... sounded like you were in...
... you know, trouble.
I prefer healthy expressions of violence as opposed to breaking in.
So...... how can I help you?
Someone' s been sending me love letters.
One at my office and one at my home.
Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your opinion.
A clock.
Clock.
"Tear one off and scratch my head.
"What once was red is black instead."
A match.
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.
"Wacko?"
Is that a technical term?
Patient may suffer from obsession...... with potential homicidal tendencies.
So, what you' re saying is...... this guy' s a total wacko.
Exactly.
He' s obsessed with you.
His only escape may be to purge the fixation.
To kill me.
I think you understand obsession better than you let on.
You like bats?
That' s a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.
An inkblot.
People see what they want.
The question is: do you like bats?
Still playing with dolls?
She' s a Malaysian dream warden.
Some cultures believe she protects you from bad dreams.
It' s silly to you, I' m sure.
You look so sad.
Do you need one?
Me?
No.
Why would I?
You' re not exactly what you seem, are you?
What is it you really came here for?
Yikes, time' s up.
That' s usually my line.
I' d love to stay here chatting...
Would you?
I' m not so sure.
I must get you out of those clothes.
Excuse me?
And into a black dress.
Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?
Ladies and gentlemen...... boys and girls of all ages...... welcome to the greatest show on earth!
Who is this beautiful young woman you' re with?
Dr. Chase Meridian.
A doctor?
What kind of doctor?... for Gotham Children' s Hospital.
Let' s thank our largest single donor:
Bruce Wayne!
Ladies and gentlemen...... 70 feet above the ground...... performing feats of unimaginable aerial skill...... the Flying Graysons!
Would you like to join me?
I' d like to.
I love climbing.
I really love it.
But?
I' ve met someone.
That' s fast work.
You just moved here.
You could say he just...... dropped out of the sky and...... bang!
I think he felt it too.
He sure did.
What?
Who wouldn' t?
Now......
Richard...... the youngest Flying Grayson...... will perform the awe- inspiring...... death drop...... without the safety...... of a net!
Let' s go.
You' il be okay.
Ladies...... and gentlemen!
Now, the new management of the circus invites you to forget...... this good, wholesome fun...... and join us in a celebration of absolute chaos...... and true jesters!
Bring it on!
Now!
Tonight, a new act for your...... personal amazement.
We call it, "Massacre under the Big Top."
Let us direct your attention to the ring.
Inside this harmless- looking orb are two...... that' s two hundred sticks of TNT.
And in our innocent hand...... a radio detonator.
What do you want?
Want, Mr. Mayor?
One simple thing:
Batman.
Bruised, broken, bleeding...... in a word: dead!
Batman.
Who do we have before us?
Gotham' s finest...... well- to- do...... influential.
Surely one of you knows who Batman is.
Hell, odds are one of you pasty- faced twits is Batman!
You have two minutes.
Harvey!
I' m Batman!
We can stop them.
Go out on the rigging.
Be careful.
Don' t worry.
Go to work, boys!
Our kind of day.
Reach for it!
Stop it!
Oh, my God.
It' s good you took him in.
He hasn' t anyone now.
He' s filled out papers all day.
He hasn' t slept or eaten.
Welcome, Master Grayson.
I' m Alfred.
How' re you doing, Al?
There' s a room prepared for you.
But perhaps you' d like to eat first.
Okay, I' m out of here.
Excuse me?
Telling that cop I' d stay here...... saved me a lot of social- service interviews.
See you.
Take it easy.
Where will you go?
The circus must be halfway to Metropolis.
Get a fix on Two- Face.
Then I' il kill him.
Killing Two- Face won' t take the pain away.
It' il make it worse.
Spare me the sermons, all right?
I don' t need your advice or your charity.
Nice bike.
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?
You' re almost on empty.
Fill it up in the garage.
There' s no gas station for miles.
The pump' s over here.
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?
That' s a 1917 Harley.
Yep.
Indian Classic, fully restored.
This is a Vincent Black Knight.
They only made a hundred.
A hundred and one, actually.
She' s my favorite.
You' ve got two.
That one doesn' t run.
The throttle sticks on this one.
Alfred' s a good mechanic, but...... these need a lot of work.
If someone were to fix them up...... they could keep one.
Anyway...... have a nice trip.
You' il land on your feet.
Is the young master leaving?
Pity.
I' il just toss this away then.
Perhaps the dogs are hungry.
Hey, Al, wait up.
Just like my parents.
It' s happening again.
A monster comes out of the night, a scream, two shots.
I killed them.
What did you say?
He killed them.
Two- Face.
He slaughtered that boy' s parents.
No, no.
You said, "I killed them."
Take care of the kid.
Certainly, sir.
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?
No.
Thanks, I won' t be staying long.
Is this a robin?
My brother' s wire broke once and I swung out and grabbed him.
My father said I was his hero.
I flew in like a robin.
Some hero I turned out to be.
But your father was right.
You are a hero.
I can tell.
Throw this away, will you?
I won' t need it anymore.
I think I' il just put it in here.
Broken wings mend in time.
One day Robin will fly again.
I promise.
We' il drive.
The Puzzler?
The Gamester?
Captain Kill?
Question Mark Man?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
The Bat' s stubborn refusal to expire...... is driving us insane!
Don' t worry, baby.
You' il kill him soon.
Besides...... I made your favorite:
Sparkling champagne and...... yummy poached salmon with little quail eggs and...... a creamy...... dreamy...... lemon soufflé.
No, I made your favorite:
A charred heart of black boar...... a side of raw donkey meat...... and a Sterno and grain alcohol, straight up, baby!
Perfect!
Ladies, you spoil us!
We' re of two minds about what to eat first.
What?
I hope you made extra.
Who the hell are you?
Just a friend.
But you can call me...... The Riddler.
I' il call you dead, is more like it!
How did you find us?
But then if I talked, what would keep you from slaying me, O Segregated One?
That' s never going to heal if you don' t stop picking.
Let' s see if you bleed green.
It' s not me you want to kill.
That' s just too easy for someone as powerful as you and...... you.
But Batman...... there' s a challenge.
Kill the Bat!
Sounds like a good idea.
But have you thought it through?
A few bullets, a splash of blood, then what?
Wet hands.
Post- homicidal depression.
Why not humiliate him first?
Yeah.
Expose his frailties.
Then, when he is at his weakest...... crush him!
I see that...... sparkle in your left eye.
I can help you get Batman.
That is, if you' Il...... spare my life for just a few moments.
Thank you.
I love what you' ve done with this place.
Heavy Metal meets House and Garden.
Beautiful.
It' s so dark and Gothic and...... disgustingly decadent.
Yet so bright and chipper and...... conservative.
It' s so you!
And yet, so you!
Very few people are both a summer and a winter, but...... but you pull it off nicely.
What' s the point?
Has anyone ever told you, you have a serious impulse- control problem?
This is the point.
This is how I found you.
Let me demonstrate.
This is your brain on The Box.
This is my brain on The Box.
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?
I' il have more.
There' s more.
But only the first one' s free.
Here' s the bargain:
You' il help me steal production capital...... so I can put a Box on every TV in town...... and become Gotham' s cleverest, carbon- based life form!
And in return...
Is everybody paying attention?
I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all.
The mother of all riddles:
Who is...... Batman?
You broke into our hideout.
You violated the sanctity of our lair.
We should crush your bones into powder.
But you pose an interesting proposition.
Therefore, heads: we accept, and tails: we blow your damn head off.
Here' s a good one.
No, no, no!
There is a good one.
I' il attend to it.
- I' m not used to being waited on.
Don' t shoot me!
Don' t eyeball me!
Give me that!
Two- Face, show me how to punch a guy!
It' s dead simple, my boy.
Ball up your fist, reach back...... and assert yourself.
That looks fun.
Let me try.
Ball up the fist, reach way back... assert yourself.
One hundred thousand, two hundred and twenty.
One hundred and...
I lost count!
Last night another robbery, perpetrated by the Green- Suited Menace...... resulting in millions in diamonds stolen, with no sign of Batman.
Teamed with Two- Face, this new criminal' s pattern...... of marking his crimes with puzzles has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.
Apparently, you and Batman have a common enemy.
That was with the morning mail.
"The eight of us go forth, not back.
"To protect our king from the foe' s attack."
Chess pawns.
Clock.
Matches.
All physical, man- made objects.
Small in size, light in weight.
What' s the connection?
With all due respect, that' s why they call him The Riddler.
May I help you?
Why is this the only locked door?
What' s back there?
Master Wayne' s dead wives.
The silver closet.
On your way.
Now, you can be part of the action!
Nygma Tech brings the joy of 3- D entertainment into your home!
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you...... my vision.
The Box in every home in America...... and one day, the world!
In local news, Edward Nygma' s 3- D Box...... has become the rage of Gotham.
Rioting occurred last night at electronic stores that were sold out.
There is hardly a home without the Nygma Tech Box.
Critics claim The Box turns Gothamites into zombies.
But Edward Nygma just shrugs.
"That' s what they said when TV was invented."
Master Dick!
Up here.
Just checking, young sir.
Intruder alert.
Intruder alert.
I have something for you.
It' s on the table.
I hope you like it.
Call it clinical intuition.
I thought your dreams needed changing.
My parents were murdered before me...... when I was a kid.
Flashes.
There' s a new element now, though, I haven' t seen before.
It' s a red leather book.
Something else...
My dreams come to me when I' m awake now.
Bruce, you' re describing repressed memories.
Images of a forgotten pain that' s trying to surface.
I' il be right back.
Is it possible there' s an aspect of your parents' death you haven' t faced?
You were so young when it happened.
Maybe I should leave you two alone.
This goes way beyond taking your work home, doesn' t it?
All right.
I think he' s fascinating.
Clinically.
Why does a man do this?
It' s as if he' s cursed to pay a penance.
What crime could he have committed to deserve a life of nightly torture?
It' s more than just...... professional interest, isn' t it, Chase?
Bruce, are you jealous?
No.
I can' t be jealous of Batman.
I want to be close, but you won' t let me near.
What are you protecting me from?
Do you want to know me?
Do you want to know who I am?
I guess...... we' re all two people.
The one in daylight, and the one we keep in shadow.
Rage...... violence...... passion.
Excuse me.
I' m busy.
I' m sorry to bother you.
I have some distressing news about Dick.
Is he okay?
I' m afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?
Not the Jaguar.
The other car.
The Bentley?
No, sir.
The other car.
Come for a little ride in my love machine, babies?
It' s Batman!
Open up, Batman.
Wait!
That' s not Batman!
What do you mean?
That' s Batboy!
It ain' t the Bat!
Let her go!
Who the hell are you?
I' m Batman.
I forgot my suit, all right?
Come on, run!
Doesn' t Batman ever kiss the girl?
Go!
Thanks, you saved my life!
I could definitely get into this superhero gig.
Bastard!
It should' ve been you!
If you had told Two- Face who you were at the circus...... they' d still be alive!
If Bruce Wayne could' ve given his life for your family, he would have.
All I can think about every day is getting Two- Face.
He took my whole life.
When I was out there tonight...... I imagined it was him I was fighting...... even when I was fighting you...... and the pain went away.
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.
Good.
You must help me find him.
When we do...... I' m the one who kills him.
So, you' re willing to take a life?
As long as it' s Two- Face.
Then it will happen this way:
You make the kill.
But your pain doesn' t die with Harvey, it grows.
So you run into the night to find another face, and another...... and another...... until one terrible morning you wake up and realize...... that revenge has become your whole life...... and you won' t know why.
You can' t understand.
Your family wasn' t killed by a maniac.
Yes, they were.
We' re the same.
If we' re the same, help me.
Train me, let me be your partner.
No.
I can' t.
You still have a choice.
Look, Bruce...... I' m a part of this, whether you like it or not.
Tonight all of Gotham society has turned out for Edward Nygma' s...... gala unveiling of his New Improved Box.
Thanks, Al.
My pleasure, sir.
They' il be dining and dancing the night away...... on the glamorous roof of the Ritz Gotham.
What' s it like to have your face on the cover of every magazine?
Edward, how does it feel to be the city' s newest, most- eligible bachelor?
Gotham must know!
There' s Bruce Wayne!
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!
How come you don' t look so good in that suit?
Shut up.
You' re here to work!
How' s my mole?
Fine.
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech takeover of Wayne Enterprises?
Nygma Tech stock is outselling Wayne Enterprises two to one.
Are you yesterday' s news, Bruce?
Bruce, old man.
The press wonders what it' s like to be outsold, outclassed, out- coifed and...... generally outdone in every way.
Hello, Edward.
Congratulations.
Great party.
Nice suit.
Good.
And you are?
Chase.
And what a grand pursuit you must be.
I' m Bruce Wayne, Miss...?
You can call me anything you want.
Ladies and gentlemen...... the future!
My New Improved Box offers fully- interactive holographic fantasies.
Edward, you' re dashing and a genius.
How do you create these images, hon?
That, my dear, is my little secret.
Fully- interactive holographs.
Only a high- frequency carrier wave, beamed into the brain...... could create such images.
And you wish you thought of it.
Don' t be a sore loser.
Give it a try.
If you can introduce images into the mind, what stops you from...... extracting images out of the mind?
Just say so.
Shall we dance?
Naughty, naughty.
Looking for something?
I was just wondering how you turn it off.
Clever.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Good evening, Mr. Wayne.
Relax.
Tell me your...... dreams.
Tell me...... your fantasies.
Tell me your secrets.
Tell me...... your deepest...... darkest...... fears.
Relax, folks!
It' s only an old- fashioned, low- tech stickup!
We' re interested in the basics:
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.
Hand them over nice and quietly, and no one will be hurt!
Emergency, Alfred.
Yes, sir.
Be calm, everybody!
Just stay calm!
Excuse me!
You' re ruining my big party!
Are you insane?
We' re sick of waiting for you to deliver Batman.
Patience, O Bifurcated One.
Patience, hell!
We want him dead!
And nothing brings out the Batman like a little murder and mayhem!
You could have let me in on the caper.
We could have organized it, planned it, pre- sold the movie rights!
Your entrance was good, his was better.
The difference?
Showmanship!
Emergency, Alfred.
Oh, sir...
I could be fired for this.
Perhaps they' il have me back at Buckingham Palace.
Phase Two!
My place, midnight.
Nothing like a bad case of gas!
Why can' t you just die?
Hi.
What were you doing?
You got a real gratitude problem, you know that?
I need a name.
Batboy?
Knight Wing?
What' s a good sidekick name?
"Dick Grayson, college student."
Screw you!
I saved your life.
You owe me.
You' re going to get yourself killed.
I' m your new partner.
No!
Whenever you go out at night, I' il be watching.
Where Batman goes, I' il go.
How will you stop me?
I can stop you.
Hang this next to the Batsuit...... where it belongs.
You' re encouraging him.
They need guidance.
You, above all, should know the consequences of the life you choose.
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.
Perhaps the lady is just what the doctor ordered.
She seems lovely and wise.
I' ve never been in love before.
Go to her.
Tell her how you feel.
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.
Let her decide.
I' m sorry.
I can' t believe this.
I' ve imagined this moment since I first saw you.
Your eyes...... your lips...... your body.
Now I have you and...... I' m wishing you were somebody else.
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.
I' ve met someone.
He' s not you.
I hope you can understand.
I understand.
Well...
That' s just what I said.
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:
How to map the human mind.
Would you like to see what Bruce Wayne has in his head?
Riddle me this:
What kind of man...... has bats on the brain?
- Go ahead.
- You' re a genius.
Oh, stop.
So, from this day on...... Batman is no more.
You can' t just quit.
There' s monsters out there.
Batman has to protect the innocent.
I' ve dedicated my life to helping strangers I' ve never met.
Faces I' ve never seen.
Well...... the innocent aren' t faceless anymore.
You can' t tell me what to do with the rest of my life.
My dad told me that every man goes his own way.
My way goes to Two- Face.
You must help me.
And if you do find Harvey...... and then you kill him...... what next?
Exactly.
Then you' d be alone, like me.
No, you must let this go.
Listen to me, I' m your friend.
I don' t need a friend, I need a partner.
Two- Face has got to pay.
Please.
Chase is coming for dinner.
I' m going to tell her...... everything.
Come upstairs.
We' il talk.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Happy Halloween.
Happy Halloween to you.
I asked you here tonight because there' s something I wanted to tell you.
I wanted to tell you something too.
What I wanted...
Go ahead, you first.
Trick or treat!
All my life I have been...... attracted to a certain kind of man.
The wrong kind.
Look at what I do for a living.
And since...... since I met you, I...
Oh, God.
Why am I so nervous?
Don' t eat too much tonight or you' il be sick in your beds.
Happy Halloween!
What' s wrong?
It' s happening again.
Flashes.
My parents' death.
Your memories are trying to break through.
Something I' ve never told anyone.
It' s all right.
It' s all right.
I' m here.
I' m here.
The night of my parents' wake...... the priest' s words gave no comfort.
Of course.
There, on my father' s desk...... the red book.
His journal.
He' d written in it every day.
But now he' d never write in it again.
At that moment I knew...... my life would never be the same.
I raced out into the storm...... trying to outrun the rage.
The pain.
Then I fell.
I fell forever.
The cave was monstrous.
It must have been there for centuries.
I saw...
It was coming toward me.
I was scared at first, but only at first.
The figure in the dark was my destiny.
It would change my life forever.
I would use its image to strike terror into the hearts of those who did evil.
I would ensure what happened to me would never happen to anyone else.
I would have my revenge.
What are you trying to tell me?
I' m...
Twick or tweet!
Trick.
Remember the plan?
Seize and capture.
No killing.
That goes double for you.
If I was a superhero...... where would I hide?
Spank me.
Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!
Shut up!
Now, that' s impressive!
It' s always risky introducing a tamed animal into the wild.
They may have trouble adapting to their new environment.
Somebody tell the fat lady...... she' s on in five.
"Joygasm!"
Get the girl!
Don' t kill him.
If you kill him...
... he won' t learn nothing.
Master Bruce!
How are you, young man?
You haven' t called me that for a long time.
Old habits die hard.
Are you all right?
Where' s Chase?
I' m afraid they' ve taken her.
Master Dick has run away.
The cave has been destroyed.
And there' s another riddle.
I' m coming, my sweet.
Like the jacket?
It keeps me safe when I' m...... jogging at night.
Batman will come for me.
Batman?
Batman, you say?
Coming for you?
I' m...... counting on it.
What is that?
Where' s it coming from?
There!
Who' s doing that?
The Riddler!
"We' re five little items of an everyday sort.
"You' il find us all in a tennis court."
In...
Vowels.
Not entirely unclever, sir.
But what do a clock, a match, chess pawns...... and vowels have in common?
What do these riddles mean?
Every riddle contains a number and they arrived in this order:
13, 1, 8...... and 5.
13, 1, 8 and 5.
Meaning?
Letters of the alphabet?
Of course, 13 is M.
1 would be A, 8 would be H and 5 would be E.
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.
18 is R.
M- R- E.
How about...... "Mr. E"?
- Mystery?
- Another name for mystery?
Enigma.
Mr. E. Nygma.
Edward Nygma.
Stickley' s suicide was obviously a computer- generated forgery.
You really are quite bright, despite what people say.
Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications.
Tonight' s a good night.
What do you suggest?
By sea...... or by air?
Why not both?
Who' s your tailor?
I took the liberty, sir.
"R?"
What' s that stand for?
Robin.
Riddler and Two- Face can make a pretty lethal combination.
You could use a hand.
Two against two are better odds.
I can' t promise I won' t kill Harvey.
"A man' s got to go his own way."
A friend taught me that.
Not just a friend.
A partner.
He' s not coming.
Shut it down.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Hey, go!
Hit!
Sweet!
Hit!
My favorite vitamin.
That sinking feeling.
I like this game.
C- 9.
You sunk my battleship!
Who, me?
This is your captain speaking.
Please return to your seats.
We will be experiencing turbulence.
I got him!
I hope they can find the little black box.
Now...... the real game begins.
Holy rusted metal, Batman!
The ground, it' s all metal.
It' s full of holes: holey.
Wait!
The whole island' s moving!
Looking for us?
That was for my mother!
My father!
My brother!
And this is for me!
Finally, justice is served!
Let us die!
You' re a man after our own heart, son!
I' il see you in hell!
I' d rather see you in jail!
Oh, good boy.
Good boy.
The Bat' s taught you well.
Noble.
Stupid...... but noble.
Riddle me this.
Riddle me that.
Who' s afraid of the big black bat?
No more tricks, Edward.
Very well, then.
Let' s get real.
Release Chase.
This is between you and me.
And me...... and me!
You' ve sucked Gotham' s brain waves and now you' ve devised a way to read minds.
You betcha!
Soon my little Box will be on countless TV' s around the world...... feeding me credit- card numbers...... bank codes...... sexual fantasies...... and little white lies.
Into my head they' il go.
Victory is inevitable.
For if knowledge is power...... then a god...... am...... I!
Was that over the top?
I can never tell.
By the way, I' ve seen your mind.
Yours is the greatest riddle of all!
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman ever truly coexist?
We' il find out today!
But first, let' s meet our contestants.
Behind curtain...... number one...
... the absolutely fabulous Dr. Chase Meridian!
She enjoys hiking, manicures...... and foolishly hopes to be the love of Bruce' s life.
Behind curtain number two...
... "Fatman' s" one and only partner.
This acrobat turned orphan...... likes Saturday- morning cartoons and dreams of one day being...... bare- naked with a girl.
And below these contestants...... my personal favorite:
A watery grave.
Just one little touch...... and five seconds later these two players are...... gull feed on the rocks below.
Not enough time to save them both.
Which one will it be, Batman?
Bruce' s love?
Or the Dark Knight' s junior partner?
There is no way for me to save them or myself.
It' s all one giant death- trap.
Judges?
Your answer must be in the form of a question.
But thank you for playing.
Wait!
I have a riddle for you.
For me?
Really?
Tell me.
I see without seeing.
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.
What am I?
Please!
You' re as blind as a bat!
Exactly.
Bummer!
Thanks.
All those heroics for nothing.
No more riddles, no more curtains one and two.
Just plain curtains!
Aren' t you forgetting something?
Your coin.
You' re always of two minds.
Yes, of course.
You' re right.
Emotion' s always the enemy of true justice.
You' ve always been a good friend.
Why?
Why can' t I...... kill you?
Too many questions.
Too many questions.
Poor Edward.
I had to save them both.
You see, I' m both Bruce Wayne and Batman.
Not because I have to be.
Now...... because I choose to be.
Thank you for responding to my request for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.
Edward Nygma...... has been screaming for hours that he knows the true identity...... of Batman.
Edward?
Who...... is it?
It' s Dr. Meridian.
Chase.
Do you remember me?
How could I forget?
Dr. Burton tells me...... you know who Batman is.
I can' t tell you if you don' t say, "please."
Edward, please.
Who is Batman?
I' m...... Batman.
Your secret is safe.
He is definitely a wacko.
"Wacko?"
Is that a technical term?
Listen...
... I won' t need this anymore.
Thank you for giving me a new dream.
Don' t work too late.
Subtitles conformed by SOFTlTLER
How Iong?
A day, maybe two.
They' re gone, Rob, and the beasts sold.
There' s a wee glen on the other side of Ben Duh.
I' d Iie there and kiII me some meat.
We' d not get there before dark.
Not stood here, we won' t.
You can smeII them through the meat.
Aye, if they fought as strong as they smeIled, we' d be in trouble.
They' re there right enough, just Iike you said, Rob.
We can rush them when they' re asleep.
10 of them to six of us.
One of them' s a woman.
Half of them would be dead before they were awake.
How wiII we take them, Rob?
I' II talk to them in the morning.
Iying wet arsed in the heather, chasing other men' s cattle.
Come away to the Americas with me.
They say there' s fine acres for the clearing in Virginia.
Aye, and they' II Iikely be as hard as these to sleep on.
Why are you going in to talk to them?
I know one of them.
Get up, you bunch of ragged- arsed tinker cow thieves!
This is Robert Roy McGregor come to reclaim the 32 beasts stolen from His Lordship James Graham,.. Marquis of Montrose.
StiII at your thieving.
Throw down now, and I' II spare you, aII but one.
There' s a price to being a Ieader of men, Tam.
By God, McGregor, if there' s any kiIling to be done, you' re the first.
Who do you think you are, acting the great chief?
And I know you' re a bigger thief than any of us.
Aye, but if I had stolen His Lordship' s cattle, you would not have walked into my dreams so easy.
I can caII the Gregorach and kiII the half of ya, or it can be between us and nothing more.
- Think on it, man.
Would you not rather be dead after a good hump. and a beIly fuII of stolen beef or have me march you back to Montrose to shit yourself on the gaIlows a month hence?
And you have my word no- one else wiII die!
Come, Iads.
Any man with a blade in his hands, cut him down.
Are ye men, or what are ye?
And him as much an outlaw as any of you!
You' re spittle!
You' re Ieavings!
Or I' m going to remember you, every Iast one.
You' re stealing from me, Robert Roy McGregor.
No man who steals my beasts makes a profit.
If you doubt me, ask Tam Sibbald.
What wiII you do with her?
Be on your way and teII no man you fared iII at our hands.
Go on.
Cut him down!
Go on.
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the contest is Guthrie!
Montrose, come hotfoot from the court to the cockpit.
His Grace, the Duke of ArgyIl.
I am Your Grace' s humble servant.
Another of your Iikely Iads?
Archibald is sent me by his mother in the hope that our climate might cooI the fever in his blood.
So, Mr Cunningham, what are these principaI sins that distress your mother?
Dice?
Drink?
Or are you a buggerer of boys?
And in my own defence, I thought him a girI at the moment of entry.
What say you, Guthrie, that Archie could not teII arse from quim?
Many Englishmen have that same difficulty.
Oh, spoken as weII as you fought.
Did you see Guthrie here at work, Mr Cunningham?
He has a fair hand with the cleaver.
You do not think much of our highland tools, then?
If I had to kiII an ox, a claymore would be my first choice, Your Grace.
You best use a musket and save the beast a slow dying.
I would not need a musket for you, Guthrie.
Oh, splendid!
I' II wager 100 of what you Iike on Guthrie and his cleaver.
At odds?
Now, come, James, you' re a fox.
What odds?
- Three?
- Two.
English pounds.
There' s more of a jingle to guineas.
- Ah, guineas it is.
- ExceIlent, exceIlent.
A bumper of rhenish for my Lord Montrose. and show Mr Cunningham what blades we have.
You honour me, sir, to serve me with your own hand.
I forget how much you dislike me untiI I' m in your presence.
So, what news at Court?
What else but the succession?
I fear she may pass over and Ieave the matter unresolved.
Would that she had seen a child Iive to comfort the kingdom.
One might have hoped that a field so often ploughed. might have yielded one good crop.
In truth, I have seen healthier graveyards. than that woman' s womb.
Come on!
I am asked on what side Your Grace wiII declare himself.
Where ArgyII goes, the path must be firm and broad.
And now aII watch to see which way to jump.
One cannot go to the closet but what some adherent to James is praising your pish.
I confess to a certain weariness in this whole issue and Iook to Your Grace to give some Iead.
Damn it, man.
You talk too much.
Can you not tend to your wager?
ArgyIl, my wager is weII won.
Damn it, Guthrie!
Is it not enough that you' re beaten but you must turn backstabber?
My factor wiII caII upon Your Grace' s factor.
Welcome back.
WeII done, Rob, man.
Cut out another of the cattle.
If the tinkers ate one, they could have eaten two.
Montrose wiII charge you, nonetheless.
I' m weary of seeing children hungry and old folk cold.
It' II take more than a cow to fix that.
You' II be in the Americas, Iiving off the fat, so it won' t worry ya.
- Have some broth, Rob.
- No, CoIl.
I' m for home.
God bless you, Rob.
Rob just walks in among them, his sword stiII in its sheath and says, "Get up, you bunch of ragged- arsed..."
HeIlo, Rob.
"Get up, you bunch of ragged- arsed cow thieves."
"TeII your crew to Iay down and I' II only cut your throat, else I' II caII my men."
We are ready.
I dreamed a silkie came.
And what did he do to you, your silkie?
You wakened me before the best of it, but he would have ravished me for certain.
How do you know you' re awake, wife?
Mr KiIlearn.
I' m on my way.
WeII on the way, I' d venture.
Let me be, Mr KiIlearn.
You' II wake him.
Don' t, Mr KiIlearn!
I' m sure the young master has you nicely greased, does he not?
Oh, Betty, you' d hardly feeI me going in.
A wee whiff of quim in the morning,
Just the thing to clear your head.
Mr Cunningham, I hope I' m not disturbing you.
Of course you' re bloody weII disturbing me.
Do you think I want to wake up and find some great smeIly Scotch man staring down at me?
What are you doing here?
I came to teII you that some IocaI trades people are pressing for payment on your debt.
You woke me for that?
A thousand apologies, Mr Cunningham, but they' ve also writ to His Lordship.
Damn it, man.
I but recently earned His Lordship 200 guineas.
What are the complaints of a few tradesmen for such services?
This country does not agree with me.
I cannot wait to be out of the damnable place.
The sentiments of a great many of us, sir.
Would you Iike me to take away your chamber pot?
I know many a Scotsman would be glad of this on a cold morning.
It' s almost pure spirit, and I' m no judge of a pint of pish.
I kiIled Tam Sibbald yesterday morning.
We played baII once at Creiff market.
I remember shouting, "WeII done, Tam", when he made a run.
And there he was, hung on the end of my dirk Iike meat.
WeIl, Iikely it was necessary.
Necessary enough to save worse.
Some of them had kin and clan.
They made me fear I might have come across one of our own among them.
McGregors are not tinkers.
But a hard winter or two away, some of us...
What' s gnawing on you, Robert?
I' ve made up my mind to borrow money from Montrose to buy cattle at Creiff market and seII at Carlisle.
How much money? £1, 000.
Believe me, Mary, it wiII turn profit. £6 in Creiff is £1 2 in Carlisle.
I can drive them faster and deliver them fatter than any man in the kingdom.
Why would the Marquis of Montrose Iend a McGregor £1, 000?
For profit, what else?
It' s an investment as much as a Ioan.
So it' s business partners you are now, you and the Marquis.
I didn' t teII you my mind to be flayed for it.
But you take too much to heart that cannot be helped.
It must be helped.
AII right, but not today.
Got the two of yous!
Father, wiII McGregors ever be kings again?
AII men with honour are kings, but not aII kings have honour.
What is honour?
Honour is what no man can give you and none can take away.
Honour is a man' s gift to himself.
Do women have it?
Women are the heart of honour, and we cherish and protect it in them.
You must never mistreat a woman or malign a man, nor stand by and see another do so.
How do you know if you have it?
Never worry on the getting of it.
It grows in you and speaks to you.
AII you need do is Iisten.
You' ve animals to tend to and water to haul.
Your mother and me wiII be down directly.
Take the basket.
Do you know how fine you are to me, Mary McGregor?
So fine.
Is that why you sent them away?
To teII me how fine I am?
Or did you want to make a silk purse out of my sow' s ear again?
What a wanton I' m wed to.
You know what the old wives say about these standing stones?
What do the old wives say,... old wife?
Ow!
Come here.
What do they say?
So, what do they say?
They say the stones make men hard and women fertile.
We' ve no need of them, you and me.
You know how fine you are to me, Robert McGregor?
This tailor in Glasgow to whom you owe £87 extended this credit because you were my guest?
Or as you prefer to frame it, a member of my household.
I have in no manner indebted him.
And now KiIlearn teIls me that you are saddling one of my serving wenches.
Your mother did not send you to me to debauch innocent girls.
I regret that I have so offended Your Lordship.
By your Ieave, I wiII remove myself.
And to where, might I ask?
You know no- one.
To where would you remove yourself?
Have you some notion of presenting yourself at the Duke of ArgyIl' s door and soliciting his patronage as his new champion?
I am Your Lordship' s to command.
Remember your place, sir!
That' s aII I ask of any man.
What is next?
McGregor, My Lord.
You may go, Archibald.
You bear no arms?
I hadn' t planned on demanding terms at sword point.
Robert McGregor of Craigrostan, My Lord.
I knew your father, an able man, if not a wise one.
Have you taken on his mantle?
As best I may, My Lord.
So, how many men are you master of?
Master of none, My Lord, but some 200 souls Iive close by Craigrostan, and they' re in my care.
You are a profit and provider to them, is that not so?
What I can, I do.
It is no great matter compared to Your Lordship' s work.
To know one' s place, McGregor, in the order of things is a great blessing.
What terms, KiIlearn?
A fifth, My Lord.
A fifth, you say?
What, is this man kin that you offer such kindly terms?
Am I not accustomed to a quarter on unsecured Ioans?
McGregor has 300 acres at Craigrostan, My Lord.
A man of property intent on growing richer.
WeIl, we have more in common than I would have suspected, McGregor. £1, 000 for 3 months, you say, and these acres of yours as security?
And my oath.
TeII me, is there something in what KiIlearn says that you might have driven off my cattle and returned them with stories of tinkers caught and summarily executed?
I have, in my day, thieved cattle, but none that were under my watch.
Is that what passes for honour with a McGregor?
What passes for honour with me is Iikely enough the same as with Your Lordship.
When my word is given, it is good.
WeIl, you are to be congratulated on such cheaply bought nobility.
KiIlearn wiII draw papers.
I wiII expect the terms to be met.
My thanks to Your Lordship.
Aye, but it' s a fine, bold signature you have, worthy of a chieftain himself.
Are you Rob Roy McGregor?
And what' s your name?
Davey Anderson.
HeIlo, Davey Anderson.
Even the servant boys know who you are.
You' ve become a famous reiver and retriever in your own Iifetime.
Business and profit.
And a soft winter.
Are you Rob Roy McGregor?
I am.
I' m WiII Guthrie.
You heard of me?
No, I have not.
WeIl, I' ve heard of you.
Indeed.
And what have you heard, Mr Guthrie?
I heard you backstabbed Tam Sibbald.
Were you and Tam kin?
Near enough.
I shagged his sister.
Likely so did Tam.
You want the wind Iet out of your bladder?
What' s your business with me, Guthrie?
Business best done outside.
We have no quarrel.
That can be remedied.
The first cut?
Aye.
WeII done.
Some other time when we' re both sober.
Tam Sibbald has a Ionger reach dead than he ever did Iiving.
I' m away home.
Keep the pony and stick to KiIlearn tiII you have the note.
I' m to wait here tiII the note is signed.
We are the obedient one.
Fetch and carry at command.
Why has a smart young Iad Iike you attached himself to a bunch of tinkers?
I would have thought you more fit. to serve a man Iike my master, the Marquis of Montrose.
I do not serve Robert McGregor.
I' m his friend and count myself fortunate to claim it.
My God, what a crew you Highlanders are.
With your airs and honours, come begging £1, 000 as if you were doing the Iender a favour.
Sheep shaggers, the Iot of ya.
My mother could come no nearer than three candidates for my paternity.
Now, there' s a name for a whore master.
A secretary to the Spanish Ambassador whose name she hazarded as Ferdinando and some young buck she never saw who raised her skirts at the masked baIl.
He ravished her?!
I would put it no higher than surprised.
Archie, take me with you.
Take me away with you.
I am away, Betty, and God help me, this is where I' ve Ianded.
You think me a gentleman because I have Iinen and can manage a lisp.
I am but a bastard abroad, seeking my fortune and the favours of great men, as big a whore as my mother ever was.
I' m pregnant by you, Archie.
WeIl.
When it asks for its father' s name, at Ieast you' II have it to give.
KiIlearn.
A word with you.
Don' t Iet him see me.
You are a carbuncle on this arse of a country.
I' II squeeze the pus out of you with my bare hands.
My, Archie, but you have a rare contempt in you.
I gave you no Ieave to caII me familiar.
At a fair price.
What are you gibbering about?
Money, Archie.
What else?
How much money?
Let' s talk inside over a dram.
It' s chiII on the stairs.
Say what you have to say.
I am engaged within.
Ah, you' ve Betty on her back.
How much money? £1, 000. £1, 000.
What does £1, 000 Iook Iike?
WiII we have enough ponies to carry it?
Not coin.
A note of credit drawn on His Lordship.
- What interest, Rob?
And he gets £200 profit for three months?
Aye.
That' s the price of cash, and we must plan the matter to the Iast penny.
When Alan returns, he' II take three of you, and you' II go to Creiff.
There you' II bargain with the drovers and have the herd assembled when I come with our kit for the drive.
How big a herd?
300.
Maybe more.
And whatever we can acquire along the way.
No harm if a dozen or more stick.
We' II drive them into Carlisle Iike an army.
So, Iet' s have aII hands to it.
We' II stay warm this winter, within and without.
To celebrate, we' II hold a gathering and drink to our success!
That' s two shiIlings stiII owing.
Colqhoun, what have you got?
A rabbit?
You' re stiII a week behind, Colqhoun.
Must I wait aII day for my note, KiIlearn?
Your turn is marked.
Take you that goat to the pen.
Come, young Davey Wilson.
Another rabbit.
- Does nobody have any money?
- No, sir.
Only a rabbit.
Dreaming of the New World, were we?
I hear teII in the New World they have tribes of noble savages with paint on their faces and skins on their backs.
You' II be weII at home among them.
Enough of this tripe.
Have you the note?
Great doings at the Court.
And he' s away without signing the note.
The best I can do for you is coin.
This was not agreed.
Agreed or no, there' s £1, 000 here.
Take it or Ieave it, it makes no difference to me, nor to His Grace.
Aye, it' s a terrible shock, the sight of such a fortune within reach, is it not?
It' s just as weII you have the trust of the McGregor or I' d be hard pressed to sign it over to you.
Angus.
A great gathering, Rob.
That Alasdair Roy is a fierce dancer.
- you were flat on your back.
Do not affront me afore these folk.
Rob, do you know why Calvinists are against shagging standing up?
I do not.
They fear it might Iead to dancing.
Stay back, or by God, I' II shoot you dead.
For a moment there, I thought you might take the road to Greenock with your £1, 000.
KiIling is not so easy as it seems.
La.
He sat out there aII day, pondering on this.
- You gave him coin.
- He insisted upon it.
When I told him His Grace hadn' t signed the note, he said you must have it, or the beasts could not be bought at the best price.
I' m hard put to see you hand over such a sum to one who couldn' t bear the debt.
He was your man, present at your signing of the terms, ordered by you to wait.
For a note, not a bag of guineas!
It was not aII guineas.
These farmers pay in smaII coin, I assure you.
He signed for this bag of coin?
He did.
Almost as bold a hand as yourself.
There best be no skulduggery here, KiIlearn.
Alan McDonald stands under my protection.
WeIl, that' s a great comfort to us aIl, I must say, what with £1, 000 at risk.
We must search for Alan.
I fear he' s come to mischief hereabouts.
I say we Iook in Greenock.
It comes quickly to your mind that he has robbed us.
He spoke of the Americas often enough.
And he walked to Greenock from Buchlyvie and sent his pony home without him? £1, 000 would be enough to buy him 10 ponies.
Alan McDonald did not betray me.
Now to it and find his trace.
To it!
Go to Greenock, then since you have that stink in your nose.
But, brother, bad enough that it might be so without you wishing it.
Rob.
The ship sailed the day before I got there, and McDonald' s name was not on the harbourmaster' s Iist.
But he wouldn' t have Iikely used his own name and him run off with... 1, 000...
Your Lordship, the Duke of ArgyII this way comes.
John, you Iook Iike a man who means to play hard.
Do not presume to speak above your station, sir!
I wiII have my rank from you!
Your Grace.
I have word from Court that you' re saying I' m a Jacobite, as one who would rise for the Stuart should he Iand here to claim the throne.
Great men such as yourself draw rumours as shite draws flies.
You are the shite, Montrose, and the flies upon it!
I know you in my nose.
Keep your stink off my name, or by God, I wiII clip you as close as one of your gelded trees, and this carrion you keep wiII not come between us!
What pride to use a feIlow peer in public so!
Damn his pride!
Damn His Grace' s pride.
Why is it so beyond your belief that he might have yielded to the sight of aII that money?
Unguarded, unasked, but there a Iifetime' s wages in a bag.
Because I know him.
I know him more than half his Iife.
But was he ever handed £1, 000 before?
He was handed a hundred times more.
Why do you not believe me?
He did not steaI from you.
But he has gone, the money' s gone, and Montrose wiII not care if you believe one thing or the other.
- No.
Else our home is Iost and ourselves His Lordship' s tenants.
Ah, here comes the bold Highlander.
No arse in his breeks but too proud to tug his forelock.
No doubt the rogue seeks to blame his servant for I hear there is no word of the man.
I see you' re back in favour with your tailor, Archibald.
So, McGregor, how is it with you?
There is stiII no word of McDonald or Your Lordship' s money.
What are we to do, then?
If Your Lordship would contract with me for another sum,
I would turn over aII profit and so repay my debt.
You ask me to risk another?
My Lord, the money was stolen from me and from you.
I am no part of your incompetence.
You signed a paper.
And I wiII honour it.
Oh, ply me not with your honour, man.
Let us keep these matters simple.
You are indebted to me.
On that we are agreed?
Know you the Duke of ArgyIl?
By his repute alone.
My report is that ArgyII is a Jacobite and would declare for James Stuart should he seek to reclaim the throne.
These are inteIligences unknown to me, My Lord.
They are known to you now.
I' m uncertain of Your Lordship' s meaning.
You and your clan are Jacobites bred to the bone.
ArgyII is nothing to you.
I want your word against him.
Give it, and we wiII come to some reckoning on what you owe me.
I can be of no assistance to Your Lordship in this matter of the Duke of ArgyIl.
You owe me.
Nothing more.
What you have asked is as below me as it should be beneath Your Lordship.
You misspeak yourself, McGregor.
It is the Marquis of Montrose who has misspoke himself to ask my perjury against his enemies.
This is not your quarrel.
You do not hear me, McGregor.
I did not ask if or whether.
UntiI that is settled, I wiII have you Iodged in the tolbooth.
Take him into custody, Archibald.
You have my commission on it!
- I wiII not go there, sir.
- CaII out the watch!
CaII nothing, or I' II cut his throat!
You are damned, McGregor.
Leave the deviI some work.
You' ve done enough for one day.
CaII out the watch!
You have slept your Iast peacefuI night, McGregor.
You and yours.
What is John CampbeIl, Duke of ArgyIl, to us that you must defend him against Montrose?
I refused to bear false witness against him.
Gregor, send men to the passes and set watches.
And the Iochside?
They' II not Iikely come by the shore, but watch aII ways.
I have to go to the hiIls for a time.
You stay by your mother and be her help, you hear?
Let ArgyII know that you are persecuted for his sake.
I' m persecuted for no man' s sake but my own, Mary.
What?
Would you have me Iie against my conscience to suit Montrose?
No!
To suit me and Duncan and Ranald, to stay home with your wife and children instead of taking to the hiIls Iike a fox.
Out!
He' II be with you soon enough!
She' II make a place.
And Iet Montrose' s troopers fouI my house.
Montrose' s quarreI is with me.
And you reveI in it.
The great man against aIl.
And Iikely you' II slip down in the night when the mood takes you.
Or wiII you just find yourself a sheep to comfort you?
If I do, it wiII be one that doesn' t bleat so bitter.
Give no cause.
This is between me and Montrose, and Iikely when he' s broke a few horses, he' II quieten down.
Watch Alasdair.
Keep up the watch for McDonald.
Ach, Rob, he' s Iong gone.
Aye, but is he over the seas or under them?
She' s sore at me for this business.
Heaven protect us from his Iike.
When the King comes across the water again, we' II see him hung.
I have some knowledge of how best to bring such rogues to heel.
Broken but not dead, Archibald.
That is aII I ask.
Broken but not dead.
It has a ring to it.
Your health.
Instead of spying them out, we should Iay for them and cut them down as they come through the passes.
Aye, a wee war with Montrose would suit us fine.
Keep your watch, give warning, and stay your hand, or you' II answer to me.
Damn that McDonald has brought this on us.
Always at Rob' s arse Iike a coIlie dog.
Saw him drowned.
Maybe his ship sank and him Ioaded down with the theft.
Wheesht!
Wheesht!
Quickly!
Get out of bed!
Bring the Gregorach!
I' ve come for the outlaw Robert McGregor.
If you think he' d be Iying in his bed waiting for you, you' re more of a fooI than you Iook.
KiII the stock.
You best stand aside, Mistress McGregor.
You make her.
No!
No!
People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden.
Tyler:
3 minutes.
This is it: ground zero.
Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels.
For a second I totally forget about Tyler' s whole controlled demolition thing, and I wonder how clean that gun is.
Getting exciting now.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love?
Well, it works both ways.
We have front row seats for this theater of mass destruction.
The demolitions committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.
In 2 minutes, primary charges will blow base charges and a few square blocks will be reduced to smoldering rubble.
I know this... because Tyler knows this.
2 1/ 2.
Think of everything we' ve accomplished.
And suddenly, I realize that all of this: the gun, the bombs, the revolution... has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.
Bob.
Bob had bitch- tits.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.
The big moosey slobbering all over me, that was Bob.
We' re still men.
Yes, we' re men.
Men is what we are.
8 months ago, Bob' s testicles were removed.
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch- tits because his testosterone was too high, and his body upped the estrogen.
Narrator:
You cry now.
No, wait.
Back up.
For 6 months, I couldn' t sleep.
I couldn' t sleep.
With insomnia, nothing' s real.
Everything' s far away.
Everything' s a copy of a copy of a copy.
When deep space exploration ramps up, it' il be the corporations that name everything: the I. B. M. Stellarsphere, the Microsoft Galaxy,
Planet Starbucks.
We got some red flags to cover.
It must' ve been Tuesday.
He was wearing his cornflower- blue tie.
You want me to deprioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Make these your primary action items.
Call me from the road if there' s any snags.
He was full of pep.
Must have had his grandé latté enema.
Like so many others, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
I' d like to order the Erica Pekkary dust ruffles.
Operator:
like a little coffee table in the shape of a Yin- Yang,
The Klipske personal office unit, the Hovetrekke home exer- bike, or the Johannshamn sofa with the Strinne green stripe pattern.
Even the Rizlampa wire lamps of environmentally friendly unbleached paper.
What kind of dining set defines me as a person?
I had it all.
Proof that they were crafted by the honest, simple, hard- working indigenous peoples of --
Narrator:
We used to read pornography.
Now it was the Horchow collection.
No, you can' t die from insomnia.
What about narcolepsy?
I wake up in strange places.
I have no idea how I got there.
You need to lighten up.
Can you please just get me something?
Red and blue Tuenols, lipstick- red Seconals.
No.
You need healthy natural sleep.
Chew some Valerian root and get more exercise.
Hey, come on.
I' m in pain.
Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.
See the guys with testicular cancer.
That' s pain.
La la la
I always wanted 3 kids, 2 boys and a girl.
Mindy wanted 2 girls and a boy.
We never could agree on anything.
Well, uh, you know, she --
She had her first child last week, a... a girl.
With -- With her, uh, with her new husband.
Fuck.
I' m -- I' m glad for her.
Because she deserves it.
Everyone, let' s thank Thomas for sharing himself with us.
Thank you, Thomas.
I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage, and that gives me strength.
We give each other strength.
It' s time for the one- on- ones.
So let' s all of us here follow Thomas' good example and really open ourselves up.
Would you find a partner?
Man:
Let' s go over here.
His eyes already shrink- wrapped in tears... knees together, those awkward little steps.
My name is Bob.
Bob.
Bob had been a champion body- builder.
You know that chest- expansion program you see on late- night TV?
That was his idea.
I was a juicer.
You know, using steroids.
Wistrol.
Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Christ sakes.
And now I' m bankrupt.
I' m divorced.
My 2 grown kids... won' t even return my phone calls.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Go ahead, Cornelius.
[Crying]
And then, something happened.
I let go.
That' s really good.
Lost in oblivion... dark and silent and complete.
I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.
It' s OK.
Babies don' t sleep this well.
I became addicted.
If I didn' t say anything... people always assumed the worst.
Welcome, Travis.
They cried harder... then I cried harder.
Now we' re going to open the green door, the heart chakra.
I wasn' t really dying.
I wasn' t host to cancer or parasites.
I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around. that the life of this world crowded around.
Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light.
It moves over your body, healing you.
Now, keep this going.
Remember to breathe, and step forward through the back door of the room.
Where does it lead?
To your cave.
Step forward into your cave.
That' s right.
You' re going deeper into your cave, and you' re going to find your power animal.
Slide.
[Giggles]
Narrator:
Every evening, I died... and every evening, I was born again.
Resurrected.
Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed, too.
Being there... pressed against his tits, ready to cry.
This was my vacation.
And she ruined everything.
This is cancer, right?
This chick Marla Singer did not have testicular cancer.
She was a liar.
She had no diseases at all.
I had seen her at Free and Clear my blood parasites group Thursdays.
Then at Hope, my bimonthly sickle cell circle.
[Coughs Softly]
Marla, the big tourist.
Her lie reflected my lie, and suddenly, I felt nothing.
I couldn' t cry.
So once again, I couldn' t sleep.
Marla Singer and scream...
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist!
Now get out!
I hadn' t slept in 4 days.
We' il just let that dry.
When you have insomnia, you' re never really asleep... and you' re never really awake.
Chloe would like to say a few words.
Oh, yeah...
Meryl Streep' s skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around the party being extra nice to everybody.
Well, I' m still here, but I don' t know for how long.
That' s as much certainty as anyone can give me.
But I' ve got some good news.
I no longer have any fear of death.
But I am in a pretty lonely place.
No one will have sex with me.
I' m so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time.
I have pornographic movies in my apartment,
and lubricants and amyl nitrate.
Chloe...
Everyone, let' s thank Chloe.
[Audience Saying Thank You]
Now, let' s... ready ourself for guided meditation.
You' re standing at the entrance of your cave.
You step inside your cave, and you walk.
If I did have a tumor...
I' d name it Marla.
Marla... the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can' t.... deeper into your cave as you walk.
You feel the healing energy of this place all around you.
Now find your power animal.
Slide.
OK.
Now let' s partner up.
Pick someone special to you tonight.
Hey.
We need to talk.
Sure.
I' m onto you.
What?
You' re a faker.
You' re not dying.
Sorry?
I know we' re all -- we' re all dying, all right?
So?
So you' re a tourist.
I saw you -- saw you at melanoma, saw you at tuberculosis,
I saw you at testicular cancer.
I saw you practicing this.
Practicing what?
Is it going as well as you hoped...
"RUPERT"?
I' il expose you.
Go ahead.
All right, come together.
Let yourselves cry.
[Crying Softly]
Oh, God, why are you doing this?
It' s cheaper than a movie, and there' s free coffee.
No, look... this is important, OK?
I' ve been coming here for over a year.
Why do you do it?
I don' t know.
When people think you' re dying, man, they really, really listen to you instead of just...
Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
Yeah.
Share yourself... completely.
OK, you don' t want to get into this.
It becomes an addiction.
Really?
I' m not kidding.
I can' t cry if there' s another faker present, and I need this.
So you got to find somewhere else to go.
Candy stripe a cancer ward.
It' s not my problem.
Wait, wait, wait.
I' il tell you.
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis --
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn' t go over at all.
- OK.
Good.
Testicular cancer should be no contest, I think.
I have more right to be there than you.
You still have your balls.
You' re kidding.
I don' t know.
No.
No.
What do you want?
I' il take the parasites.
You can' t have both the parasites, but why don' t you take the blood parasites --
I want brain parasites.
I' il take the blood parasites, but I' m gonna take the organic brain dementia --
You can' t have the whole brain.
I only have 2.
OK.
They' re yours.
Now we both have 3.
Hey, you left half your clothes!
[Horn Honking]
What, are you selling those?
I' m selling some clothes.
That' s 6.
What about the seventh day?
I want ascending bowel cancer.
Thank you.
No.
No, I...
I want bowel cancer.
That' s your favorite, too?
Try to slip it by me, eh?
Look, we' re gonna split it, OK?
Take the first and third Sunday of the month.
Deal.
Looks like this is good- bye.
Well, let' s not make a big thing out of it, OK?
How' s this for not making a big thing?
Hey, Marla!
Marla!
May- Maybe we should exchange numbers.
Should we?
OK.
This is how I met Marla Singer.
Marla' s philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn' t.
Who are you,
Cornelius, Rupert,
Travis, any of the stupid names you give each night?
You wake up at Seatac.
S. F. O...
L. A. X...
Dallas- Fort Worth...
B. W. I...
Pacific, mountain, central...
Lose an hour, gain an hour...
Check- in for that flight doesn' t begin for another 2 hours, sir.
This is your life, and it' s ending one minute at a time.
You wake up at Air Harbor International...
If you wake up at a different time, in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?
Everywhere I travel, tiny life... single- serving sugar... single- serving cream... single pat of butter... a microwave cordon- bleu hobby kit.
Shampoo- conditioner combos.
Sample package mouthwash, tiny bars of soap.
The people I meet on each flight, they' re single- serving friends.
Between takeoff and landing, we have our time together, but that' s all we get.
Welcome!
On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.
Here' s where the infant went through the windshield.
A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60 miles per hour.
The teenager' s braces are wrapped around the back seat ashtray.
Might make a good antismoking ad.
The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.
Now, should we initiate a recall?
The father must' ve been huge.
You see where the fat has burned to the seat, the polyester shirt?
- Ha ha ha!
Narrator:
Take the number of vehicles in the field, "A," multiply it by the probable rate of failure, "B," then multiply the result by the average out- of- court settlement, "C."
"A" times "B" times "C" equals "X."
If" X "is less than the cost of a recall, we don' t do one.
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
You wouldn' t believe.
Which car company do you work for?
A major one.
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.
Anything.
Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.
"And you feel you would be unable or unwilling to perform the duties
It' s a lot of responsibility.
Wanna switch seats?
I' m not sure I' m the man for that particular job.
An exit- door procedure at 30, 000 feet.
Mm- hmm.
The illusion of safety.
I guess so.
You know why they put oxygen masks on planes?
So you can breathe.
Oxygen gets you high.
In a catastrophic emergency, you' re taking giant panicked breaths.
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.
You accept your fate.
It' s all right here.
Emergency water landing -- 600 miles an hour.
Blank faces, calm as Hindu cows.
That' s, um...
That' s an interesting theory.
What do you do?
What do you do for a living?
So you can pretend like you' re interested?
OK.
You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
We have the exact same briefcase.
Soap.
Sorry?
I make and I sell soap -- the yardstick of civilization.
And this is how I met...
"Tyler Durden."
Did you know, if you mixed equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate, you can make napalm?
No, I did not know that.
Is that true?
That' s right.
One can make all kinds of explosives using simple household items.
Really?
If one were so inclined.
"single- serving" friend I' ve ever met.
See, obviously, everything on a plane is single- serving, even --
Oh, I get it.
It' s very clever.
Thank you.
How' s that working out for you?
Being clever.
Great.
Keep it up, then.
Right up.
Now a question of etiquette.
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?
Narrator:
How I came to live with Tyler is... airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.
Was -- Was it ticking?
'cause modern bombs don' t tick.
Sorry.
"Throwers"?
Baggage handlers.
But when a suitcase vibrates, then the thrower' s gotta call the police.
My suitcase... was vibrating?
9 times out of 10, it' s an electric razor, but every once in a while...
it' s a dildo.
Of course, it' s company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.
Never your dildo.
I don' t own a --
Narrator:
I had everything in that suitcase -- my CK shirts, my DKNY shoes, my AX ties.
Never mind.
Hey!
That' s my car!
[Siren]
Home was a condo on the 15th floor of a filing cabinet for widows and young professionals.
The walls were solid concrete.
A foot of concrete' s important when your next- door neighbor lets her hearing aid go and has to watch game shows at full volume...
Or when a volcanic blast and debris that used to be your furniture and personal effects blows out of your floor- to- ceiling windows and sails flaming into the night.
[Helicopter Circling]
I suppose these things happen.
There' s nothing up there.
You can' t go into the unit.
Police orders.
Do you have somebody you can call?
How embarrassing.
A house full of condiments and no food.
letting out just a little bit of gas.
That gas could have slowly filled the condo -- 1, 700 square feet of high ceilings for days and days.
[Telephone Ringing]
Yeah?
I can hear you breathing, you --
I couldn' t tell you why I called him.
[Telephone Ringing On Other End]
[Ring]
Hello?
[Potato Chips Crunching]
Tyler?
Who is this?
Um, ahem, we met on the airplane.
We had the same suitcase.
Uh, the clever guy.
Oh, yeah.
OK?
I called a second ago.
I' m at a pay phone.
I star- 69ed you.
I never pick up my phone.
So, what' s up, man?
Uh, well... you' re not gonna believe this.
You know, man, it could be worse.
A woman could cut off your penis while you' re sleeping and toss it out the window of a moving car.
There' s always that.
I don' t know, it' s just... when you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that' s it.
That' s the last sofa I' m gonna need.
I' ve got that sofa problem handled.
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent, a wardrobe that was getting very respectable.
I was close to being complete.
Shit, man.
Now it' s all gone.
All gone.
All gone.
Do you know what a duvet is?
Comforter.
It' s a blanket. just a blanket.
Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is?
Is this essential to our survival in the hunter- gatherer sense of the word?
No.
What are we, then?
We' re, uh, you know, consumers...
We' re consumers.
We are by- products of a lifestyle obsession.
Murder, crime, poverty -- these things don' t concern me.
What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy' s name on my underwear.
Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.
Martha Stewart.
Fuck Martha Stewart.
Martha' s polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It' s all going down, man.
So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.
I say, never be complete.
I say, stop being perfect.
let' s evolve.
Let the chips fall where they may.
But that' s me, and I could be wrong.
Maybe it' s a terrible tragedy.
No.
It' s not a tragedy, but...
Well, you did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living.
No.
I don' t smoke.
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...
What?
The things you own end up owning you.
But do what you like, man.
Oh, it' s late.
Hey, thanks for the beer.
Yeah, man.
I should find a hotel.
What?
What?
A hotel.
Yeah. just ask, man.
What are you talking about?
3 pitchers of beer, and you still can' t ask.
What?
You called me 'cause you needed a place to stay.
Oh, hey, no, no, no.
Yes, you did.
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Yeah.
Thanks.
I want you to do me a favor.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.
Tyler was a night person.
While the rest of us were sleeping, he worked.
He had one part- time job as a projectionist.
See, a movie doesn' t come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.
So someone has to be there to switch the projectors at the exact moment that one reel ends and the next one begins.
If you look for it, you can see these little dots come into the upper right- hand corner of the screen.
In the industry, we call them "cigarette burns."
That' s the cue for a changeover.
He flips the projectors, the movie keeps right on going, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Why would anyone want this shit job?
Because it affords him other interesting opportunities.
Like splicing single frames of pornography into family films.
So when the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices meet for the first time in reel 3, that' s when you' il catch a flash of Tyler' s contribution to the film.
Nobody knows that they saw it, but they did.
A nice big cock.
[Crying]
Even a hummingbird couldn' t catch Tyler at work.
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.
He was the guerilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Do not watch.
And as for the cream of mushroom soup, well...
You get the idea.
What do you want me to do?
You just want me to hit you?
Do me this one favor.
Why?
I don' t know.
I' ve never been in a fight.
Have you?
No, but that' s a good thing.
No, it is not.
I don' t wanna die without any scars.
So, come on, hit me before I lose my nerve.
God, this is crazy.
So go crazy.
Let 'er rip.
Hey, I don' t know about this.
I don' t, either, but who gives a shit?
No one' s watching.
What do you care?
This is crazy.
You want me to hit you?
That' s right.
What, like, in the face?
Surprise me.
This is so fucking stupid.
Motherfucker!
You hit me in the ear.
Ow!
Christ!
Why the ear, man?
That was perfect.
Uhh!
Nah, it' s all right.
That really hurts.
Right.
[Laughing]
You hit me.
Come on.
We should do this again sometime.
Where' s your car?
What car?
[Belches]
I don' t know how Tyler found that house, but he said he' d been there for a year.
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.
Most of the windows were boarded up.
There was no lock on the front door from when the police or whoever kicked it in.
The stairs were ready to collapse.
I didn' t know if he owned it or if he was squatting.
Neither would have surprised me.
Yeah.
That' s you.
That' s me.
That' s the toilet.
Thanks.
Narrator:
[Springs Clang]
Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.
There were no neighbors, just some warehouses and a paper mill -- that fart smell of steam, the hamster cage smell of wood chips.
What have we here?
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.
I didn' t miss TV.
I didn' t even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.
Can I be next?
All right, man.
Lose the tie.
Ooh!
At night, Tyler and I were alone for a half a mile in every direction.
[Clang]
Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.
Everywhere were rusted nails to snag your elbow on.
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut- in.
Hey, man, what are you reading?
It' s an article written by an organ in the first person.
"I am Jack' s medulla oblongata.
Without me, Jack could not regulate his heart rate, blood pressure, or breathing. "
There' s a whole series of these.
"I am Jack' s colon."
"I get cancer.
I kill Jack. "
Whoa -- Ohh!
After fighting, everything else in your life got the volume turned down.
[Muted Complaining]
You could deal with anything.
Have you finished those reports?
If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?
I' d fight my boss, probably.
Really?
Yeah.
Why, who would you fight?
I' d fight my dad.
I don' t know my dad.
I mean, I know him, but he left when I was, like, 6 years old, married this other woman and had some other kids.
He, like, did this every 6 years.
He goes to a new city and starts a new family.
Fucker should open up franchises.
My dad never went to college, so it was real important that I go.
That sounds familiar.
So I graduate, I call him up long distance.
I say, "Dad, now what?"
He says, "Get a job."
Same here.
I make my yearly call again.
I say, "Dad, now what?"
He says, "I don' t know.
Get married. "
I can' t get married.
I' m a 30- year- old boy.
We' re a generation of men raised by women.
I' m wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.
But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.
We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.
It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed,
I' d just clean my condo, polish my Scandinavian furniture.
I should' ve been haggling with my insurance company.
I should' ve been upset about my nice, neat flaming little shit.
But I wasn' t.
The basic premise of cyber- netting any office is make things more efficient.
Monday mornings, all I could do was think about next week.
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
Absolutely.
Efficiency is priority number one, people, because waste is a thief.
I showed this already to my man, here.
You liked it, didn' t you?
You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.
It was right in everyone' s face.
Tyler and I just made it visible.
It was on the tip of everyone' s tongue.
Tyler and I just gave it a name.
Come on, people, you gotta go home.
Turn off the jukebox.
Lock the back.
Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.
Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club.
The first rule of Fight Club is... you do not talk about Fight Club.
The second rule of Fight Club is... you do not talk about Fight Club.
Third rule of Fight Club --
Someone yells "Stop!" goes limp, taps out, the fight is over.
Fourth rule --
Only 2 guys to a fight.
Fifth rule --
One fight at a time, fellas.
[Laughter]
Sixth rule -- No shirts, no shoes.
Seventh rule --
Fights will go on as long as they have to.
And the eighth and final rule --
If this is your first night at Fight Club... you have to fight.
[Loud Shouting, Cheering]
This kid from work, Ricky, couldn' t remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black...
But Ricky was a god for 10 minutes when the trounced the maitre d 'of a local food court.
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling...
or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed...
Stop!
You weren' t alive anywhere like you were there.
But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and when Fight Club ends.
I wouldn' t be talking to the same man.
Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were in the rest of the world.
The guy who came to Fight Club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight?
Alive or dead?
It doesn' t matter.
Hemingway.
You?
I' d fight William Shatner.
We all started seeing things differently.
Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up.
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms, trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
Is that what a man looks like?
Self- improvement is masturbation.
And self- destruction.
Excuse me.
[Screaming]
Fight Club wasn' t about winning or losing.
It wasn' t about words.
like in a Pentecostal church.
- Stop!
When the fight was over, nothing was solved, but nothing mattered.
Hey, cool.
Narrator:
Afterwards, we all felt saved.
Hey, man, how about next week?
How about next month?
Irwin, you' re in the middle.
You, too.
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.
He fell down some stairs.
I fell down some stairs.
Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.
Any historical figure.
I' d fight Gandhi.
Good answer.
How about you?
Lincoln.
Lincoln?
Mm.
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they' re burger.
Fuck.
Even the Mona Lisa' s falling apart.
[Ring]
Hello.
Where have you been the last 8 weeks?
Marla?
[Chop Socky Yell]
How' d you find me?
You left that forwarding number.
I haven' t seen you in any support groups.
We split them up.
That was the idea, remember?
Yeah, but you haven' t been going to yours.
How do you know?
I cheated.
I found a new one.
Really?
Like the testicle thing?
Waaah!
Look, this is a bad time.
I' ve been going to Debtors Anonymous.
You wanna see some really fucked up people?
I' m just on my way out.
I' ve got a stomachful of Xanax.
I took what was left of a bottle.
It might have been too much.
Just picture watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
This is probably one of those cry- for- help things.
So you' re staying in tonight, then?
Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death?
Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Narrator:
I' d been living here for 2 months, and Tyler' s door was never closed.
[Footsteps On Stairs]
You won' t believe this dream I had last night.
Yeah, I can hardly believe anything about last night.
[Chuckles]
What -- What are you doing here?
What?
This is my house.
What are you doing in my house?
Fuck you.
Ohh...
Oh, you got some fucked- up friends, I' m tellin 'you.
[Chuckling]
Limber, though... silly coos.
So, I come in last night.
Guess who' s on the other end.
I already knew the story before he told it to me.
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Do you think it' il live up to its name?
Or will it just be a death... hairball?
[Coughs]
9... 8...
Marla:
5... 4... 3 -- Oh, hang on.
You got here fast.
Did I call you?
Huh?
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.
[Rattling]
Oh, don' t worry.
[Siren]
Oh, fuck.
Somebody called the cops.
Hey, where' s 513?
End of the hall.
You know, the girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl.
She' s lost faith in herself.
Miss Singer!
She' s a monster.
You have every reason to live!
She' s infectious human waste!
Miss Singer!
Good luck trying to save her!
If I fall asleep, I' m done for.
You' re gonna have to keep me up... all... night.
Un- fucking- believable.
He was obviously able to handle it.
You fucked her.
No, I didn' t.
Never?
You' re not into her, are you?
God, not at all.
I am Jack' s raging bile duct.
Are you sure?
You can tell me.
Believe me, I' m sure.
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains.
That' s good, 'cause she' s a predator posing as a house pet.
I ain' t never heard.
My God.
I haven' t been fucked like that since grade school.
Narrator:
The night before last, he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.
She needs a fucking case worker.
She needs a wash.
And she' s in love with sport fuckin '.
She invaded my support groups.
Now she' d invaded my home.
Hey, hey.
Can' t have you talking to her about me.
Why would I talk to her --
You say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or to anybody, we' re done.
Now, promise me.
OK.
You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise.
I just said I promise.
That' s 3 times you promised.
If only I had wasted a couple of minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die, none of this would' ve happened.
Unhh!
Harder!
Aah!
[Tyler And Marla Shouting Passionately]
I could' ve moved to another room... on the third floor, where I might not have heard them.
But I didn' t.
[Marla Moaning With Pleasure]
Ohh!
- Aah!
What are you doin '? just goin' to bed.
[Marla Moans]
Uhh... oh!
[Clattering]
No.
I found the cigarettes.
Who are you talking to?
I became the calm little center of the world.
I was the Zen master.
Ohh!
I wrote little haiku poems.
I e- mailed them to everyone.
Is that your blood?
Some of it, yeah.
[Snickers]
Take the rest of the day off.
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.
Get yourself together.
I got right in everyone' s hostile little face.
Yes, these are bruises from fighting.
Yes, I' m comfortable with that.
I... am enlightened.
You give up the condo life... give up all your flaming worldly possessions... go live in a dilapidated house in a toxic waste part of town... and you have to come home to this.
Ohh!
[Ring]
This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.
We have some new information about the incident at your former condo.
I don' t know if you' re aware, but it seems that someone sprayed freon into your front door lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
No, I wasn' t aware of that at all.
I am Jack' s cold sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
Very strange.
Dynamite?
left a residue of ammonium oxylate potassium chloride.
Do you know what this means?
What does it mean?
It means it was homemade.
This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir.
See, whoever set this homemade dynamite could' ve blown out your pilot light days before the actual explosion.
The gas was just the detonator.
Who would go and do such a thing?
I' il ask the questions.
Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property has realigned my perception.
Detective:
Are you there?
No, I am listening.
It' s a little hard to know what to make of all this.
Have you recently made enemies with anyone who might have access to homemade dynamite?
- Reject the basic assumption of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.
Son, this is serious.
Yes, I know it' s serious.
I mean that.
Yes, it' s very serious.
Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me.
That condo was my life.
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.
That was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed.
It was me!
I' d like to thank the Academy.
Is this not a good time for you? just tell him you fuckin 'did it.
Tell him you blew it all up.
That' s what he wants to hear.
Wait.
Are you saying that I' m a suspect?
No, no.
I may need to talk to you a little further, so how about you just lettin 'me know if you' re gonna leave town?
OK?
OK.
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
My parents pulled this exact same act for years.
The condom is the glass slipper of our generation.
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
You... dance all night.
Then you throw it away.
Not the stranger.
What?
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1. 00.
It was worth every penny.
It' s a bridesmaid' s dress.
Someone loved it... intensely for one day... then tossed it.
Like a Christmas tree... so special... then... bam... it' s on the side of the road... tinsel still clinging to it...
like a sex crime victim... underwear inside out... bound with electrical tape.
Well, then it suits you.
You can borrow it sometime.
Get rid of her.
Why can' t you get rid of her?
Don' t mention me.
I' m 6 years old again, passing messages between parents.
I really think it' s time you got out of here.
Not that we don' t love your little visits.
You are such a nut case.
I can' t even begin to keep up.
Gotta get off
Thanks.
[Continues Singing, Indistinctly]
[Chuckling]
You kids.
Why do you still waste time with her?
I' il say this about Marla -- at least she' s tryin 'to hit bottom.
What, and I' m not?
Stickin 'feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.
What are we doin 'tonight?
- Yeah.
Really.
To make soap, first we render fat.
The salt balance has to be just right, so the best fat for making soap comes from humans.
What is this place?
A liposuction clinic.
Pay dirt.
The richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Come on.
Oh, God!
Oh!
As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface.
Like in Boy Scouts.
I can imagine you as a Boy Scout.
Keep stirrin '.
Once the tallow hardens, we skim off a layer of glycerin.
If you were to add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.
If you were then to add sodium nitrate and a dash of sawdust, you got dynamite.
Yeah, with enough soap, we could blow up just about anything.
Tyler was full of useful information.
Now, ancient peoples found that clothes got cleaner when they washed them at a certain point in the river.
- You know why?
Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river.
Bodies burned.
Water seeped into the wood and ashes to create lye.
This is lye, the crucial ingredient.
Once it mixed with the melted fat of bodies, a thick, white, soapy discharge crept into the river.
May I see your hand, please?
What is this?
This... is chemical burn.
Uh -- Aah!
It' il hurt more than you' ve ever been burned, and you will have a scar.
If meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
Don' t shove to center.
No, no!
The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes,
like the first monkey shot into space.
Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothin '.
I tried not to think of the the words "sear" or "flesh."
This is your burning hand.
I' m going to my cave and find my power animal.
No!
Don' t deal with it the way those dead people do!
Come on!
OK!
Please!
What you' re feeling is premature enlightenment.
This is the greatest moment of your life, man, and you' re off somewhere --
Our fathers were our models for God.
If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God?
No, no.
You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you,
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don' t need Him.
We don' t!
Fuck redemption.
We are God' s unwanted children?
So be it!
[Shouting Incomprehensibly]
Listen!
You can run water over your hand to make it worse, or -- look at me -- or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
Please let me have some!
First you have to give up.
First you have to know, not fear, know that someday you' re gonna die.
You don' t know how this feels!
It' s only after we' ve lost everything that we' re free to do anything.
OK.
Congratulations.
You' re one step closer to hitting bottom.
Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar.
God knows what they charged.
This is the best soap.
It was beautiful.
We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.
He was wearing his yellow tie.
I didn' t even wear a tie to work anymore.
"The first rule of Fight Club is you don' t talk about Fight Club"?
I' m half asleep again.
I must' ve left the original in the copy machine.
"The second rule of Fight Club --" Is this yours?
Huh?
Make a managerial decision.
You find this.
What would you do?
I' d be very, very careful who you talk to about that.
Because the person who wrote that... is dangerous.
And this buttoned- down, Oxford- cloth psycho might just snap and then stalk from office to office with an Armilade AR- 10 carbine gas- powered semi- automatic weapon, pumping round after round into colleagues and coworkers.
This might be someone you' ve known for years... someone very... very... close to you.
Tyler' s words coming out of my mouth.
And I used to be such a nice guy.
Maybe you shouldn' t bring me every little piece of trash you happen to pick up.
Liability.
My tit' s gonna rot off.
I need to take this.
What' re you talking about?
I need you to check and see if there' s a lump in my breast.
Go to a hospital.
I can' t afford to throw money away on a doctor.
I don' t know about this, Marla.
Please?
She didn' t call Tyler.
I' m neutral in her book.
That' s nice.
Hannaburr, Mrs. Raines?
Who are they... exactly?
Tragically, they' re dead.
I' m alive, and I' m in poverty.
You want any?
No.
I got one for you.
Thanks for the thought.
What happened to your hand?
Uh... nothin '.
Right there.
Uhh.
Feel anything?
No.
Well, make sure.
Ok, I' m -- I' m pretty sure.
Nothing.
Well, that' s a relief.
Thank you.
Uh, um... no problem.
I wish I could return the favor.
There' s not a lot of breast cancer in the men in my family.
Could check your prostate.
I think I' m OK.
Well, thanks, anyway.
Are we done?
Yeah, we' re done.
See you... around.
Cornelius?
Cornelius!
It' s me...
Bob!
Bob.
We all thought you were dead.
No, no.
Still here.
[Chuckles]
Better than I' ve ever been in my whole life.
You still remaining men together?
No, no.
Really.
What is it?
Well... first rule is...
I' m not supposed to talk about it.
Bob.
Bob.
I' m a member.
Look at my face, Bob.
That' s fuckin '-- That' s fuckin' great.
I' ve never seen you there.
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I go Saturday.
Congratulations.
Hey, to both of us, right?
Well, uh, yeah, actually.
I hear all kinds of things.
And he sleeps only one hour a night.
He' s a great man.
Do you know about Tyler Durden?
[Spectators Shouting And Hollering]
I didn' t hurt you, did I?
Actually, you did.
Thank you for this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Bob.
Bob.
This was mine and Tyler' s gift... our gift to the world.
I see a lot of new faces.
- Ha ha!
Shut up!
Which means a lot of you have been breaking the first 2 rules of Fight Club.
Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who' ve ever lived.
I see all this potential.
And I see squandering.
God damn it.
An entire generation pumping gas... waiting tables... slaves with white collars.
Advertising has its taste in cars and clothes... working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don' t need.
We' re the middle children of history, man.
No purpose or place.
We have no Great War... no Great Depression.
Our Great War' s a spiritual war.
Our Great Depression is our lives.
We' ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we' d all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars.
But we won' t.
We' re slowly learning that fact.
And we' re very, very pissed off.
First rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about --
Who are you?
Who am I?
Yeah.
There' s a sign in the front that says "Lou' s Tavern."
I' m fuckin 'Lou.
Who the fuck are you?
Tyler Durden.
Who told you motherfuckers that you could use my place?
Irvin?
Irvin' s at home with a broken collarbone.
He don' t own this place.
I do.
How much money is he gettin 'for this?
There is no money.
- Really.
- Free to all.
It is, actually.
Look, stupid fuck...
Hey.
You should join our club.
Did you hear what I just said?
You and your friend.
Oomp!
Uhh!
No, I didn' t quite catch that, Lou.
Ohhh...
Still not gettin 'it.
I got it.
I got it.
Shit, I lost it.
Ooh!
All of you!
Everybody back.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Aw, Lou...
Come on, man.
We really like this place.
Ohh!
Ohhh...
- That' s right, Lou, get it -- - Shut the fuck up!
Oh, yeah!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ho ho, ho!
Ha ha ha ha -- Ohh!
Fuckin 'guys are loony, I' m tellin' ya.
Unbelievable.
- Oh, my God!
- Ha ha ha!
Ha ha!
Please let us keep it, Lou!
Please, Lou!
Fuckin 'use the basement!
I want your word, Lou!
I want your word!
On my mother' s honor.
Aaahhh!
Thanks, Lou.
You, too, big guy.
See you next week.
This week... each one of you... has a homework assignment.
You' re gonna start a fight with a total stranger.
And you' re gonna lose.
Excellent choice, sir.
Watch out, jackass!
Come on!
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.
Son of a bitch!
Most people... normal people... do just about anything to avoid a fight.
Excuse me.
Like that?
That' s not necessary.
Dave!
Go call 911!
Aaaahhh!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Sorry.
We need to talk.
[Door Closes]
Where to begin?
With your constant absenteeism?
With your unpresentable appearance?
You' re up for review.
I am Jack' s... complete lack of surprise.
You' re the Department of Transportation.
Someone informs you that this company installs front seat mounting brackets that never pass collision tests... brake linings that fail after a thousand miles, and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive.
What then?
Are you threatening me?
No...
You' re fired.
I have a better solution.
You keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant.
And in exchange for my salary, my job will be never to tell people these things that I know.
I can do this job from home.
Who -- Who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit?
Security?
I am jack' s smirking revenge.
Ahh... ahh...
What the hell are you doing?
Ohh... that hurt.
Why would you do that?
Oh, my God.
Please stop!
[Making Strangulation Sounds]
What are you doing?
Oh, God, no!
Please!
For some reason, I thought of my first fight with Tyler.
No!
Under and behind and inside, everything this man took for granted... something horrible had been growing.
Now, look.
Give me the paychecks like I asked, and you won' t ever see me again.
And right then, at our most excellent moment together...
Oh... thank God.
Telephone, computer, fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks, and 48 airline flight coupons.
We now had corporate sponsorship.
This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.
[Crowd Cheering]
Now nobody was the center of Fight Club except the 2 men fighting.
The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.
Tyler was now involved in a class- action lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel over the urine content of their soup.
I am Jack' s wasted life.
There you are, sir.
Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.
Did you know there' s a Fight Club up in Delaware City?
Yeah, I heard.
There' s one in Penn' s Grove, too.
Bob even found one up in Newcastle.
Did you start that one?
I thought you did.
Nah.
Pff!.
Stop for a second.
Hey, what are we doing?
Turn around.
What are we doing?
Homework assignment.
Human sacrifice.
Hey, is that a gun?
Please.
Please tell me that' s not a gun.
It' s a gun.
Meet me in the back.
Hey, don' t fuck around.
Meet me in the back.
On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
What are you doing?
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.
Raymond K. Hessel, 1320 Southeast Banning, apartment A.
Small, cramped basement apartment, Raymond?
How did you know?
letters instead of numbers.
Raymond... you' re going to die.
Oh, my God, no...
Is that your mom and dad?
Mom and dad are going to have to call up kindly Dr. So- And- So to pick up your dental records.
You want to know why?
Because there' s going to be nothing left of your face.
- [Crying]
An expired community college student I. D.
What' d you study, Raymond?
S- S- S- Stuff.
Stuff?
Were the midterms hard?
I asked you what you studied.
Biology, mostly.
Why?
I -- I don' t know.
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
The question, Raymond, was what did you want to be?
Answer him, Raymond!
Jesus!
Veterinarian!
Veterinarian!
Animals.
Yeah, animal s- s- s --
Yeah, I got that.
That means you have to get more schooling.
Too much school.
Would you rather be dead?
No...
Would you rather die, here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store?
No...
I' m keeping your license.
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.
If you' re not on your way to becoming a veterinarian in 6 weeks, you will be dead.
[Whimpering]
Now run on home.
Run, Forrest, run!
I feel ill.
Imagine how he feels.
Come on, this isn' t funny!
What the fuck was the point of that?
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessel' s life.
Narrator:
You had to give it to him.
Come on.
He had a plan.
And it started to make sense in a Tyler sort of way.
No fear.
No distractions.
The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.
You' re not your job.
You' re not how much money you have in the bank.
You' re not the car you drive.
You' re not the contents of your wallet.
You' re not your fuckin 'khakis.
You' re the all- singing, all- dancing crap of the world.
I' il be out of your way in a sec.
You don' t have to go.
Whatever.
No, I mean, uh...
It' s OK.
Are you still going to groups?
Yeah.
Chloe' s dead.
Ah, Chloe.
When did that happen?
Do you care?
I don' t know.
I haven' t thought about it in a while.
Yeah, well...
I think it was a smart move on her part.
Hey, listen, uh... what are you getting out of all this?
What?
I mean, all this.
Why do you keep...
Is this making you happy?
Yeah, well, sometimes.
I don' t know.
I don' t understand.
Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person?
What is that?
Well, what do you get out of it?
No -- It' s -- It' s not the same thing at all.
It' s totally different with us.
We' re -- We' re --
Us?
What do you mean by "us"?
I' m sorry, do you hear this?
Hear what?
You' re not hearing all that noise? just -- Hold on a second.
What were you saying?
I want to talk about this.
No.
What?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor -- what was going on there?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I don' t think so.
Come on, what do you want?
- No.
What?
Look at me.
What is that?
It' s nothing.
Don' t worry about it.
Who did this?
A person.
Guy or girl?
What do you care if it' s a guy or a girl?
This is none of your business.
You' re afraid to say it.
I am not afraid to say.
Let me go.
No!
Talk to me.
Leave me alone.
This conversation...
This conversation... is over. is over.
I just can' t win with you, can I?
Hey, this is getting a little old.
[Doorbell]
What is -- What is all this?
What do you think?
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
Too young.
Sorry.
What' s all that?
If the applicant is young, tell him he' s too young.
Old, too old.
Applicant?
If the applicant then waits for 3 days without food, shelter or encouragement, he may then enter and begin his training.
Training for what?
You think this is a game?
End of story.
Get the fuck out of here.
Bad news, friend.
It' s not gonna happen.
I' m sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
It' s not the end of the world. just go away.
Go.
You' re trespassing, and I will have to call the police.
Don' t you look at me.
You' re never getting in this fucking house.
Never.
Now get the fuck off the porch.
Get off the porch!
Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.
I' m gonna go inside and I' m gonna get a shovel.
Sir.
2 pair of black pants?
Yes, sir.
One pair of black boots?
Sir.
2 pair of black socks?
One black jacket?
Sir. $300 personal burial money?
Yes, sir.
All right.
You' re too old, fat man.
Your tits are too big.
Bob.
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
Space monkey.
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.
You are too fucking old, fatty!
And you.
You' re too fucking... blond!
Get out of here, the both of you!
Narrator:
Listen up, maggots.
You are not special.
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else.
Tyler built himself an army.
We are the all- singing, all- dancing crap of the world.
We are all part of the same compost heap.
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?
To what purpose?
For what greater good?
In Tyler we trusted.
No, when he was like, "You are not your job," I was like...
Hey, what' s all this?
[Laughing]
OK!
Go on in and celebrate.
What are we celebrating?
Go on.
[TV Playing]
Hey.
Let me get that for you.
Investigators are on the scene right now.
Police Commissioner Jacobs has just arrived.
Commissioner, Commissioner, could you please tell us what you think has happened here?
We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism around the city somehow related to underground boxing clubs.
We' il be coordinating a rigorous investigation.
That was Police Commissioner Jacobs, who just arrived on the scene here of a 4- alarm fire that broke out about an hour ago.
Live from the Parker Morris Building,
Back to you in the studio.
- [Laughter]
- Ha ha ha ha!
Holy shit.
Yeah!
What the fuck did you guys do?
[Laughing]
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir.
The victory in the war against crime will not come overnight.
It will take dedication and commitment, and most of all, cooperation.
The streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city.
However, this is only the beginning.
These are the first steps in a long journey.
That is why we have created Project Hope...
Project Hope will be a joint effort between the police and community leaders.
It will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime.
[Applause]
Haahhhh!
Wrap it around the top of his hacky sack, Bob.
His balls are ice cold.
Hi.
You' re gonna call off your rigorous investigation.
You' re gonna publicly state that there is no underground group, or... these guys are gonna take your balls.
They' re gonna send one to the New York Times, one to the L. A. Times press release style.
Look... the people you are after are the people you depend on.
We connect your calls.
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.
Do not fuck with us.
[Muffled Screaming]
Fooled ya.
[Dialogue Drowned Out By Noise]
Let' s go.
I am Jack' s inflamed sense of rejection.
Hey!
Yeah!
[Shouting]
I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldn' t screw to save its species.
I' d never see.
I wanted to breathe smoke.
Where' d you go, psycho boy?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
Get him to a fuckin 'hospital.
Yeah.
Don' t worry, Mr. Durden.
Airport parking, long term.
After you, Mr. Durden.
After you.
Something on your mind, dear?
No.
Why wasn' t I told about Project Mayhem?
[Together]
First rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions.
Why didn' t you include me in the beginning?
Fight Club was the beginning.
Now it' s moved out of the basement, it' s called Project Mayhem.
Do you remember that?
It' s as much mine as it is yours, you know.
Yeah.
You' re missing the point.
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.
Fuck that.
You should' ve told me.
Hey, Tyler!
[Horn Honking]
Goddamn it, Tyler!
Statement of purpose?
Should I e- mail you?
Should I put this on your action item list?
You decide your own level of involvement!
I want to know certain things first.
The first rule of Project Mayhem --
Shut up!
Fuck what you know.
That' s your problem.
Forget about what you think you know about life, about friendship, and especially about you and me.
What...
What are you doing?
Guys, what do you wish you' d done before you die?
Build a house.
And you?
I don' t know.
Get in the right lane.
I have to know the answer to this question.
If you were to die right now, how would you feel about your life?
I don' t know!
I wouldn' t feel anything good about my life.
Is that what you want to hear me say?
- Come on!
- [Honking]
- Stop fucking around!
Tyler!
Jesus Christ!
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!
Fuck you!
Fuck Fight Club.
I' m sick of all your shit.
OK.
Quit screwing around.
Take the wheel.
Look at you.
Take the wheel!
Look at you!
You' re fuckin 'pathetic!
Why?
What are you talking about?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
What?
It' s not a goddamn seminar.
Stop trying to control everything and just let go.
Let go!
All right.
Fine.
Fine.
I' d never been in a car accident.
This must have been what all those people felt like before I filed them as statistics in my reports.
Goddamn.
Ha ha ha ha ha hahh!
We just had a near- life experience.
In the world I see, you' re stalking elk through the damp canyon forest, around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
You' il wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life.
You' il climb the vines that wrap the Sears Tower.
laying strips of venison on the empty carpool lane of some abandoned superhighway.
Feel better, champ.
[Door Closes]
Narrator:
Tyler was gone.
Was I asleep?
Had I slept?
You are not a beautiful unique snowflake, do you understand me?
Narrator:
The house had become a living thing, wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.
So many people moving, the house moved.
Planet Tyler.
I had to hug the walls.
Trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys.
You can' t be smoking in here.
Do you know how much ether we have in this fucking house?
Cooking, working, and sleeping in teams.
Hang on a second.
It' s under control, sir.
Where is Tyler?
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not --
Right, uh...
I' m all alone.
My father dumped me.
Tyler dumped me.
I am Jack' s broken heart.
What comes next in Project Mayhem, only Tyler knows.
The second rule is you do not ask questions.
Get the fuck away from me.
Get the fuck away from me!
Who are all these people?
Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He' s not here.
What?
Tyler isn' t here.
Tyler went away.
Tyler' s gone.
[Shouting]
Gunshot wounds comin 'through!
Clear some fucking room!
What happened?!
What happened?!
We were supposed to kill 2 birds with one stone.
Destroy a piece of corporate art...
Operation Latté Thunder, go.
and trash a franchise coffee bar.
We had it all worked out, sir.
It went smooth until...
Police!
Freeze!
Until what?
They shot him in the head.
Those fuckin 'pigs!
- Ohh!
- Son of a --
Those motherfuckers!
You morons.
You' re running around in ski masks, trying to blow things up.
What did you think was gonna happen?!
OK, quick, we gotta get rid of the evidence.
What?
Take him to the garden and bury him.
Come on, people!
Let' s go!
Hey, get the fuck off!.
What are you talking about?
This isn' t a fucking piece of evidence, this is a person!
He' s a friend of mine, and you' re not gonna bury him in the fucking garden.
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.
This is Bob.
But sir, in -- in Project Mayhem we have no names.
And it' s Robert Paulson, OK?
Robert Paulson?
He' s a man and he' s dead now because of us, all right?
I understand.
In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a name.
His name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson.
Come on, guys, please, stop it.
His name is Robert Paulson.
Shut up!
This is all over with!
His name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson.
[Telephone Rings]
No, this is Detective Stern at the Arson Unit.
I need to see you in my office --
I went to all the cities on Tyler' s used ticket stubs, barhopping.
I didn' t know how or why, but I could look at 50 different bars and somehow I just knew.
I' m looking for Tyler Durden.
It' s very important that I talk to him.
Sir.
I knew a Fight Club was close.
Hey!
Taxi!
Look at my face.
I' m a member.
Now, I just need to know if you' ve seen Tyler.
I' m not exposed to... speak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want at this juncture, be able.
You' re a moron.
I' m afraid I' m gonna have to ask you to leave.
Setting up franchises all over the country.
Was I asleep?
Had I slept?
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler' s?
We' ve just heard the stories.
What kind of stories?
Like, nobody knows what he looks like.
He has facial reconstructive surgery every 3 years.
That' s the stupidest thing I' ve ever heard.
Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
Is Mr. Durden building an army?
I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.
I felt I' d already been there.
It was like following an invisible man.
The smell of dried blood, dirty, bare footprints circling each other, that aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.
The feel of a floor still warm from the fight the night before.
I was always just one step behind Tyler.
His name is Robert Paulson.
Welcome back, sir.
How have you been?
Do you know me?
Is this a test, sir?
No, this is not a test.
You were in here last Thursday.
You were standing exactly where you are now, asking how good security is.
It' s tight as a drum, sir.
Who do you think I am?
Are you sure this isn' t a test?
No, this is not a test.
You' re Mr. Durden.
You' re the one who gave me this.
Please return your seat backs to their full, upright and locked position.
[Telephone Rings]
[Rings]
Marla, it' s me.
Have we ever done it?
Done what?
Have we ever had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Is it stupid because the answer' s yes, or because the answer' s no?
Is this a trick?
No, Marla, I need to know --
You mean you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
We did make love.
Is that what you' re calling it? just answer the question,
Marla, please!
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.
You show me a sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole.
Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
We have just lost cabin pressure.
What is wrong with you?
What did you call me?
Tyler Durden.
Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.
What' s going on?
I' m coming over.
No, wait, Marla, I' m not there --
You broke your promise.
Jesus, Tyler.
You fuckin 'talked to her about me.
Tyler, what the fuck is going on here?
I asked you for one thing, one simple thing.
Why do people think that I' m you?
Answer me!
Sit.
Now answer me.
Why do people think that I' m you?
I think you know.
No, I don' t.
Yes, you do.
Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me?
I...
You got it.
No.
Do not fuck with us.
Say it.
Because...
Say it.
Because we' re the same person.
That' s right.
We are the all- singing, all dancing --
I don' t understand this.
You were looking for a way to change your life.
You could not do this on your own.
All the ways you wish you could be, that' s me.
I fuck like you wanna fuck,
I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not.
Oh, no.
Tyler went away.
- Tyler' s gone.
This is impossible.
- No.
People do it every day.
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they' d like to be.
They don' t have the courage you have, to just run with it.
Naturally, you' re still wrestling with it, so sometimes you' re still you.
We should do this again sometime.
Other times, you imagine yourself watching me.
If this is your first night at Fight Club, you have to fight.
Tyler Durden.
You are not your job, or how much money you have in the bank!
No, you have a house.
Rented in your name.
You have jobs, you have a whole life.
You have night jobs because you can' t sleep.
Or you stay up and make soap.
Marla -- You' re fucking Marla, Tyler.
But it' s all the same to her.
Oh, my God.
Now you see our dilemma.
She knows too much.
I think we' re going to have to talk about how this might compromise our goals.
Wh -- What are you saying?
This is -- This is bullshit.
This is bullshit.
I' m not listening to this.
You are insane.
No, you' re insane.
And we simply do not have time for this crap.
It' s called a changeover.
The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Woman:
Sir!
Are you checking out?
Yeah, uh, b- bill me.
I need you to initial this list of phone calls, please.
When were these made?
It says right there, sir, between 2: 00 and 3: 30 this morning.
Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?
Is anybody here?
Déjà vu all over again.
Yeah, with enough soap, we could blow up just about anything.
Oh, my God.
1888.
I' m sorry, who am I calling?
This is Maintenance.
Hello?
Yes.
Can I help you?
Hello?
Uh, I need to talk to your supervisor right away.
Speaking.
OK, listen to me.
You have got --
It' s under control, sir.
Excuse me?
Don' t worry about us, sir.
We' re solid.
2160.
Marla!
Marla!
Hey -- Fuck!
Wait, I gotta talk to you!
Marla, Marla!
Your whacked- out bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!
They were burning their fingertips with lye, the stink was unbelievable.
Look -- Look, listen, it' s gonna take a tremendous act of faith on your part, but you' ve got to hear me out.
Oh, here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
A little more faith than that.
No, listen, I don' t want to hear anything you have to say.
You have every right to be...
Um, I' il just have a coffee, thanks.
Sir, anything you order is free of charge, sir.
Why is it free of charge?
Don' t -- Don' t ask.
Whatever.
I' il have the clam chowder, the fried chicken with the baked potato with everything, and a chocolate chiffon pie.
Clean food, please.
In that case, sir, may I advise against the lady eating the clam chowder?
No clam chowder, thank you.
You' ve got about 30 seconds.
Marla, I know that I' ve been acting very, very strange.
like there' s 2 sides to me -- 2 sides?
You' re Dr. Jekyil and Mr. Jackass.
I' ve come to realize something very, very important.
What?
The full extent of our relationship wasn' t really clear to me up until now, for reasons I' m not going to go into, but the important thing is, I know that I haven' t been treating you so nice.
Yeah, whatever.
15 seconds, please, please.
15 seconds, don' t open your mouth.
I' m trying to tell you that I' m sorry.
Because what I' ve come to realize is that I really like you, Marla.
You do?
I really do.
I care about you and I don' t want anything bad to happen to you because of me.
Marla, your life is in danger.
What?
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city and just go camping or something.
You' re an insane person.
No, no, I' ve involved you in something terrible that' s about to happen.
No.
Shut up, shut up!
I really tried.
I know you did.
There are things about you I like.
You' re smart, you' re funny, you' re spectacular in bed.
But you' re intolerable.
You have very serious emotional problems.
Deep- seated problems for which you should seek professional help.
I know, and I' m sorry.
Yeah, you' re sorry, I' m sorry, everyone' s sorry.
But...
I can' t do this anymore.
I can' t.
And I won' t.
I' m gone.
You can' t leave, Marla, you' re not safe!
No!
Marla, I' m trying to protect you.
I don' t ever want to see you again!
That' s fine, if that' s what it takes...
Wait right here.
- [Honking]
Shut up!
Take this money and get on this bus.
And I promise you
- [Honks]
Please get on the bus.
Please get on the bus!
Why are you doing this?
Because they think you' re some kind of a threat.
I -- I can' t explain it right now, just trust me.
If I see where you' re going, you will not be safe.
I consider it asshole tax.
That' s fine.
Remember, stay out of major cities for at least a couple of days, OK?
Tyler.
You' re the worst thing that ever happened to me.
Hello.
I need you to arrest me.
I am the leader of a terrorist organization responsible for numerous acts of vandalism, and assault all over this city.
... in the metropolitan area, with probably a couple hundred members.
Chapters have sprung up in 5 or 6 other major cities already.
This is a tightly regimented organization, with many cells capable of operating completely independent of central leadership.
Look, look, go to that house, OK?
1537 Paper Street.
That' s our headquarters.
In the back, buried in the garden, you' il find the body of Robert Paulson.
In the basement, you' re gonna find some bathtubs that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
I believe the plan is to blow up the headquarters of these credit card companies, and the T. R. W. building.
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?
If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero.
It' il create total chaos.
Keep him talking.
I need to make a phone call.
I really admire what you' re doing.
What?
You' re a brave man to order this.
You' re a genius, sir.
You said, if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem -- even you -- we gotta get his balls.
It' s useless to fight.
Mr. Durden.
It' il set quite an example.
You' re making a big mistake, fellas.
You said you' d say that.
I' m not Tyler Durden!
You told us you' d say that, too.
All right, I am Tyler Durden.
I' m giving you a direct order.
We are aborting this mission, right now.
You said you would definitely say that.
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You' re police officers!
Somebody timing this?
Keep your mouth shut!
Shit.
Hey, you know, some of this information checks out.
Let' s go over to that house on Paper Street.
Hey!
I got him.
Sir, we have to do this, sir.
Stop fighting.
Where' s the rubber band?
Get away from me!
Drop that fucking knife!
Back up.
Face down on the floor, both of you, right now!
Get down on the floor!
First person comes out this fucking door gets a -- gets a lead salad, you understand?
[Horns Blaring]
Get away!
Get away!
I ran.
I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.
Then I ran some more.
What the fuck are you doing?
Running around in your underpants.
Man, you look like a crazy person.
No, I' m onto you.
I know what' s going on here.
Well come on, then.
[Grunting]
It' il be like pay- per- view.
Oh, Christ.
I' m stopping this.
Why?
Greatest thing you' ve ever done, man.
No, I can' t let this happen.
You know there are 10 other bombs in 10 other buildings.
God damn it, since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
The buildings are empty.
Security and maintenance, all our people.
We' re not killing anyone, man, we' re setting 'em free.
They shot him in the head.
You wanna make an omelet, you gotta break some eggs.
No, I' m not listening to you.
You' re not even there.
Wouldn' t do that.
Not unless I knew which wires were what.
If you know, then I know.
Or... maybe I knew you' d know, so I spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones.
You think?
Oh, heavens no, not the green one.
Pull any one but the green one.
I asked you not to do that!
Tyler, get away from the van.
Tyler, I' m not kidding!
Get away from the van!
God damn it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
OK, you are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
Look, Tyler, Tyler!
Aw, come on.
Don' t go.
What?!
3 minutes.
This is it.
The beginning.
Ground zero.
I think this is about where we came in.
Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
I' m sorry?
I still can' t think of anything.
Ah, flashback humor.
It' s getting exciting now.
2 and 1/ 2.
Think of everything we' ve accomplished, man.
Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history.
One step closer to economic equilibrium.
Why is she here?
Tying up loose ends.
Put me down, you bald- headed fucks!
I' m begging you, please don' t do this.
I' m not doing this.
We are doing this.
This is what we want.
No, I don' t want this.
Right, except you is meaningless now.
We have to forget about you.
Jesus, you' re a voice in my head.
You' re a voice in mine.
You' re a fucking hallucination, why can' t I get rid of you?
You need me.
No, I don' t, I really don' t anymore.
Hey, you created me.
I didn' t create some loser alter ego to make myself feel better.
Take some responsibility.
I do.
I am responsible for all of it, and I accept that.
So please, I' m begging you, please call this off.
Have I ever let us down?
How far have you come because of me?
I will bring us through this.
I will carry you, kicking and screaming, and in the end, you will thank me.
Tyler.
Tyler, I' m grateful to you for everything that you' ve done for me.
But this is too much.
I don' t want this.
What do you want?!
Want to go back to the shit job, fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
Fuck you.
I won' t do it.
Oh, God, this can' t be happening.
It' s already done, so shut up.
60 seconds.
Can you see alright?
I can figure this out.
I can figure this out, this isn' t even real.
You' re not real, that gun isn' t --
That gun isn' t even in your hand.
The gun' s in my hand.
Doesn' t change a thing.
Why do you want to put a gun to your head?
Not my head, Tyler.
Our head.
Interesting.
Where are you going with this, IKEA boy?
Hey, it' s you and me.
Friends.
Tyler...
I want you to really listen to me.
OK.
My eyes are open.
What' s that smell?
[Elevator Bell Dings]
Where is everybody?
I don' t know, what' s goin 'on?
Mr. Durden!
Oh, my God.
Are you, uh...
Are you alright, sir?
You look terrible, sir.
What happened?
Oh, nothing.
It' s no problem.
Oh, no, no, sir, he' s not kidding.
You look really awful.
You need medical assistance.
Look, I' m fine.
Everything' s fine.
[Marla Shouting]
Let -- Let her go.
Christ almighty!
You!
Hi, Marla.
Leave her with me, get your stuff,
Are you sure?
Yes, I' m sure.
You fucker!
What kind of sick fucking game are you playing now, putting me on a fucking bu --
Oh, my God, your face!
Yeah, I know.
What happened?
Don' t ask.
You' re shot.
Yes, I' m shot.
Oh, my God.
I can' t believe he' s standing.
One tough motherfucker.
Who did this?
I did, actually.
Find some gauze.
You shot yourself?
Yes, but it' s OK.
Marla, look at me.
I' m really OK.
Trust me.
Everything' s gonna be fine.
You met me at a very strange time in my life.
And your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head' il collapse
If there' s nothing in it
And you' il ask yourself
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimming
I was swimming in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
When they told me east is west
Trying to talk to me, coy koi
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimming
With your feet on the air
And your head on the ground
Your head' il collapse if there' s nothing in it
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimming

It is time.
You said something about resurection...
The Power to bring back a dead soul into the body again.
It can only be done in the Forrest of Resurection...
What now?
This is the Forrest of Resurection.
I don' t understand.
With his power he brings back the dead.
Resurection?
I have killed them.
That' s because off...
Hwo is this?
Another guy.
Is she also dead?
No, she is alive.
What are you?
Don' t kill her!
I only wanted to help.
Help?
I never lose.
What the hell...?
Stop.
Ha?
They are here...
What?
I can smell...
Smell?
Ich sniff...
Like a trained Dog.
Sniff?
Like a trained dog?
I sniff...
Look.
A jailwalker.
Here' s your deathguarantee!
Move!
Die!
Shit...
This way...
No.
Wait!
You' re not...
You' re not...
Let me talk, bitch!
Talk.
You' re not already a monster, are you?
You' re neither.
Stop!
I was brought here...
Bitch!!!
Looks like we are the only survivers.
...
Baby.
What' s happening here?
I don' t know, let' s move off.
With you?
Common, i know this place!
Okay.
One wrong move and you' re dead.
Okay.
You have changed.
Stand up.
Don' t you remember?
Remember?
What?
Me...
I never met you before.
Then why did you help me in the first place?
I did' t want to help
You followed me... and saved me.
What did you mean with destiny?
I will tell you.
You...
Good...
You are still alive.
So, you are the reason for all this.
I knew you would survive.
I don' t know you.
Piss off.
Your soul can...
Whatever.
What do you want?
The time has come.
Give me the girl and come with me.
No.
What are you talking about?
He isn' t really remembering anything?
Leave us alone.
No, i have waited...
What do you want?
He wants to see me dead.
What?
Common, i' il give you a certan power.
Let' s talk about us.
What' s happening?
Her blood will give me the power.
This is the Forrest of Resurection.
The Bridge.
The gate to the other side.
Where the dead become zombies...
That' s all.
The real Power of this place is much greater.
There are two keys, to open the gate to the other side.
One is a human sacrificial, the other one is the blood of resurection.
I have fould them...
500 Years agao.
You' re completly nuts.
Come with me.
I' il show you the Power of the Darkness.
Don' t tell me what i have to do!
Just listen to me.
You can' t kill me.
Shut up.
You have made me 500 years waiting for the reincarnation of the girl.
But i' il forgive you.
I have waited for her to be born again and rise.
Today the forrest and her blood will open the gate to the other side.
I have found you in jail, i never expected you to spend your life there.
Why did you want me?
I' il like you a lot more as a criminal.
You should be a man of honor and laws.
You really did let me suffer.
But you have changed.
That' s why i brought you here.
Don' t turn your back at me this time.
Fuck off...
You instinkt has changed you.
Till now you have killed 43 people.
little brother.
Brother?
Do you feel the power of this place?
Humans are born... they live...
and die.
The Darkness after death is reality...
Common, i' il guide you.
Let your dark instinkt come over you.
I would rather choose to die, then live with you.
Well, then die.
Like it' s planned.
Tale the girl.
Don' t you dare touching me.
What?
Kill me.
Still a bitch.
He can' t save you, and he never will.
You finished bullshitting everybody.
Seems like you never grow up...
I have waited..
After years i came back.
And offered you blood.
Open the gate and give me the power.
Power!
What, that can' t be...
Why?
My blood only works once.
I' ve allready used it.
Can you wait till i' il be born again?
I will kill you!
You really think i have killed you?
You can' t bullshitting me.
You can' t bullshittin 'me.
Your blood doesn' t isn' t enough to open the gate.
Do you know why?
Do you understand?
Why i have brought you here?
Yes...
You have made him resurect...
His resurected blood is the true key.
Scream in Schrei in despair!
Scream...
Hey.
You' re talking to much.
Here is the last key...
Now i remeber...
Here i am.
Don' t touch my girl you fucking asshole!
You wanna play before we beginn?
Wait for me...
No Problem.
I never lose.
Stay here.
Wait here till we come back.
He has changed.
This time you might lose.
Perhaps...
We will see, what' s going to happen...
No Pain, No Gain.
Right?
Don' t move...
Don' t move...
I said don' t move!
Get out of the car.
What! what! what! you son of a bitch!!!
We take your car!
Get out of the way!
You fucks!
Allright...
You' re a fighter.
Shut up... I don' t want to be here any longer!
You little assfuck!
Comon, go in!
Let' s go!
Not my fault!!!
You!
Prisoner number KSC2 - 303!
Give me back my right hand!
I' m not lefthanded!
You can' t hit me!
I have 500 times the reflexes than Mike Tyson!
Common!
No chance.
Your power isn' t last enough
The dark side has chosen me.
I told you, i' il never lose.
Listen...
What?
You came back because of the forrest and my blood.
You could die, if you leave this palce.
Maibe...
Let' s see what happens...
I should have been on your side.
In this world, there' s nothing left to be destroyed.
Bring me to the other Side,
Brother.

Do you think he' s really dying?
He' s been dying for ten years.
If he weren' t really dying, he wouldn' t have sent for us.
Maybe he just misses us.
And the senators?
He wouldn' t have summoned them if
Peace, Commodus.
After two weeks on the road, your incessant scheming is hurting my head.
He' s made his decision.
He' s going to announce it.
He will name me.
The first thing I shall do... when is honor him with games worthy of His Majesty.
For now, the first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.
Your Highness?
We seem to be almost there, sir.
- Sire.
- Where' s the emperor?
He' s at the front, sire.
They' ve been gone for 19 days.
The wounded are still coming in.
My horse.
My lord.
Kiss?
You have proved your valor yet again, Maximus.
Let us hope for the last time.
There' s no one left to fight, sire.
There is always someone left to fight.
How can I reward Rome' s greatest general?
Let me go home.
Ah.
Home.
They honor you, Caesar.
It' s for you, Maximus.
They honor you.
Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?
You have missed the war.
Father, congratulations.
I shall sacrifice a hundred bulls to honor your triumph.
Save the bulls.
Honor Maximus.
He won the battle.
- General.
- Highness.
Rome salutes you, and I embrace you as a brother.
It has been too long, my old friend.
- Highness.
- Here, Father.
Take my arm.
I think it is time for me to leave.
So much for the glory of Rome.
Magnificent battle.
- General.
- Still alive?
- Still alive.
- The gods must have a sense of humor.
- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?
Home.
My wife, the son, the harvest.
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.
You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus.
- Here he is.
- Highness.
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.
Beware of Gaius.
He' il pour a honeyed potion in your ear... and you' il wake up one day and all you' il say is, "Republic, republic."
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.
Yes, and in a republic the senate has the power.
But Senator Gaius isn' t influenced by that, of course.
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or senate?
A soldier has the advantage of being able... to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.
Well, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political.
I warned you.
Now I shall save you.
Senators.
Maximus.
I' m going to need good men like you.
How may I be of service, Highness?
You' re a man who knows what it is to command.
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed and the battle is won.
But these senators scheme and squabble and flatter and deceive.
Maximus, we must save Rome from the politicians, my friend.
Can I count on you when the time comes?
Highness, when your father releases me, I intend to return home.
Home?
Well, no one' s earned it more.
Don' t get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.
Lucilla' s here.
Did you know?
She' s not forgotten you.
And now you' re the great man.
If only you had been born a man.
What a caesar you would have made!
Father.
You would have been strong.
I wonder, would you have been just?
I would have been what you taught me to be.
How was your journey?
Long.
Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?
I need your help.
With your brother.
Of course.
He loves you.
He always has.
And... he will need you now more than ever.
Enough of politics.
Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter... and I am a good father.
This is a pleasant fiction, isn' t it?
Good morning.
I need three more horses.
Two!
Three!
Four!
One!
Two!
You sent for me, Caesar?
- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.
Why are we here?
For the glory of the empire, sire.
Ah, yes.
Ah, yes, I remember.
Do you see that map, Maximus?
That is the world which I created.
I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the empire.
Since I became caesar, I' ve known four years without war.
Four years of peace in 20.
And for what?
I brought the sword.
Nothing more.
Caesar, your life
Please.
Please don' t call me that.
Come.
Please.
Come sit.
Let us talk together now very simply as men.
Maximus, talk.
Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud.
Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved.
Two thousand will never leave this place.
I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing.
And what would you believe?
They fought for you and for Rome.
And what is Rome?
I' ve seen much of the rest of the world.
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.
Yet you have never been there.
You have not seen what it has become.
I am dying, Maximus.
When a man sees his end... he wants to know there was some purpose to his life.
How will the world speak my name in years to come?
Will I be known as the philosopher?
The warrior?
The tyrant?
Or will I be the emperor who gave Rome back her true self?
There was once a dream that was Rome.
You could only whisper it.
Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish... it was so fragile.
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.
Maximus...
Let us whisper now... together, you and I.
You have a son.
Tell me about your home.
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.
A very simple place.
Pink stones that warm in the sun.
A kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day... jasmine in the evening.
Through the gate is a giant poplar.
Figs, apples, pears.
The soil, Marcus black.
Black like my wife' s hair.
Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north.
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.
He wants to be one.
- Remember the last time you were home?
- Two years, 264 days and this morning.
I envy you, Maximus.
It' s a good home.
Worth fighting for.
There is one more duty... that I ask of you before you go home.
What would you have me do, Caesar?
I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die.
I will empower you to one end alone to give power back to the people of Rome... and end the corruption that has crippled it.
Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you?
With all my heart, no.
Maximus... that is why it must be you.
But surely a prefect, a senator... somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics.
But you have not been corrupted by her politics.
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.
You have known that since you were young.
Commodus cannot rule.
He must not rule.
You are the son that I should have had.
Commodus will accept my decision.
He knows that you command the loyalty of the army.
I need some time, sire.
Yes.
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.
Now embrace me as my son.
And bring an old man another blanket.
- My father favors you now.
- My lady.
- It was not always so.
- Many things change.
Many things.
Not everything.
Maximus, stop.
Let me see your face.
- You seem upset.
- I lost many men.
What did my father want with you?
To wish me well before I leave for home.
You' re lying.
I could always tell when you were lying because you were never any good at it.
- I never acquired your comfort with it.
- True.
But then you never had to.
Life is more simple for a soldier.
Or do you think me heartless?
I think you have a talent for survival.
Maximus, stop.
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?
No.
I' m tired from battle.
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.
Commodus expects that my father will announce his succession within days.
Will you serve my brother as you served his father?
I will always serve Rome.
I still remember you in my prayers.
Oh, yes.
I pray.
I was sad to hear of your husband' s death.
I mourned him.
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.
Yes.
Lucius.
He' il be nearly eight years old.
My son is also nearly eight.
I thank you for your prayers.
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.
Blessed Mother, come to me with the gods' desire for my future.
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword.
Whisper to them I live only to hold them again.
Ancestors, I honor you... and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.
Cicero.
Sir.
You don' t find it hard to do your duty?
Sometimes I do what I want to do.
The rest of the time I do what I have to.
We may not be able to go home after all.
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?
Yes, Father.
You will not be emperor.
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?
My powers will pass to Maximus... to hold in trust... until the senate is ready to rule once more.
Rome is to be a republic again.
- Maximus.
- Yes.
My decision disappoints you?
Listing the four chief virtues.
Wisdom, justice... fortitude... and temperance.
As I read the list, I knew I had none ofthem.
But I have other virtues, Father.
Ambition.
That can be a virtue when it drives us to excel.
Resourcefulness.
Courage.
Perhaps not on the battlefield, but... there are many forms of courage.
Devotion to my family... and to you.
But none of my virtues were on your list.
Even then it was as if you didn' t want me for your son.
You go too far.
I searched the faces of the gods... for ways to please you, to make you proud.
One kind word... one full hug... where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight... would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years.
What is it in me you hate so much?
All I' ve ever wanted... was to live up to you, Caesar.
- Father.
- Commodus.
Your fault as a son... is my failure as a father.
Come.
Father.
I would butcher the whole world... if you would only have loved me!
Maximus, the emperor needs you.
It' s urgent.
Lament with me, brother.
Our great father is dead.
How did he die?
The surgeons say there was no pain.
His breath gave out as he slept.
Father.
Your emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus.
Take my hand.
I only offer it once.
Quintus.
Hail, Caesar.
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.
Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Sword.
- Sword.
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.
Prudent?
The emperor has been slain.
The emperor died of natural causes.
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!
Please don' t fight, Maximus.
I' m sorry.
Caesar has spoken.
Ride until dawn... and then execute him.
Quintus, look at me.
Look at me!
Promise me that you will look after my family.
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.
Kneel.
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son.
Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again.
At least give me a clean death.
A soldier' s death.
The frost, sometimes it makes the blade stick.
Praetorian!
- Remember the last time you were home?
- Two years, 264 days and this morning.
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword.
Whisper to them I live only to hold them again, for all else is dust and air.
Whisper to them I live only to hold them again... for all else is dust and air.
Papa!
Papa!
Don' t die.
You' il meet them again.
Not yet.
No.
They will clean it.
Wait and see.
Don' t die.
They' il feed you to the lions.
They are worth more than we are.
Better now?
Clean.
You see?
Proximo!
My old friend.
Every day is a great day when you are here... but today is your most fortunate day.
Those giraffes you sold me... they won' t mate.
They just walk around eating... and not mating.
You sold me... queer giraffes.
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.
I do special price for you.
On what?
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.
Do any of them fight?
I' ve got a match coming up.
Some are good for fighting, others for dying.
You need both, I think.
Get up.
What' s your trade?
I was a hunter.
I bought him from a salt mine in Carthage.
Sit down.
Mark of the legion.
- Deserter.
- Maybe so.
But who cares?
- He' s a Spaniard.
- I' il take six.
- For one thousand.
- One thousand?
The Numidian alone is worth 2, 000.
These slaves are rotten.
It all adds to the flavor.
Wait, wait.
Wait!
I can negotiate.
I' il give you 2, 000... and four for the beasts.
That' s 5, 000 for an old friend.
Come on!
How long does it take to get into my own house?
I am Proximo.
I shall be closer to you for the next few days... which will be the last of your miserable lives... than that bitch of a mother that brought you screaming into this world.
I did not pay good money for you for your company.
I paid it so that I could profit from your death.
And as your mother was there at your beginning... so I shall be there at your end.
And when you die, and die you shall... your transition shall be to the sound of
I salute you.
- Red.
- Red.
Yellow.
Yellow.
Good.
- Red.
- Red.
Spaniard.
That' s enough for the moment!
His time will come.
Next.
Spaniard.
Why don' t you fight?
We all have to fight.
Is that the sign of your gods?
Will that not anger them?
The gods favor you.
Red is the gods' color.
You will need their help today.
Some of you are thinking you won' t fight... and some that you can' t fight.
They all say that... until they' re out there.
Listen.
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Thrust this into another man' s flesh.
They will applaud and love you for that.
And you you may begin to love them... for that.
Ultimately... we' re all dead men.
Sadly, we cannot choose how, but... we can decide how we meet that end... in order that we are remembered... as men.
On the left, draw your shields!
On the right, draw your swords!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Pair them up red with yellow.
Next!
Move it!
- Go away!
- You' il never rule us, Commodus!
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?
Give him time, Gracchus.
He' s young.
I think he could do very well.
For Rome, or for you?
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It' s what she' d like.
Lucius!
Mother!
Hail, Caesar.
Senators.
Rome greets her new emperor.
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness.
Thank you, Falco.
And for the loyal subjects, I trust they weren' t too expensive.
- Caesar.
- Gracchus.
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.
There are many matters that require your attention.
To order, please!
To order!
For your guidance, Caesar, the senate has prepared a series of protocols... to begin addressing the many problems in the city... beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek quarter... to combat the plague which is already springing up there.
So, if Caesar
Don' t you see, Gracchus?
That' s the very problem, isn' t it?
My father spent all his time at study... at books of learning and philosophy.
He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the senate.
And all the while the people were forgotten.
But the senate is the people, sire... chosen from among the people to speak for the people.
I doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Gracchus... or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.
I think I understand my own people.
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us... out of his own extensive experience.
I call it love.
I am their father.
The people are my children.
I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly.
Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?
I assure you that you shall.
Senator, my brother is very tired.
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.
My lady, as always... your lightest touch commands obedience.
Who are they to lecture me?
Commodus, the senate has its uses.
What uses?
All they do is talk.
It should be just... you and me... and Rome.
Don' t even think it.
There' s always been a senate.
Rome has changed.
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.
Of course, but leave the people their
Illusions?
Traditions.
My father' s war against the barbarians
He said it himself: it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.
The people always love victories.
Why?
They didn' t see the battles.
What do they care about Germania?
They care about the greatness of Rome.
The greatness of Rome.
Well, what is that?
It' s an idea greatness.
Greatness is a vision.
Exactly.
A vision.
Do you not see, Lucilla?
I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they will love me for it.
And they' il soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry old men.
I will give the people the greatest vision of their lives.
White and red wine for your drinking pleasure!
Games.
One hundred and fifty days of games.
He' s cleverer than I thought.
Clever.
The whole of Rome would be laughing at him... if they weren' t so afraid of his praetorian.
Fear and wonder a powerful combination.
You really think the people are going to be seduced by that?
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.
Conjure magic for them, and they' il be distracted.
Take away their freedom, and still they' il roar.
The beating heart of Rome... is not the marble of the senate.
It' s the sand of the Colosseum.
He' il bring them death... and they will love him for it.
Spaniard.
Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?
Is this not why you are here?
Spaniard!
Spaniard!
What do you want?
Girl?
Boy?
You sent for me.
Yes, I did.
You' re good, Spaniard, but you' re not that good.
You could be magnificent.
I' m required to kill, so I kill.
That is enough.
That' s enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.
The young emperor... has arranged a series of spectacles... to commemorate his father...
Marcus Aurelius.
I find that amusing... since it was Marcus Aurelius the wise, the all- knowing Marcus Aurelius that closed us down.
So, finally, after five years of scratching a living... in flea- infested villages... we' re finally going back to where we belong the Colosseum.
Oh, you should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.
Fifty thousand Romans... watching every movement of your sword... willing you to make that killer blow.
The silence before you strike... and the noise afterwards.
It rises.
Like a storm... as if you were the thunder god himself.
You were a gladiator?
Yes, I was.
You won your freedom?
A long time ago, the emperor... presented me with a rudis.
It' s just a wooden sword.
The symbol of your freedom.
He touched me on the shoulder, and I was free.
You knew Marcus Aurelius?
I did not say I knew him.
I said he touched me on the shoulder once.
You asked me what I want.
I, too, want to stand in front of the emperor... as you did.
Then listen to me.
Learn from me.
I wasn' t the best because I killed quickly.
I was the best because the crowd loved me.
Win the crowd... and you' il win your freedom.
I will win the crowd.
I will give them something they' ve never seen before.
So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together... and have bloody adventures... and the great whore will suckle us... until we are fat and happy and can suckle no more.
And then... when enough men have died... perhaps you will have your freedom.
Here.
Use this.
It' s somewhere out there my country... my home.
My wife is preparing food.
My daughters carry water from the river.
Will I ever see them again?
I think no.
Do you believe you' il see them again when you die?
I think so.
I will die soon.
They will not die for many years.
I' il have to wait.
But you would wait?
Of course.
You see... my wife... and my son... are already waiting for me.
You' il meet them again.
But not yet.
Not yet, unless
Not yet.
Not yet.
There.
There it is.
Out.
Go!
Go!
Out!
Good to see you again, old friend.
Bring me fortune.
Have you ever seen anything like that before?
I didn' t know men could build such things.
Win the crowd.
Get inside!
Move!
Inside!
He sleeps so well because he' s loved.
Come, brother.
It' s late.
I will make Rome the wonder ofthe ages.
That is what Gracchus and his friends don' t understand.
All my desires are splitting my head to pieces.
Drink this tonic.
I think the time is almost right.
I could announce the dissolution of the senate... at the celebration to honor our father.
Do you think I should?
Are the people ready?
I think you need your rest now.
Will you stay with me?
Still afraid of the dark, brother?
Still.
Always.
- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won' t.
Then kiss me.
Sleep, brother.
Come on!
Take me.
All right, that' s enough.
The emperor wants battles, and I don' t want to sacrifice my best fighters.
The crowd wants battles, so the emperor gives them battles.
- And you get the battle of Carthage.
- The massacre of Carthage.
Why don' t you go down to the prison, round up all the beggars and thieves?
We' ve done that.
If you want to give away the best gladiators in the whole of the empire... then I want double the rates.
You' il get your contract rates, or you' il get your contract canceled.
You don' t like it?
Then you can crawl back down that shithole that you came from.
Cassius, please!
Cassius!
Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard?
Yes.
They said you were a giant.
They said you could crush a man' s skull with one hand.
A man' s?
No.
A boy' s.
- They have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.
This is Argento... and this is Scarto.
They were my horses.
They were taken from me.
I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer for you.
- They let you watch the games?
- My uncle says it makes me strong.
- And what does your father say?
- My father is dead.
Master Lucius, it is time.
I have to go.
Your name is Lucius?
Lucius Verus, after my father.
Lower!
Claudius!
- Yes?
- More shields!
When the emperor enters... raise your weapons, salute him... and then speak together.
Face the emperor... and don' t turn your back on him.
Go, and die with honor.
Hail, mighty Caesar!
Caesar!
Caesar!
Caesar!
Caesar!
We who are about to die salute you!
On this day... we reach back to hallowed antiquity... to bring you a re- creation... of the second fall of mighty Carthage!
On the barren plain of Zama... there stood the invincible armies... of the barbarian Hannibal.
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors... from all brute nations... bent on merciless... destruction... conquest.
Your emperor... is pleased to give you... the barbarian horde!
Anyone here been in the army?
Yes.
I served with you at Vindobona.
You can help me.
Whatever comes out oft hese gates... we' ve got a better chance of survival if we work together.
Do you understand?
If we stay together, we survive.
The emperor is pleased to bring you the legionnaires... of Scipio Africanus!
To the death!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Stay close!
Come together!
Staggered columns!
Staggered columns!
- Soon all your men will be slain.
- You don' t have a chance.
Lock your shields!
Stay as one!
Hold!
Hold!
As one!
Well done!
Hold!
Down low!
Down low!
Yes!
Hagen!
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!
Quickly!
- Get out there!
- Hurry!
Maximus!
Single column!
Single column!
We win!
My history' s a little hazy, Cassius... but shouldn' t the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?
Yes, sire.
Forgive me, sire.
No, I rather enjoy surprises.
Who is he?
They call him the Spaniard, sire.
- I think I' il meet him.
- Yes, sire.
Hail to the barbarians!
Forward!
Arms at ready!
Drop your weapons.
Gladiator, the emperor has asked for you.
I am at the emperor' s service.
Rise.
Rise.
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.
I don' t think there' s ever been a gladiator to match you.
As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn.
Or was it Hercules?
Why doesn' t the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name?
You do have a name?
My name is Gladiator.
How dare you show your back to me?
Slave!
You will remove your helmet and tell me your name.
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius... commander of the armies of the north... general of the Felix Legions...
loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius... father to a murdered son... husband to a murdered wife... and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.
Arms!
Live!
Live!
Live!
Live!
Guards, at rest!
Maximus!
Maximus!
Maximus!
Maximus!
Why is he still alive?
I don' t know.
He shouldn' t be alive.
It vexes me.
I' m terribly vexed.
I did what I had to do.
If Father had had his way, the empire would have been torn apart.
You do see that?
What did you feel when you saw him?
I felt nothing.
He wounded you deeply, didn' t he?
No more than I wounded him.
They lied to me in Germania.
They told me he was dead.
If they lie to me, they don' t respect me.
If they don' t respect me, how can they ever love me?
Then you must let the legions know... their treachery... will not go unpunished.
Poor sister.
I wouldn' t want to be your enemy.
What will you do?
This way.
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.
I knew your brother would send assassins.
I didn' t realize he would send his best.
Maximus, he doesn' t know.
My family was burnt and crucified while they were still alive.
- I knew nothing - Don' t lie to me!
I wept for them.
As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father?
I have been living in a prison of fear since that day.
To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother.
To live in terror every moment of every day... because your son is heir to the throne.
Oh, I have wept.
My son... was innocent.
So is mine.
Must my son die, too, before you' il trust me?
What does it matter if I trust you or not?
The gods have spared you.
Don' t you understand?
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome.
The gods have spared me?
I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse the mob.
That is power.
The mob is Rome, and while Commodus controls them, he controls everything.
Listen to me.
My brother has enemies, most of all in the senate.
But while the people follow him... no one would dare stand up to him until you.
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.
There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome.
One man above all.
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?
Do you not understand?
I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow.
I am a slave!
What possible difference can I make?
This man wants what you want.
Then have him kill Commodus!
I knew a man once... a noble man, a man of principle... who loved my father... and my father loved him.
This man served Rome well.
That man is gone.
Your brother did his work well.
Let me help you.
Yes... you can help me.
Forget you ever knew me... and never come here again.
Guard!
The lady is finished with me.
Maximus.
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?
In Germania?
In many countries.
General!
You have a great name.
He must kill your name before he kills you.
Yes, at the far end.
- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.
Senator Gracchus.
Don' t often see you enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.
I don' t pretend to be a man of the people, Senator... but I do try to be a man for the people.
Caesar!
Caesar!
Caesar!
Caesar!
People of Rome!
On the fourth day of Antioch... we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.
And in his majestic charity... the emperor has deigned this day to favor the people of Rome... with an historical final match.
Caesar is pleased to bring you... the only undefeated champion... in Roman history... the legendary Tigris... of Gaul!
He knows too well how to manipulate the mob.
Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome.
This is not it.
This is not it!
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.
We mortals are but shadows and dust.
Shadows and dust, Maximus!
Caesar is proud to give you...
Aelius Maximus!
They embrace him like he' s one of their own.
The mob is fickle, brother.
He' il be forgotten in a month.
No, much sooner than that.
It' s been arranged.
We who are about to die salute you.
We' re with you, Maximus!
Pull!
Pull!
Pull!
Loose!
Loose!
- Gut him!
- Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Maximus the Merciful!
Forward, guards!
On battery!
What am I going to do with you?
You simply won' t... die.
Are we so different, you and I?
You take life when you have to... as I do.
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.
Then take it now.
They tell me your son... squealed like a girl... when they nailed him to the cross... and your wife... moaned like a whore... when they ravaged her... again and again... and again.
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end...
Highness.
General!
General!
- General!
- Cicero!
- Where are you camped?
- Ostia.
- We love you, Maximus!
- Praise the victor!
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.
- Move along!
- Find me!
Can they hear you?
Who?
Your family, in the afterlife.
- Oh, yes.
- What do you say to them?
I tell him I will see him again soon... and to keep his heels down when he is riding his horse.
To my wife... that is not your business.
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.
So I can' t just kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful.
The whole thing is like some great nightmare.
He is defying you.
His every victory is an act of defiance.
The mob sees this, and so do the senate.
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.
- Kill him.
- No.
I will not make a martyr of him.
I have been told... of a certain sea snake... which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey.
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded.
Then its enemies will approach... and yet it will lie quite still.
Then its enemies will take little bites of it... and yet it remains still.
So... we will lie still... and let our enemies come to us and nibble.
Have every senator followed.
Cicero, my old friend.
I thought perhaps I' d seen you for the last time.
- I thought you were dead.
- Close.
- How long have the men been in Ostia?
- All winter.
- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.
- Who' s in command?
- Some fool from Rome.
How soon could they be ready to fight?
For you, tomorrow.
I need you to do something for me.
Come see.
If you haven' t been in the arena, you can see the show here.
Giant Maximus is defeating our emperor Commodus.
What are we to do?
He' s defying everyone.
My goodness!
- He got him!
He' s defeated!
- Give way!
Give way!
My lady?
I served your father at Vindobona.
- Back.
- My lady.
I served your father at Vindobona.
Back!
I serve him still.
Stop.
Stop.
Stand back.
The general sends word he will meet your politician.
For your loyalty, soldier.
Thank you, my lady.
Leave us.
Senator Gracchus.
General.
I hope my coming here today is evidence enough... that you can trust me.
- The senate is with you?
- The senate?
Yes.
I can speak for them.
You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome?
To what end?
Get me outside the city walls.
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia.
My army is encamped there.
By nightfall of the second day, I shall return at the head of 5, 000 men.
Loyal to Commodus.
Let my men see me alive and you shall see where their loyalties lie.
This is madness.
No Roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years.
I will not trade one dictatorship for another!
The time for half measures and talk is over, Senator.
And after your glorious coup, what then?
You' il take your 5, 000 warriors and leave?
I will leave.
The soldiers will stay for your protection... under the command of the senate.
So... once all of Rome is yours, you' il just give it back to the people?
Tell me why.
Because that was the last wish of a dying man.
I will kill Commodus.
The fate of Rome I leave to you.
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.
His daughter trusts you.
I will trust you.
But we have little time.
Give me two days... and I will buy your freedom.
And you you stay alive... or I' il be dead.
Now we must go.
It won' t work.
The emperor knows too much.
And as for me... it' s becoming dangerous.
I give you my word.
Your word?
What if you don' t return?
Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo?
Trust?
Who am I to trust?
- I will kill Commodus.
- Why would I want that?
He makes me rich.
Oh,
I know that you are a man of your word, General.
I know that you would die for honor.
You would die for Rome.
You would die for the memory of your ancestors.
But I, on the other hand
I' m an entertainer.
Guard!
He killed the man who set you free.
Praetorians, master.
Halt!
Where have you been?
I sent for you.
Please, brother.
What' s troubling you?
Does Gracchus have a new lover?
I don' t know.
I thought you' d seen him.
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.
For the health of Rome, the senate must be bled.
And he will bleed too.
Very soon.
But not tonight.
Do you remember what our father said once?
Life is. "
Do you think that' s true?
I don' t know.
I think it is.
And I have only you to share it with.
Open your mouth.
You know I love you.
And I love you.
Out.
Get out!
Move!
Congratulations, General.
You' ve got very persuasive friends.
My brother' s had Gracchus arrested.
We daren' t wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.
Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate.
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there with horses.
You have done all this?
Yes.
You risk too much.
I have much to pay for.
You have nothing to pay for.
You love your son.
You' re strong for him.
I am tired of being strong.
My brother hates all the world, and you most of all.
- Because your father chose me.
- No.
Because my father loved you.
And because I loved you.
A long time ago.
Was I very different then?
You laughed more.
I have felt alone all my life... except with you.
I must go.
Yes.
There.
There.
And I got you.
Isn' t it late to be playing legionnaire?
I' m not a legionnaire.
- Not a legionnaire?
- I' m a gladiator.
A gladiator?
Gladiators only fight in the games.
Wouldn' t you rather be a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?
I' m Maximus, the savior of Rome!
The savior of Rome?
And who said that?
Where' s Lucius?
He' s with the emperor.
- She couldn' t.
- Yes, she did.
She took it from a basket... and pressed it to her breast, right here above her heart.
It bit her in the breast?
Yes.
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies... behave very strangely and do very odd things in the name of love.
I think it' s silly.
So do I.
So do I.
Sister, join us.
I' ve been reading to dear Lucius.
- I' ve been reading too.
- Yes.
He' s a very clever little boy.
He' il make a grand emperor one day.
We' ve been reading about the great Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.
And the queen killed herself with a snake.
And just wait until you hear what happened to our ancestors.
If you' re very good, tomorrow night I' il tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.
He was betrayed... by those closest to him... by his own blood.
They whispered in dark corners... and went out late at night... and conspired... and conspired.
But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something.
He knew they were busy little bees.
And one night he sat down with one of them... and he looked at her... and he said...
"Tell me what you' ve been doing... busy little bee... or I shall strike down those dearest to you.
You shall watch as I bathe in their blood. "
And the emperor was heart broken.
The little bee had wounded him more deeply... than anyone else could ever have done.
What do you think happened then, Lucius?
I don' t know, Uncle.
The little bee told him everything.
Open, in the name of the emperor!
Proximo!
Open the gates, in the name of the emperor!
Open the gates!
Open the gates, Proximo.
Do you want to die, old man?
Here.
Everything is prepared.
It seems you have won your freedom.
Are you in danger of becoming a good man?
- Juba.
- All enemies of the emperor die!
Open the gates!
Pull!
Move!
Form a column on the left!
I only need moments, so do not be careless with your lives.
If you don' t want any part of this, go back to your cells.
We' il wait here for you, Maximus.
- Strength and honor.
- Go.
Strength and honor.
Aim.
Arch your bows!
Shadows and dust.
I' m sorry.
It' s done.
And what of my nephew?
And what of his mother?
Should they share her lover' s fate?
Or should I be merciful?
Commodus the Merciful.
Lucius will stay with me now.
And if his mother... so much as looks at me... in a manner that displeases me... he will die.
If she decides... to be noble... and takes her own life... he will die.
And as for you... you will love me... as I loved you.
You will provide me with an heir... of pure blood... so that Commodus and his progeny... will rule for a thousand years.
Am I not merciful?
Am I not merciful?
They call for you.
The general... who became a slave.
The slave who became a gladiator.
The gladiator who defied an emperor.
A striking story.
Now the people want to know how the story ends.
Only a famous death will do.
And what could be more glorious... than to challenge the emperor himself in the great arena?
You would fight me?
Why not?
Do you think I' m afraid?
I think you have been afraid all your life.
Unlike Maximus the Invincible, who knows no fear?
I knew a man who once said, "Death smiles at us all.
All a man can do is smile back. "
Did your friend smile at his own death?
You must know.
He was your father.
You loved my father, I know... but so did I.
That makes us brothers, doesn' t it?
Smile for me now, brother.
Strap on his armor.
Conceal the wound.
Ring formation!
Quintus, sword.
Give me your sword.
Sword!
Give me a sword!
Sheathe your swords.
Free my men.
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.
There was a dream that was Rome.
It shall be realized.
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.
Free the prisoners.
Go!
Lucius is safe.
Go to them.
You' re home.
Is Rome worth one good man' s life?
We believed it once.
Make us believe it again.
He was a soldier of Rome.
Honor him.
Who will help me carry him?
Now we are free.
I will see you again.
But not yet.
Not yet.
The world is changed.
I feel it in the water.
I feel it in the earth.
I smell it in the air.
For none now live who remember it.
It began with the forging of the Great Rings.
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
And nine...... nine rings were gifted to the race of Men...... who, above all else, desire power.
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
But they were all of them deceived.
For another ring was made.
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom...... the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring...... to control all others.
And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice...... and his will to dominate all life.
One Ring to rule them all.
One by one...... the Free Lands of Middle- earth fell to the power of the Ring.
But there were some who resisted.
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor.
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle- earth.
Victory was near.
But the power of the Ring...... could not be undone.
It was in this moment...... when all hope had faded...... that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father' s sword.
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle- earth, was defeated.
The Ring passed to Isildur...... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.
But the hearts of Men...... are easily corrupted.
And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.
It betrayed Isildur to his death.
And some things that should not have been forgotten...... were lost.
History became legend...... legend became myth.
And for two and a half thousand years...... the Ring passed out of all knowledge.
Until, when chance came...... it ensnared a new bearer.
My precious.
The Ring came to the creature Gollum...... who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.
And there it consumed him.
It came to me.
My own.
My love.
My own.
My precious.
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.
And in the gloom of Gollum' s cave, it waited.
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...... whispers of a nameless fear.
And the Ring of Power perceived...... its time had now come.
It abandoned Gollum.
But something happened then the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.
What' s this?
A Hobbit.
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.
A ring.
Lost!
My precious is lost!
For the time will soon come...... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.
The Shire... 60 years later
Now far ahead the road has gone
- And I must follow if I can - You' re late.
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.
It' s wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
You didn' t think I' d miss your Uncle Bilbo' s birthday?
Tell me everything.
Everything?
You' re far too eager and curious for a Hobbit.
Most unnatural.
Well, what can I tell you?
Life in the wide world goes on much as it has this past Age.
Full of its own comings and goings.
Scarcely aware of the existence of Hobbits.
For which I am very thankful.
The long- expected party.
How is the old rascal?
You know Bilbo.
He' s got the whole place in an uproar.
Well, that should please him.
- Half the Shire' s been invited.
- Gracious me.
- Oh, really?
All right, then.
Keep your secrets.
Indeed.
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
If you' re referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved.
All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.
Whatever you did, you' ve been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.
Oh, really?
Fireworks, Gandalf!
- I' m glad you' re back.
- So am I, dear boy.
So am I.
No, thank you!
We don' t want any more visitors, well- wishers or distant relations!
And what about very old friends?
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!
Good to see you.
111 years old!
Who would believe it?
You haven' t aged a day.
Come on, come in!
Welcome, welcome.
Or maybe something a little stronger?
I' ve got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left.
Very good year.
Almost as old as I am.
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?
Just tea, thank you.
I was expecting you sometime last week.
Always have and always will.
You caught me a bit unprepared.
We' ve only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...
There' s some cheese here.
No, that won' t do.
We' ve got raspberry jam, an apple tart...
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we' re all right.
I' ve just found some sponge cake.
I could make you some eggs if you' d...
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.
- You don' t mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.
I' m not at home!
I' ve got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day...... never giving me a moment' s peace.
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!
And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book.
Oh, tea.
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes.
It' s all in hand.
All the arrangements are made.
Frodo suspects something.
Of course he does.
He' s a Baggins...... not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.
You will tell him, won' t you?
- He' s very fond of you.
I know.
He' d probably come with me if I asked him.
I think in his heart, Frodo' s still in love with the Shire.
The woods, the fields.
Little rivers.
I am old, Gandalf.
I know I don' t look it, but I' m beginning to feel it in my heart.
I feel thin.
Sort of stretched...... like butter scraped over too much bread.
I need a holiday.
A very long holiday.
And I don' t expect I shall return.
In fact, I mean not to.
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the Southfarthing.
Gandalf, my old friend...... this will be a night to remember.
Welcome, welcome.
Go on, Sam.
Ask Rosie for a dance.
- I think I' il just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don' t.
Go on!
So there I was...... at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly.
They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors...... that the sun' s first light crept over the top of the trees...... and turned them all to stone!
Quickly.
No, the big one.
- You' re supposed to stick it in the ground.
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!
This was your idea.
Watch out for the dragon!
Nonsense.
There hasn' t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years.
- That was good.
- Let' s get another one.
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.
I might' ve known.
Speech, Bilbo!
Speech!
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...... Tooks and Brandybucks...... Grubbs, Chubbs...... Hornblowers...... Bolgers...... Bracegirdles...
- Proudfeet!
Today is my 111th birthday!
But alas, eleventy- one years is far too short a time to live among...... such excellent and admirable Hobbits.
I don' t know half of you half as well as I should like...... and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
I have things to do.
I' ve put this off far too long.
I regret to announce this is the end!
I' m going now.
I bid you all a very fond farewell.
Goodbye.
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?
There are many magic rings in this world, and none of them should be used lightly.
It was just a bit of fun.
Oh, you' re probably right, as usual.
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won' t you?
- Two eyes.
As often as I can spare them.
- I' m leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.
It' s in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.
No.
Wait, it' s...... here in my pocket.
Isn' t that odd, now?
Yet, after all, why not?
- Why shouldn' t I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.
Is that so hard?
Well, no.
And yes.
I found it!
It came to me!
- There' s no need to get angry.
- Well, if I' m angry, it' s your fault!
It' s mine.
My own.
- My precious.
- Precious?
It' s been called that before, but not by you.
What business is it of yours what I do with my own things?
I think you' ve had that ring quite long enough.
- You want it for yourself!
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.
I am not trying to rob you.
I' m trying to help you.
All your long years, we' ve been friends.
Trust me as you once did.
Let it go.
You' re right, Gandalf.
The ring must go to Frodo.
It' s late.
The road is long.
Yes, it is time.
The ring is still in your pocket.
I' ve thought up an ending for my book:
"And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days."
And I' m sure you will, my dear friend.
Goodbye, Gandalf.
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.
Until our next meeting.
It' s mine.
My own.
My precious.
Riddles in the dark.
My precious.
Precious.
He' s gone, hasn' t he?
He talked for so long about leaving...... I didn' t think he' d really do it.
Bilbo' s ring.
He' s left you Bag End.
Along with all his possessions.
The ring is yours now.
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?
- Questions.
Questions that need answering.
- You' ve only just arrived.
I don' t understand.
Neither do I.
Keep it secret.
Keep it safe.
Shire!
Baggins!
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.
Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor...... and the finding of the Ring of Power. "
"It has come to me.
The One Ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.
All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate...... for I will risk no hurt to the Ring.
It is precious to me...... though I buy it with great pain.
The markings upon the band begin to fade.
The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared.
A secret now that only fire can tell. "
Shire.
Baggins.
There' s no Bagginses around here.
They' re all up in Hobbiton.
That way.
Is it secret?
Is it safe?
What are you doing?
Hold out your hand, Frodo.
It' s quite cool.
What can you see?
Can you see anything?
Nothing.
There' s nothing.
Wait.
There are markings.
It' s some form of Elvish.
I can' t read it.
There are few who can.
The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
In the common tongue, it says:
"One Ring to rule them all...... One Ring to find them...... One Ring to bring them all...... and in the darkness bind them."
This is the One Ring...... forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom.
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.
Bilbo found it.
- Yes.
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo' s keeping...... prolonging his life, delaying old age.
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.
The Ring has awoken.
It' s heard its master' s call.
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.
No, Frodo.
The spirit of Sauron endured.
His life force is bound to the Ring, and the Ring survived.
Sauron has returned.
His Orcs have multiplied.
His fortress at Barad- dûr is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness.
He is seeking it.
Seeking it.
All his thought is bent on it.
For the Ring yearns above all else...... to return to the hand of its master.
They are one...... the Ring and the Dark Lord.
Frodo...... he must never find it.
All right.
We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.
No one knows it' s here, do they?
Do they, Gandalf?
There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring.
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.
But the enemy found him first.
I don' t know how long they tortured him.
But amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words:
Shire.
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!
Who goes there?
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!
- I' m giving it to you!
- Don' t tempt me, Frodo!
I dare not take it.
Not even to keep it safe.
Understand, Frodo...... I would use this Ring from a desire to do good.
But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
No, it can' t.
What must I do?
- You must leave.
- Where?
Where do I go?
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.
- What about you?
- I' il be waiting for you...... at the inn of the Prancing Pony.
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don' t know, Frodo.
I don' t have any answers.
I must see the head of my order.
He is both wise and powerful.
Trust me, Frodo.
He' il know what to do.
You' il have to leave the name of Baggins behind you.
That name is not safe outside the Shire.
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.
I can cut across country easily enough.
My dear Frodo.
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.
You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month.
And yet, after a hundred years...... they can still surprise you.
Get down.
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?
Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.
A little late for trimming the verge, don' t you think?
- I heard raised voices.
Speak!
Nothing important.
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don' t hurt me.
Don' t turn me into anything unnatural.
No?
Perhaps not.
I' ve thought of a better use for you.
Come along, Samwise.
Keep up.
Be careful, both of you.
The enemy has many spies in his service:
Birds, beasts.
Is it safe?
Never put it on...... for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power.
Always remember, Frodo...... the Ring is trying to get back to its master.
It wants to be found.
This is it.
This is what?
If I take one more step...... it' il be the farthest away from home I' ve ever been.
Come on, Sam.
Remember what Bilbo used to say:
- "Going out your door.
You step onto the road, and if you don' t keep your feet...... there' s no knowing where you might be swept off to. "
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.
The hour grows late.
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...... seeking my counsel.
For that is why you have come, is it not?
My old friend.
Saruman.
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.
So the Ring of Power has been found.
All these long years, it was in the Shire.
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.
Your love of the halfling' s leaf has clearly slowed your mind.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.
Time?
What time do you think we have?
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.
He cannot yet take physical form...... but his spirit has lost none of its potency.
Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.
A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
The Eye of Sauron.
He is gathering all evil to him.
Very soon, he' il have summoned an army great enough for an assault upon Middle- earth.
You know this?
How?
I have seen it.
A palantír is a dangerous tool, Saruman.
Why should we fear to use it?
They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing- stones.
We do not know who else may be watching.
The hour is later than you think.
Sauron' s forces are already moving.
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer' s Eve...... disguised as riders in black.
- They' ve reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.
And kill the one who carries it.
Frodo!
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?
There are none who can.
Against the power of Mordor...... there can be no victory.
We must join with him, Gandalf.
We must join with Sauron.
It would be wise, my friend.
Tell me...... friend...... when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?
I gave you the chance...... of aiding me willingly...... but you have elected the way of pain!
- I thought I' d lost you.
- What are you talking about?
- It' s just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?
"Don' t you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don' t mean to.
Sam, we' re still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?
- Hello, Frodo.
Get off him.
What' s the meaning of this?
You' ve been into Farmer Maggot' s crop!
Get out of my field!
I don' t know why he' s so upset.
And some cabbages.
And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin.
My point is...... he' s clearly overreacting.
Run!
Oh, that was close.
I think I' ve broken something.
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!
What?
That was just a detour.
A shortcut.
- Shortcut to what?
- Mushrooms!
I think we should get off the road.
Get off the road!
Quick!
Be quiet!
What was that?
Anything?
Nothing.
What is going on?
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.
Get down!
I have to leave the Shire.
Sam and I must get to Bree.
Right.
Follow me.
This way!
Follow me!
Get the rope, Sam!
Run, Frodo!
- Come on!
- How far to the nearest crossing?
20 miles.
Come on.
- What do you want?
- We' re heading for the Prancing Pony.
Hobbits.
Four Hobbits!
- What business brings you to Bree?
- We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.
It' s my job to ask questions after nightfall.
There' s talk of strange folk abroad.
Can' t be too careful.
Excuse me.
Good evening, little masters.
If you' re seeking accommodation, we got some cozy Hobbit- sized rooms available.
Mister...?
Underhill.
My name' s Underhill.
- Underhill, yes.
- Can you tell him we' ve arrived?
Oh, yes...... I remember.
Big grey beard, pointy hat.
Not seen him for six months.
What do we do now?
He' il come.
What' s that?
This, my friend, is a pint.
It comes in pints?
- I' m getting one.
- You got a whole half already!
That fellow' s done nothing but stare at you since we arrived.
Excuse me.
That Man in the corner.
Who is he?
He' s one of them Rangers.
They' re dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.
What his right name is, I' ve never heard, but around here he' s known as Strider.
Strider.
Baggins.
Baggins.
Sure, I know a Baggins.
He' s over there.
He' s my second cousin, once removed on his mother' s side...... and my third cousin, twice removed...
- Steady on, Frodo.
You cannot hide.
I see you.
There is no life...... in the void.
Only...... death.
You draw far too much attention to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."
What do you want?
That is no trinket you carry.
- I carry nothing.
I can avoid being seen if I wish...... but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?
Yes.
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.
Or I' il have you, Longshanks.
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.
They' re coming.
What are they?
They were once Men.
Great kings of Men.
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power.
Blinded by their greed, they took them without question.
One by one, falling into darkness.
Now they are slaves to his will.
They are the Nazgûl.
Ringwraiths.
Neither living nor dead.
At all times they feel...... the presence of the Ring...... drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.
How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?
We have no choice but to trust him.
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that?
Rivendell.
We' re going to see the Elves.
- What about breakfast?
- You' ve already had it.
- We' ve had one, yes.
What about second breakfast?
Don' t think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.
What about elevenses?
Luncheon?
Afternoon tea?
Supper?
- He knows about them, doesn' t he?
- I wouldn' t count on it.
The power of Isengard is at your command...... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?
We have work to do.
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.
Rip them all down.
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl.
We shall rest here tonight.
These are for you.
Keep them close.
I' m going to have a look around.
Stay here.
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!
- Put it out!
Ash on my tomatoes!
Go!
Back, you devils!
- Help him, Strider.
- He' s been stabbed by a Morgul blade.
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.
Hurry!
We' re six days from Rivendell!
He' il never make it!
Hold on, Frodo.
He' s going cold.
Is he going to die?
He' s passing into the Shadow World.
He' il soon become a Wraith like them.
- They' re close.
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.
Kingsfoil, aye, it' s a weed.
It may help to slow the poisoning.
What' s this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?
I am Arwen - I' ve come to help you.
Hear my voice...
Come back to the light.
Who is she?
- She' s an Elf.
- He' s fading.
He' s not going to last.
We must get him to my father.
- Where are you taking him?
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.
Stay with the Hobbits - I' il send horses for you.
I' m the faster rider - I' il take him.
The Road is too dangerous.
What are they saying?
If I can get across the river...... the power of my people will protect him.
I do not fear them.
Arwen...... ride hard.
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!
Give up the halfling, She- Elf.
If you want him, come and claim him.
Frodo, no.
Frodo, don' t give in.
Not now.
What grace is given me...... let it pass to him.
Let him be spared.
Save him.
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.
And it is 10: 00 in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know.
- Yes, I' m here.
And you' re lucky to be here too.
A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid.
But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.
What happened, Gandalf?
- Why didn' t you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.
I was delayed.
A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.
It is over.
Embrace the power of the Ring...... or embrace your own destruction!
There is only one Lord of the Ring.
Only one who can bend it to his will.
And he does not share power.
So you have chosen death.
What is it?
Nothing, Frodo.
- Bless you, you' re awake!
Sam has hardly left your side.
Weren' t we, Mr. Gandalf?
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you' re beginning to mend.
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.
"There and Back Again:
A Hobbit' s Tale, by Bilbo Baggins. "
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...... wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...... visit Lake- town...... see the Lonely Mountain again.
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.
I miss the Shire.
I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else.
Off with you, on one of your adventures.
But my own adventure turned out to be quite different.
I' m not like you, Bilbo.
My dear boy.
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?
No harm in being prepared.
- I do.
- More than anything.
- I did.
It' s just...
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn' t we?
We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought...... seeing as how you' re on the mend, we' d be off soon.
Off home.
You are right, Sam.
We did what we set out to do.
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.
I am ready to go home.
His strength returns.
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.
And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...... the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.
Sauron' s forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.
Our list of allies grows thin.
His treachery runs deeper than you know.
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin- men.
He' s breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.
An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.
Saruman is coming for the Ring.
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves.
We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!
Gandalf...... the Ring cannot stay here.
This peril belongs to all Middle- earth.
They must decide now how to end it.
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.
Who will you look to when we' ve gone?
The Dwarves?
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.
It is in Men that we must place our hope.
Men?
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.
The blood of Númenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten.
It is because of Men the Ring survives.
I was there, Gandalf.
I was there 3000 years ago...
... when Isildur took the Ring.
I was there the day the strength of Men failed.
Isildur, hurry!
Follow me.
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...... where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed.
Cast it into the fire!
- Destroy it!
It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure.
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.
There' s no strength left in the world of Men.
- They' re scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.
He turned from that path a long time ago.
He has chosen exile.
The shards of Narsil.
The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron' s hand.
It' s still sharp.
But no more than a broken heirloom.
Why do you fear the past?
You are Isildur' s heir, not Isildur himself.
You are not bound to his fate.
The same blood flows in my veins.
The same weakness.
Your time will come.
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.
Not over you... not over me.
Do you remember when we first met?
I thought I had strayed into a dream.
Long years have passed.
You did not have the cares you carry now.
Do you remember what I told you?
You said you' d bind yourself to me...... forsaking the immortal life of your people.
And to that I hold.
I would rather share one lifetime with you...... than face all the Ages of this world alone.
I choose a mortal life.
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...
... like my heart.
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...... you' ve been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.
Middle- earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it.
You will unite, or you will fall.
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.
So it is true.
- The doom of Man.
- It is a gift.
A gift to the foes of Mordor.
Why not use this Ring?
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...... kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...... are your lands kept safe.
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.
And what would a Ranger know of this matter?
This is no mere Ranger.
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
You owe him your allegiance.
This is Isildur' s heir?
And heir to the throne of Gondor.
Sit down, Legolas.
Gondor has no king.
Gondor needs no king.
Aragorn is right.
We cannot use it.
You have only one choice.
The Ring must be destroyed.
What are we waiting for?
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Glóin...... by any craft that we here possess.
Only there can it be unmade.
It must be taken deep into Mordor...... and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.
One of you...... must do this.
One does not simply walk into Mordor.
Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.
There is evil there that does not sleep.
The Great Eye is ever- watchful.
It is a barren wasteland...... riddled with fire, and ash and dust.
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.
Not with 10, 000 men could you do this.
It is folly.
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
The Ring must be destroyed.
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!
And if we fail, what then?
What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!
Never trust an Elf!
Do you not understand?
While you bicker amongst yourselves, Sauron' s power grows!
None can escape it!
You' il all be destroyed!
I will take it.
I will take the Ring to Mordor.
Though...
... I do not know the way.
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...... as long as it is yours to bear.
If by my life or death I can protect you...... I will.
You have my sword.
And you have my bow.
And my ax.
You carry the fates of us all, little one.
If this is indeed the will of the Council...... then Gondor will see it done.
- Frodo' s not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...... even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not.
We' re coming too!
You' il have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.
Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of...... mission.
Quest.
Thing.
Well, that rules you out, Pip.
Nine companions.
So be it.
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.
Great!
Where are we going?
My old sword!
Sting.
Take it.
- It' s so light.
Made by the Elves, you know.
The blade glows blue when Orcs are close.
And it' s times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful.
Here' s a pretty thing.
Mithril.
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.
Let me see you put it on.
My old ring.
I should very much like...... to hold it again, one last time.
I' m sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.
I' m sorry that you must carry this burden.
I' m sorry for everything.
We must hold to this course, west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.
Good!
Very good.
Move your feet.
- Thanks.
Faster!
If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they' re not...... I' d say we were taking the long way 'round.
Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria.
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.
No, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.
Get him!
- Hold him.
You' ve got my arm!
- Nothing.
It' s just a wisp of cloud.
It' s moving fast.
Against the wind.
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hurry!
- Take cover!
Spies of Saruman.
The passage south is being watched.
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.
It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt...... over so small a thing.
Such a little thing.
Give the Ring to Frodo.
As you wish.
I care not.
So, Gandalf, you tried to lead them over Caradhras.
And if that fails, where then will you go?
If the mountain defeats you...... will you risk a more dangerous road?
There is a fell voice on the air.
It' s Saruman!
He' s trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!
No!
We must get off the mountain!
Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city!
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.
You fear to go into those mines.
The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.
You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad- dûm:
Shadow and flame.
Let the Ring- bearer decide.
We will go through the mines.
So be it.
The walls...... of Moria.
Well, let' s see.
Ithildin.
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.
It reads, "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.
- What do you suppose that means?
It' s simple.
If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open.
Mines are no place for a pony.
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye- bye, Bill.
Go on, Bill.
Don' t worry, Sam, he knows the way home.
Do not disturb the water.
Oh, it' s useless.
It' s a riddle.
"Speak 'friend' and enter."
What' s the Elvish word for "friend"?
Mellon.
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.
And they call it a mine.
A mine!
This is no mine.
It' s a tomb.
Goblins.
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.
Get out!
- Get off him!
Into the mines!
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!
Run!
We now have but one choice.
We must face the long dark of Moria.
Be on your guard.
There are older and fouler things than Orcs...... in the deep places of the world.
Quietly now.
It' s a four- day journey to the other side.
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.
I have no memory of this place.
- No.
- I think we are.
- Gandalf' s thinking.
- Merry?
- What?
I' m hungry.
- There' s something down there.
- It' s Gollum.
- He' s been following us for three days.
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dûr?
- Escaped...... or was set loose.
He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself.
He will never be rid of his need for it.
It' s a pity Bilbo didn' t kill him when he had the chance.
It is pity that stayed Bilbo' s hand.
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.
Can you give it to them, Frodo?
Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment.
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.
My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill...... before this is over.
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.
I wish the Ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.
There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
In which case, you also were meant to have it.
And that is an encouraging thought.
It' s that way.
- He' s remembered.
But the air doesn' t smell so foul down here.
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.
Let me risk a little more light.
Behold...... the great realm and Dwarf- city of Dwarrowdelf.
There' s an eye opener, and no mistake.
"Here lies Balin...... son of Fundin...... Lord of Moria."
He is dead, then.
It' s as I feared.
We must move on.
We cannot linger.
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.
We have barred the gates...... but cannot hold them for long.
The ground shakes.
Drums...... drums in the deep.
We cannot get out.
A Shadow moves in the dark.
We cannot get out.
They are coming. "
Fool of a Took!
Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity.
Orcs.
Stay close to Gandalf!
They have a cave- troll.
Let them come!
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.
I think I' m getting the hang of this.
Oh, no.
He' s alive.
I' m all right.
I' m not hurt.
You should be dead.
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.
I think there' s more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.
Mithril.
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.
To the Bridge of Khazad- dûm!
What is this new devilry?
A Balrog.
A demon of the ancient world.
This foe is beyond any of you.
Run!
Quickly!
Lead them on, Aragorn.
The bridge is near.
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.
Not the beard!
Steady.
Hold on!
Hang on!
Lean forward!
Steady.
Over the bridge!
Fly!
You cannot pass!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
Go back to the Shadow.
You shall not pass!
Fly, you fools!
No!
Legolas, get them up.
Give them a moment, for pity' s sake!
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with Orcs.
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.
Come, Boromir.
Gimli, get them up.
On your feet, Sam.
Stay close, young Hobbits!
They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods.
An Elf- witch...... of terrible power.
All who look upon her...... fall under her spell.
And are never seen again.
Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.
You bring great evil here, Ring- bearer.
Well, here' s one Dwarf she won' t ensnare so easily.
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.
The Dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.
Haldir of Lorien.
We come here for help.
We need your protection.
Aragorn, these woods are perilous.
We should go back.
You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood.
You cannot go back.
Come.
She is waiting.
Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell.
Tell me, where is Gandalf?
For I much desire to speak with him.
He has fallen into Shadow.
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.
Stray but a little and it will fail...... to the ruin of all.
Yet hope remains while the Company is true.
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...... for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.
Tonight, you will sleep...
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...... one who has seen the Eye!
A lament for Gandalf.
What do they say about him?
I have not the heart to tell you.
For me, the grief is still too near.
Take some rest.
These borders are well- protected.
I will find no rest here.
I heard her voice inside my head.
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.
She said to me, "Even now there is hope left."
But I cannot see it.
It is long since we had any hope.
... and our people lose faith.
He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it.
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?
The White Tower of Ecthelion.
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.
Have you ever been called home...... by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?
I have seen the White City...... long ago.
One day, our paths will lead us there.
And the tower guard shall take up the call:
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."
Will you look into the mirror?
What will I see?
For the mirror...... shows many things.
Things that were...... things that are...... and some things...
... that have not yet come to pass.
I know what it is you saw.
For it is also in my mind.
It is what will come to pass if you should fail.
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.
He will try to take the Ring.
You know of whom I speak.
One by one, it will destroy them all.
If you ask it of me...... I will give you the One Ring.
You offer it to me freely.
I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.
In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen...... not dark but beautiful, and terrible as the dawn!
Treacherous as the sea!
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!
All shall love me...... and despair.
I pass the test.
-... and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.
You are a Ring- bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...... is to be alone.
This task was appointed to you.
And if you do not find a way...... no one will.
Then I know what I must do.
It' s just...
... I' m afraid to do it.
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?
Taken by the Dark Powers...... tortured and mutilated.
And now...... perfected.
My fighting Uruk- hai...... whom do you serve?
Saruman!
Hunt them down.
Do not stop until they are found.
You do not know fear.
You will taste Man- flesh!
One of the halflings carries something of great value.
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.
Kill the others.
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.
I give you the light of Eärendil...... our most beloved star.
May it be a light for you in dark places...... when all other lights go out.
The Argonath.
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.
My kin.
Hide the boats and continue on foot.
- We approach Mordor from the North.
Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil...... an impassable labyrinth of razor- sharp rocks.
And after that, it gets even better.
Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see.
That is our road.
I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.
Recover my...
- We should leave now.
- No.
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.
A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.
Something draws near.
I can feel it.
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.
Where' s Frodo?
None of us should wander alone.
You, least of all.
So much depends on you.
I know why you seek solitude.
You suffer.
I see it day by day.
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?
There are other ways, Frodo.
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.
It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.
Warning?
Against what?
We' re all afraid, Frodo.
-... don' t you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!
- lf you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.
I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.
What chance do you think you have?
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.
And you will beg for death before the end!
You fool!
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.
It should be mine!
Give it to me!
- Give it to me!
- No.
I see your mind.
You will take the Ring to Sauron!
You will betray us!
You' il go to your death, and the death of us all!
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!
What have I done?
Please, Frodo.
Frodo, I' m sorry!
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?
Stay away!
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?
Would you destroy it?
I would have gone with you to the end.
Into the very fires of Mordor.
I know.
Look after the others.
Especially Sam.
He will not understand.
Go, Frodo!
Run.
Find the halfling!
Aragorn, go!
Quick!
Come on!
What' s he doing?
He' s leaving.
- No!
Run, Frodo.
Go on!
Hey, you!
- Over here!
- This way!
- It' s working!
Run!
- The horn of Gondor.
Run!
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.
Where is Frodo?
I let Frodo go.
Then you did what I could not.
I tried to take the Ring from him.
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.
I did not see it.
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.
You fought bravely.
You have kept your honor.
Leave it.
It is over.
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...... and my city to ruin.
I do not know what strength is in my blood...... but I swear to you, I will not let the White City fall...... nor our people fail.
Our people.
I would have followed you, my brother.
My captain.
My king.
Be at peace...... son of Gondor.
I wish the Ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such times...... but that is not for them to decide.
All you have to decide...... is what to do with the time that is given to you.
Frodo, no!
- No, Sam.
Go back, Sam!
- I' m going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.
And I' m coming with you!
You can' t swim!
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.
A promise:
"Don' t you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don' t mean to.
I don' t mean to.
Come on.
Hurry!
Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo' s fate is no longer in our hands.
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.
Not if we hold true to each other.
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death.
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.
We travel light.
Let us hunt some Orc.
I hope the others find a safer road.
Strider will look after them.
I don' t suppose we' il ever see them again.
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.
We may.
... I' m glad you are with me.
Sorry, man.
I know this hurts.
Michael told me you pulled the bullet out with your bare hands.
You have to show me how to do that sometime.
Where is she?
- What?
I didn' t -- - Where is she?
You mean Kate?
She' s been watching over you for the past 24 hours straight.
The only way I could get rid of her was to send her out to get some food for you.
I love her.
Well, hey, girl.
What are you doin 'here?
Hey, there.
All right, let' s get you to bed.
Watch your step, watch your step!
What the hell is that smell?
- Probably your breath.
- Yeah, right.
Come on.
You' re beautiful.
Hey.
Hey!
I just gave you a compliment.
Yeah, I heard you.
Aren' t ya gonna take my pants off first?
You are beautiful.
Good night.
Coffee, pie?
Both?
How about a beer?
I' d like to see some I. D.
I' m 24, ma.
You want to ride around on that death trap of yours without a helmet,
I' m not going to help your cause by getting you drunk.
How' s that wrist?
What, this?
You know, that shelf in the kitchen sticks out sometimes.
You' d think I' d remember it was there, but I banged it --
Don' t.
I made my bed, Katherine.
Well, your bed' s gone, ma.
What?
What is this?
An insurance policy for the house.
- What?
I never -- - I took it out in your name.
What did you do?
Does Wayne know about this?
Just remember that you were here and you didn' t see me, okay?
Katherine, what did you do?
I took care of you, ma.
I gotta go.
You' re not gonna see me for awhile.
Katherine!
What did you do?
Katherine!
- Hey.
- Hey.
You okay?
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, I think I' m just...
I think I' m tired.
How is he?
Fever' s still up there.
Can' t tell if the antibiotics are working.
It' il help to get some food in him.
You should get down to the beach for... for Shannon.
I was actually thinking that I should stay and watch Sawyer.
I' il stay with him.
You should be there.
Keep him hydrated.
Maybe mash upsome of that fruit, see if you can get him to eat it.
And everybody will beat the beach, so don' t forget the button.
I got it.
Be back in a couple hours.
Yep.
You sure you' re okay?
Yeah, I' m great.
Hey.
I' m going to go to the funeral.
I don' t think I' m gonna make it.
I think most of them realize it was an accident.
Shannon and I were strangers.
We never would have met if...
we wouldn' t even have spoken if...
but we did meet, and we did speak.
At least...
I loved her.
May she rest in peace.
You hungry?
I' m just gonna mash you up some fruit here.
When you wake up, you' re going to get a kick out of me feeding you like a baby.
I saw a horse.
Yeah.
That' s what happens when you don' t sleep.
Sawyer?
You awake?
Good for nothing...
You killed me.
Why did you kill me?!
It' s the alarm.
Kate!
Kate!
Sawyer.
- What happened?
- I don' t know.
- But you said -- - I don' t know, John!
Well, where' s Kate?
Kate.
Hey, you missed the funeral.
Yeah, uh, I was with Sawyer.
Oh, right.
A few of them came, the new people.
Not her, the one who killed Shannon.
That would have been awkward.
They seem to have had a rough time of it.
Looks like they went bloody "lord of the flies" out there.
You haven' t listened to a word I' ve said.
Do you think there are horses here?
What?
I think I saw a horse in the jungle.
I' ve seen polar bears.
I' ve seen monsters.
Well, heard monsters.
But horses?
No.
Kate!
Where are you going?
Tallahassee, one way, please.
Tallahassee?
I spent a week in Tallahassee one night.
It' s all strip malls and waffle houses.
What' s a pretty girl like you gonna do down in Tallahassee?
I' m sure I' il find something.
Bet you got family down there, huh?
Actually, I' m just visiting.
Hey.
Hey!
Don' t I know you?
No, I don' t think so.
Don' t run, Kate.
I got her.
Kate Austen, you' re under arrest for murder.
- I didn' t do anything.
- Oh, yeah, you did.
Your mama gave you up, Kate.
Charlie, have you seen Kate?
Uh, a little while ago in the jungle.
She was acting kind of balmy, asking me about horses on the island.
You know where she is now?
She' s on the path heading back to the caves.
Everything okay?
Yeah, Charlie, everything' s fine.
Thank you.
Free at last, huh?
Looks good.
Hey, Locke.
What' s up with the blast doors?
Blast doors?
Yeah.
Like in case of an explosion, they' il come from the ceiling.
That guy down here, uh...
Desmond?
Yeah, Desmond.
He didn' t tell you about these, what they' re for?
No, no, he didn' t, but he did leave a movie.
A movie?
Yeah.
You want to see it?
I would like to see it, too.
If you don' t mind.
Why not?
The more, the merrier.
Kate, what the hell are you doing out here?
What happened in the hatch, Kate?
Why' d you leave?
I find Sawyer just lying on the ground.
You just took off.
- Is he okay?
- Yes, Kate, he' s fine.
I' m sorry.
Are you?
Yeah, I' m sorry.
I' m sorry that I am not as perfect as you!
I' m sorry that I' m not as good!
- What' s going on with you?
- Just forget it.
No, don' t walk away from me, no.
Don' t!
- Kate!
Kate, Kate, Kate.
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
Kate.
This place... this place is crazy.
I can' t.
It' s driving me nuts.
I know.
It' s okay.
It' s all right.
It' s all right.
All right?
Kate!

On behalf of the Degroots,
Alvar Hanso and all of us at the Dharma Initiative, thank you, namaste, and good luck.
All right.
So you' ve been pushing that button every two hours since you got down here.
That' s right.
How' s that even work?
I' ve set up 2- person shifts, 6 hours.
Everyone' s on the roster.
Don' t they want to know why?
I think the film is pretty self- explanatory.
Really?
All I heard was something about electromagnets and an incident.
What about all the missing pieces?
Oh, you mean the splices?
Yeah, just a frame here and there, I think, nothing important.
What do you think?
About the film, what do you think?
I' m sorry I missed it, her funeral.
I had to be with Sawyer, so...
Why aren' t you with him now?
'Cause I' m going crazy.
Do you believe in ghosts, Sayid?
I saw Walt in the jungle just before Shannon was shot.
Does that make me crazy?
It' s a long drive back to the arraignment.
You comfy?
Why now?
What?
Nice corn- fed farm girl like yourself, no history of violence, straight A' s, no record, a couple of speeding tickets.
I just gotta wonder, why' d you kill him now?
Oh, right, yeah, don' t tell me.
You wouldn' t want to incriminate yourself, not after you were so smart planning it.
That jury back in Iowa sure ain' t gonna get hung upon premeditation.
And a gas leak?
Come on, it' s amateur hour from top to bottom.
It sounds like you' ve got it all figured out.
I do have you all figured out.
You don' t know anything about me.
White- trash mom divorces dad, starts up with some guy who' s a drinker, maybe he knocks her around a little bit, and so she marries him because, you know, that' s what happens.
And then this drunk, this Wayne, he moves into your house, and you get to lay there every night and listen to him doing your mom right there in your daddy' s old bedroom.
And even that wouldn' t be so bad if he didn' t beat her up all the time.
But she loves him, she defends him.
If that don' t make a person want to kill somebody, I don' t know what does.
But the question is, now?
Why now?
Why after all these years did you just decide to blow poor Wayne up?
He come knocking on your door late at night?
He never touched me.
Look out!
Get... get off!
Well, why can' t you just put the numbers in now?
No, it doesn' t work that way.
The alarm goes off in four minutes.
You mind if I check out some of this hardware?
Sure.
Just don' t break it.
- Hello again.
- Hello.
If you don' t mind, I will begin at the beginning.
Long before Christ, the king of Judah was a man named Josiah.
Boy, when you say "beginning," you mean beginning.
At that time, the temple where the people worshipped was in ruin, and so the people worshipped idols, false gods, and so the kingdom was in disarray.
Josiah, since he was a good king, sent his secretary to the treasury and said, "we must rebuild the temple.
Give all of the gold to the workers so that this will be done. "
But when the secretary returned, he had no gold.
And when Josiah asked why this was, the secretary replied...
"we found a book."
Do you know this story?
No, afraid I don' t.
What the secretary had found was an ancient book, the book of law.
You may know it as the Old Testament.
And it was with that ancient book, not with the gold, that Josiah rebuilt the temple.
On the other side of the island, we found a place much like this.
And in this place, we found a book.
I believe what' s inside there will be of great value to you.
Hey.
So Rose' s husband' s white.
Didn' t see that one coming.
Is there something you need, Hurley?
No.
Just taking a walk, thought I' d say "hey."
Who' s taking care of Sawyer?
Sun is.
So you' re, like, mad at him?
Why would I be mad at Sawyer?
Maybe 'cause he' s the one always comes down here and chops wood and now you are.
It' s, like, transference.
What are you, a shrink now?
Well, that' s what they call it in the mental hospital.
I' m not mad at anyone.
Where' s Jack?
I don' t know.
He didn' t come back.
Has he said anything?
Sawyer?
No, he' s still sleeping.
Can you watch him?
- I can stay if you -- - No.
Yeah, I can.
Thanks.
Uh- huh.
I' il send one over to you, right.
I' il call you back later.
Hi, dad.
Katie, the police and the U. S. Marshals are looking for you.
You shouldn' t have come here.
I' ve been waiting outside for 2 hours.
They' re not here.
Is it true what they' re saying?
Katie, what did you come here for?
Why didn' t you tell me, dad?
Tell you what?
I was making a scrapbook, a surprise for your birthday, so I called one of your C. O. s to get some pictures of you in uniform.
The pictures that he sent me had dates on the back, photos of you in Korea up until four months before I was born.
Why didn' t you tell me that Wayne was my father?
Why?
I didn' t tell you because I knew you' d kill him.
loved him.
You were 5 years old.
I wanted to take you along with me.
She wouldn' t let me.
So why didn' t you kill him?
Because I don' t have murder in my heart.
I' m gonna have to call 'em.
Can I have an hour?
Bye, daddy.
Can you hear me?
Sawyer?
Wayne?
I' m probably crazy, and this doesn' t matter,
but maybe you' re in there.
Somehow you asked me a question.
You asked me why I... why I did it.
It wasn' t 'cause you drove my father away or the way you looked at me or because you beat her.
It was' cause I hated that you were a part of me, that I would never be good, that I would never have anything good.
I see you, Wayne, and it makes me sick.
That' s about the sweetest thing I' ve ever heard.
Sawyer?
Who the hell is Wayne?
Where am I?
A bunk bed?
Yeah, you' re in a bunk bed.
Are we saved?
No, Sawyer.
Not yet.
Voilà.
What are the odds?
- The odds?
- Yeah.
Here, hold this down on the table here, nice and flat.
I mean, think about it.
Somebody made this film.
Someone else cut this piece out.
We crash.
Two halves of the same plane fall on different parts of the island.
You' re over there.
I' m over here.
And now here' s the missing piece, right back where it belongs.
What are the odds?
Don' t mistake coincidence for fate.
You' ve gotta be kidding me.
Air lock' s over this way.
Oh.
Come on, admit it.
We' ve been rescued.
You got it?
Sorry.
Watch yourself.
Son of a bitch.
Watch yourself, okay?
Okay.
Home sweet home.
Yeah.
I really thought you were yanking my chain.
What do you keep smiling at?
You need a haircut.
Oh, really?
Maybe you ought to take me back inside.
You see that?
If you mean the big- ass horse standing in the middle of the jungle, then, yeah.
You know that horse, freckles?
Yeah, I do.
Tequila and tonic.
That' s your drink, right?
Where' s the tonic?
We' re running a little low on mixers.
Sure you want to waste that on me?
I figured you could use a drink.
I know I could.
You' re gonna try to convince me that everyone here doesn' t hate me?
Only if you' re gonna try to convince me that every woman in the world' s not crazy.

Operation Big Drip is cresting Level Two.
I need him now.
No, no, don' t put me on hold!

Hello, my name' s Jimmy Tong and I was wondering if there' s anything I could say that would convince you to have lunch with me.
Oh, Jimmy, you' re so cute.
Let' s go back to your apartment and make like... donkey.
You got me nervous again.
It' s just a salesgirl.
To you... but, to me...
I dream of her before I ever saw her.
Shh.
Go tell her that.
That line.
Listen.
My name is Jimmy Tong.
When I see you, I have a wet dream.
Is that what I say?
No, no, you know... just ask her out to lunch now and later, we work out that line.
We be wasting time, man.
We have to drive.
And whatever you do, do not be yourself.
Just joking.
(sighs)
Thank you so much.
You' re welcome.
Good- bye.
I can do it.
My name' s Jimmy Tong.
Okay... (exhales)
Hi.
Hi.
Pretty colors.
Will you excuse me for just one moment?
Just between us guys... you don' t come around here for the art, do you?
Heh.
Let me, as owner of this gallery give you a little bit of friendly advice.
Don' t waste any time.
You go over there and you ask Jennifer out.
Yes.
That way, she can say no and we can get on with our little lives.
Thank you for your advice.
Hello.
My name Jimmy Tong.
What can I say to convince you to have lunch with me?
I' m sorry.
Are you hurt?
Come here, you little runt.
Hello.
Come here!
Where' d you go?
Where are you?
Sauerkraut?
Hey!
I just washed that car.
What the hell wrong with you, boy?
Want I jam this in your ass and break it?
Come down here.
Not too fast.
Hey, I just want to talk.
You do that.
Oh, you' re scared now.
Just- just go and get yourself some training wheels!
Go get a tattoo of a chicken!
I thought all your people know karate.
Not everybody Chinese is Bruce Lee.
Just calm yourself, eh, Jimmy, calm yourself.
Just not my day.
Do you think you can get me to 70 Fleming Street?
Of course.
Wait a second.
You Jimmy Tong?
That' s who I am.
Who are you?
The name is Steena.
So, how come you drive so fast?
More fares.
Is that why you had your license suspended nine times for speeding?
But no accidents.
Do you remember where I' m going?
70 Fleming.
Get me there before I finish putting on my makeup and I' il, uh, double the meter.
You serious?
Do I look like I have a sense of humor?
Okay.
Hurry, open the gate!
LAZY ASS!
OPEN THE GATES!
I' M ON MY COFFEE BREAK.
SHUT UP, OLD MAN!
IT' S JlMMY, YOU FOOL!
DON' T RUN OVER THE CHlCKENS!
You drive too fast!
Yeah, I got mascara and eyeliner left.
You got five blocks.
Don' t tell me you' re slowing down.
You know, you drive like an old woman.
You' re not scared, are you?
(honking) (tires screeching) (horns honking)
What do you think you' re doing?
Back off, buddy.
She' s mine.
Oh, it' s you, miss.
Well, you lived up to your reputation.
The job is yours.
A good one.
Oh, yeah?
How much do you make at this "good job"? $475 a week, plus tips.
So how would you like to make $2, 000 a week plus room and board?
When do I show up?
Tomorrow morning, 7: 00 a. m.
You' il be driving Clark Devlin, Mr. Tong.
Good day, miss.
Out of here!
Good morning, Mr. Tong.
You put your face on without me, huh?
Please have a seat.
Those are the house rules.
Memorize them.
Especially number one.
"Never talk directly to Mr. Devlin."
If you have any questions you' il find all the answers in there.
And, if I were you, I' d get rid of the mildew on the chin.
My soul patch?
Uh, yeah.
You like working for this Devlin guy?
I don' t work for him.
I' m not a professional driver, but I' d always believed that thing you' re staring into is designed for the monitoring of traffic, not passengers.
Am I wrong?
While I' m really enjoying our time together shall we try moving?
Wallace has been my partner for years. something' s happened to him.
He wouldn' t just disappear.
Now, you get your job done and find my partner.
So tell me how.
Why don' t you be intelligent?
I don' t understand what you' re talking about.
Well, why don' t you call me back when you do understand what I' m talking about.
Of course.
You have to take the surface street.
Sorry.
Did you get a copy of the rules?
Did you read them?
Jimmy, let me tell you something, my friend...
I hate the rules.
The lights are timed.
Thank you.
And, Jimmy... crank the music up.
Yes, sir.
C. S. A. HEADQUARTERS
I present to you Special Agent Wallace.
Deceased two days, 14 hours, five minutes... approximately.
Pretty interesting.
Now, why don' t you, uh, tell me a little about him?
Well, in simplest terms, he drowned in his bathtub.
Contusion here suggests he hit his head fell prone, unconscious.
The man infiltrated a Serbian death squad with not even a scratch.
He goes down in a bathtub?
Life' s a bitch.
You want to put him back in the fridge?
He didn' t drown, sir.
He was murdered.
Does that make life a little less bitchy?
And- and you would be?
That' s Del Blaine, sir.
She' s having a filter installed between her brain and mouth next week.
So you don' t think he drowned?
Well, sir, there was water in his lungs but the pulmonary vein was filled with collapsed platelets indicative of dehydration.
He died of thirst.
Thirst.
The mineral profile fit a high- end bottled water but what was really weird is that it contained a strain of bacteria that I, so far haven' t been able to culture.
Anyway, uh... didn' t mean to interrupt.
Ooh, the woman seems to know a lot about water.
She thinks she knows a lot about a lot of things.
You know, we have a special situation in the field.
I think we could use your talents.
You interested?
When do I start?
You ever hear of Clark Devlin?
Rumors and innuendo.
Del, I could tell you a thing or two about Clark Devlin.
Uh, you think we could keep our minds out of the gutter for about a second?
You might just become
WOMAN:
My contacts in Guatemala have what you' re looking for, I' m sure.
Good.
I' il take one of these beautiful Uticella marginalis.
Just gorgeous.
Now, you' re going to call me?
Is your phone number on file?
I' m having a bit of trouble with the phones at the moment.
It might be better if you dropped it off yourself.
It may take a while.
Well, why don' t you familiarize yourself with the route?
There' s a little gathering at my house tonight -- a fund- raiser for the Natural History Museum.
I would so love to have you.
(mouthing)
Should I send a car?
I drive myself.
Admirable.
Eight o' clock.
And, uh, be sure not to wear anything too distracting, or no one will get their checkbooks out.
How did you learn to be so smooth?
I' ve seen the way you drive.
You have the same instincts I do.
You lack confidence.
The girl in the art gallery' s not beyond you, you know.
You know about her?
Every time we leave the house we go by the art gallery and slow down.
You just need a little polish.
I' il never be a Clark Devlin.
Don' t tell anyone this, Jimmy, but there' s a lot less to Clark Devlin than meets the eye.
I' ve got a couple of good lines and a couple of very expensive suits.
Apart from that, we' re exactly the same.
How about a couple hundred million?
Trust me... 90% of it is clothes.
The other ten percent?
The other ten percent' s in there.
You' ve got plenty of it.
Yeah?
Can I stop wearing my hat?
All right.
Thank you.
No, just stay smooth.
Thank you.
Steena, Devlin.
This driver, this Jimmy, I like him.
Let' s get him a proper suit.
Something sexy.
You pick it out.
All right.
Always a delight talking to you, too, darling.
Home, James.
Absolutely, Mr. Devlin.
Watch your step.
Thank you, sir.
This definitely not a rental.
My name' s Clark Devlin.
Would you like to dance?
Would you like to dance?
Admirable.
There is just one rule.
Never touch my tuxedo.
I didn' t.
Good.
Don' t.
Yes, sir.
Get the car.
Let' s go for dinner.
Yes, sir.
What' il you have?
Anything.
All right.
Two large fries, extra well- done.
That' s it.
Your order' s ready.
Pull forward.
That' s pretty quick.
Anything else?
DEVLlN:
I' il have a personal pizza, crispy crust.
They don' t serve pizza at Burger...
New item, huh?
Do you have chicken chow mein?
Thank you.
It' s a drive- through.
Let' s drive.
Watch out!
Watch it, man!
Sorry, pal.
Let' s go.
Why are we running away from a skateboard?
I think it' s probably a bomb.
I thought you said a bomb.
What do you mean, a bomb?
No good.
Out!
Move!
Jimmy, you okay?
I' m fine.
You okay, boss?
Yeah.
Yeah, all in a day' s work, eh?
You got any aspirin?
Who did this to you?
Water stri...
Walter Strider -- he' s the one?
Wat... er... stri...
Walter Strider.
No... no police.
His name is...
Trust nobody.
Uh... his name is...
Brad Dillford.
Wear it.
Boss!
Hold on, boss.
Give me the clipboard.
I' il take care of you.
Wa... stri...
- Sir!
Okay.
I will find Walter Strider.
I' m sorry.
I promise.
What do you want my mother' s maiden name for?
Last time she was in here, I was born.
I' m sure my dad had something to do with it at least I hope so.
WOMAN (singsongy):
Dr. Angela.
Where is Dr. Angelo?
Are you Dr. Angela?
There' s no smoking in a hospital.
I was nervous.
How is he?
He might be here a while.
You might want to get him some things from home in case he comes to.
He had this clutched in his hand.
I don' t know if it means anything.
I do need Dr. Angelo.
Dr. Angelo is on holiday today.
- Yeah.
MAN:
I' il tell you, I' m pretty excited.
I mean, nervous, but I' m excited.
I' m pumped, you know.
I knew I was doing good work for Banning international but I didn' t know Mr. Banning would be taking so much notice of me so soon.
I won' t be having my headquarters in the bottom of a boat, you know what I mean?
Why did you choose Mr. Lundeen?
He questioned my growth projections.
No, that' s not it.
I don' t like his hair.
Mr. Banning.
So, word filtered down to me that you don' t share my optimism about our company' s future.
Oh, no.
Drink?
Oh, yes, thank you.
I just felt that to meet your projections, pretty much every person on Earth would have to drink only Banning Springs water.
Yes, indeed.
Water, Mr. Lundeen, comprises 60% of your body.
Don' t you find it incredible that two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom can combine to create something so beautiful so useful, so essential?
I find water to be miraculous.
Do you think I' m silly?
Not at all.
Yes.
You' re helping me out by being a guinea pig for a new product.
Oh, I see.
What a brilliant idea.
Water that makes you thirsty.
What' s in it?
Salt?
There' s no profundity in salt.
Bacteria.
Once ingested its DNA will instruct your cells' cytoplasm to spill electrolytes into your bloodstream causing dehydration.
It' s virulent but, unfortunately, it' s too fast.
Way too fast.
As we speak, your internal organs are shriveling.
Well, as dry as your limited imagination.
Gentlemen, fetch the vacuum, won' t you?
Thank you.
Schiffer, Schwartzkopf, Sondheim, Springsteen...
No Strider.
Welcome to the Tactical Uniform Experiment.
Tuxedo recognizing new user.
Mapping user' s neurological structure.
Activate wristwatch for desired function.
Demo...
Okay, show me.
Uh- oh.
Caution -- demolition mode.
The Tuxedo will consider any object a target and act to destroy it.
Oh, what' s happening?
Exit the demolition mode immediately.
(crashing) (whimpers)
Burn, baby, burn... (beeping) (frightened whimpering) (beep)
Mr. Devlin, is everything all right?
I think Mr. Devlin wants you to clean his room tomorrow.
It' s a little bit messy.
I think he threw the party.
No.
Maybe after he leaves.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
Are we on?
Are we on what?
C. S. A. OPERATlONS
What?
What accent?
You' re the senior officer.
I' il play it however you want.
Deitrich Banning is holding a meeting with water CEOs.
The Agency wants us to find out what he' s planning.
Wh- What about Walter Strider?
Who is he?
You tell me.
Okay.
So, we will meet tomorrow.
I' il be wearing a gray suit.
Your code is "nice rack."
I' il respond
"I forgot my bra."
That passes for humor around here.
10: 00, V- 15.
What' s the cross street?
Very funny.
May I join you?
Uh, yeah.
Nice rack.
Hello.
Mr. Devlin, there' s been a change of plans.
But I' m here already.
Where are you?
Don' t get all pissy about it.
They just told me, so I' m telling you.
We' il meet tonight 8: 00, Pier 17, base of the silo and... forget the password.
Oh, now you tell me.
Oh, hey, there he is.
I got to go.
Get him!
Stop!
Get back here, you creep!
So, we' ve got five minutes to get into position.
I secured the rooftop.
The equipment' s good to go and I just have to say it is such an honor to be working with the legendary...
Clark Devlin?
I' m Del Blaine.
Have we met before?
No.
Good.
Okay, Del Blaine, let' s do what we' ve come here to do.
I' il follow you.
Ladies first.
Okay.
A couple of details changed from what was in the file.
You read it?
The files are crap.
Give me the short version.
Deitrich Banning' s holding a meeting of international water company CEOs.
We think he' s trying to force them into selling their companies to him.
Huh?
I' m thinking.
That is, until last week.
Wallace calls us on his cell phone to tell us that the operation had reached critical mass and, suddenly, wham!
As you requested, a Klineholtz bolt- action nine- millimeter titanium folding stock with 20- time infrared sniper- scope and counterweighted micro- rifled barrel.
My favorite gun.
But I don' t kill people anymore.
You' re planting a bug.
It was all in that "crap" file.
Go look through your binoculars.
(beeping)
They' re arriving.
Ready?
It' s critical we get a listening device in Banning' s meeting.
Range -- 962 feet.
Aim for the briefcase.
Should be a piece of cake for you, sir.
You kind of missed.
In the year 2001 $35 billion worth of bottled water was consumed worldwide.
Today, bottled water costs more per gallon than gasoline.
We, my friends, are the new oil barons.
We at Banning Springs have developed a new filtration process that would protect your assets against the biological holocaust that' s coming.
Looks like we got company.
CSA would be my bet.
You' ve heard what I have to say.
Now I' d like to hear you.
How much is this plan going to cost us?
It won' t cost you a penny, out of pocket.
All I ask is to become your slightly- more - than- equal partner.
But to use it, they' ve got to give him half of their companies?
He' s trying to muscle these guys into selling their companies to him.
Something about everyone being defenseless against more deadly forms of bacteria.
Do you want to listen to this?
What do you think that means, sir?
Del Blaine!
Yeah, I' il be there in a minute.
Yeah, I' d really like some help up here, sir.
Del Blaine!
DEL:
I know this is not near as exciting as most of your missions, but could you humor me with just a little professionalism?
I would really love some help...
What are you doing?
What' s with the jumpy- jumpy?
- What?
- Your headphones!
Okay, Chapter Six of the training manual.
Unarmed assailant -- frontal attack.
Begin!
Stomach, head!
What' s my name?!
Yeah!
You okay?
Where the hell have you been?!
Stop pushing!
Aah, my hand!
Not bad.
Sir, are you okay, sir?
Don' t!
You' re- you' re- you' re ripping... my sl- sleeve!
No, not, not my... (screaming)
Sir!
Oh, my...
This was not... part of the plan.
Del Blaine?
Confidence.
Nice of you, moron.
Not in the manual.
Creep!
Del Blaine!
Get off of me!
Why didn' t you stop?
God, what the hell is wrong with you?!
How do you... fall off a building and end up... uh...
- (panting) (rhythmic breathing)
Would you stop that?
It' s okay.
I am in the car with a psychopath.
We are not safe.
Are you upset?
Why would I be upset?
I' ve always wanted to begin and end my career with a big fat failure!
Thank you very much, Mr. Devlin.
It' s my first time.
I mean... every mission is like my first time.
It' s so difficult being Clark Devlin.
Sorry.
I didn' t do that.
What... i- is wrong with you?!
I' m not who you think I am.
Stay away!
I' m a little over- amped myself right now.
Get some rest and medication.
What?
We' il be in communication.
I don' t have your phone number!
DEL:
Who am I kidding?
I have no idea what I' m doing or why I' m doing it.
I felt the same way when I took my first field assignment.
Then I met Clark Devlin and life just got a whole lot better... and a little more complicated.
MAN 2:
Just hit the second button there.
Everybody warned me, he was unorthodox but he' s way irrational, bordering on nutso.
There, yeah.
Look at that.
Move it over, over just a bit.
He' s getting under your skin, isn' t he?
He got under my skin once and I' m still feeling it.
Yeah, you told me.
What about his English?
Oh, I can never understand half of what he says but don' t you just love his accent?
She can' t hear anything from here...?
No, I don' t think...
God, I wish I was still back in the field.
How do you like me now?
She' s got issues, man.
Can your, uh, can your girlfriend shoot, uh...
A groin out of a target?
Let' s get our nails done.
Have a nice day, boys.
WOMAN (singsongy, over P. A.):
Dr. Angelo, Dr. Angelo...
They ran out of "Get well soon."
You said to wear this, but I don' t know.
Being Clark Devlin is not easy.
Hello.
So, Mr. Devlin how are you feeling today?
Not so good, I' m afraid.
Well, you' ve got a few hours to pull yourself together.
What do you mean?
After the fiasco of planting the bug
I' d say we have only one choice:
Level One surveillance.
In other words...
Infiltration.
Banning' s going to be at the Lanford Hotel tonight entertaining three of his new partners.
Chalmers has agreed to... get us at the next table.
Is this a black- tie event?
But I' m sure you' il wear whatever you want.
Maybe we can find Walter Strider.
Meet you there at 8: 00.
What?
Water...
(muffled):
- Huh?
Uh, he needs help.
Security!
I know how partial you are to that monkey suit of yours so I got gussied up.
Good job.
You gussy very well.
Hmm?
Thank you.
Sorry, I don' t have anything for you.
It' s a video camera.
Act normal.
We don' t want everybody to know.
Sorry.
Good evening.
Uh, name, please.
Lincoln.
(chuckling)
Washington.
You' re a billionaire and you try to grease the guy with seven bucks?
You think I have money to throw away?
You on the list?
Perfect.
No.
I' ve got a T- 135 disorientation module.
You just stand there.
Could you... hold this for me?
Aw, thanks.
Now, where did I put those tickets?
What' s happening, Snowman?
What' s happening?
What' s happening, Snowman?
I can' t believe it.
James Brown.
The Godfather of Soul.
Mr. Brown.
Forgive us for bothering you.
We came to see your show and...
Yeah, she forgot to make reservations.
I can get tickets for the front row for you.
Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Brown.
The things work out.
There' s one more thing I' d like to say, um...
It' s not the in thing today to give compliments to a young lady but I just got to let you know that... you got a nice rack.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Brown.
Enjoy the show.
- (gasps) is wrong with you?!
He f- fell down by himself.
You killed James Brown.
No, he' s fine.
And Banning is going to leave.
Don' t panic.
Oh, my God.
Are you... praying?
Miss Cleo told me this would happen. $4. 99- a- minute Miss Cleo?
Just go out and tell them
Mr. Brown is not here.
Nice to meet you.
And right about now, it is style time!
(audience whooping)
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Dynamite...
James Brown!
What' s going on?!
Mr. James Brown will not be appearing tonight... (audience groaning) due to unforeseen circumstances but stay right where you are because the Lanford Hotel is really proud to present the Last Emperor of Soul.
And, um, well, here he is.
Hi, everybody.
Good evening.
How are you tonight?!
MAN:
Who wants to get funky tonight?!
Go ahead and make it funky.
Good God!
(derisive groan)
I was blending; that' s what agents do.
Would you please stop?
Whoa!
Hey, slut, thanks.
I hate celebrities who brush off their fans.
Banning' s girlfriend has been drinking.
Okay, she might be able to tell -- Clark!
Yes.
Get on the scene, Sex Machine.
Hi.
Good evening.
Hello.
Well, we' re all vaguely honored you could join us, I suppose.
Singing is my favorite type of music.
Oh, admirable.
Regrettably, this is my vacuous fiancee.
I think her name is Cheryl something.
Oh, charmed.
Do you ever dance unprofessionally...
Emperor?
Let' s see what I can do.
Oh, excuse us.
Of course.
Do you know how to mambo?
I hope so.
Hmm... '92 Dasani.
Gentle bouquet with a hint of vinyl polychloride.
Earthy yet... ethereal.
Cheers.
I spilled.
You and Banning seem very close.
Tell me about his work.
I don' t want to talk about him.
I want to talk about you.
You' re such a handsome devil.
So are you.
I step into my laboratory and I play.
It' s not work, you see.
It' s glorious wet... play.
Well, maybe I can come over and play.
That would be very nice.
The thing is, I, uh...
I have a small problem... trusting people.
I don' t know if I can trust myself with you, Deitrich.
Well, maybe we can come up with a way for you to pro...
Her name' s Del Blaine.
She' s CSA.
Oh, bloody hell.
He drives a BMW, registered to Clark Devlin.
You told me you dealt with Devlin with the skateboard bomb.
Yeah, well, he looks pretty alive to me.
He' s all over Cheryl.
You want me to do something about that?
Maybe the rancid tart might actually be of some use for once.
Get the boys, would you?
I am so bushed.
I' m sorry, you' il have to excuse me.
Unfortunate interruptus.
So, my long streak of love, here is the key to the hospitality suite should you feel the need to spend the night.
Good- bye.
Well, I think I' il just go up to room 7- 2 -- excuse me -- 6- 8 and take a long, hot bath in room 7- 2- 6- 8.
Good night.
And once again, we end up with nothing.
I can get her to talk.
And say what?
Oh, Emperor, would you sign my bra?
Oops, I' m not wearing one.
(giggles)
What is it with you and bras?
Oh, right, and that' s why you have to go up to her hotel room.
You have never seen my work.
This is what Clark Devlin does best.
Can I go home?
No, you have to cover me.
With what, a shot of penicillin?
Huh?
Fine.
I' il be waiting by the pool.
Oh, wait.
(ditzy voice):
7- 2- 6- 8.
Cheryl!
You' il never find...
What kind of bubbles do you like?
As long as you live... or big?!
Hang it for me, will you?
I know you can dance, but... what else can you do?
Get on the bed.
Okay, Mr. Devlin, let' s see your magic.
Oh, my God, your hands are like a machine.
Oh, I am never working with him again.
So, tell me about Deitrich' s good friend, Walter Strider.
Oh!
Never heard of him... but I know Dry Martini.
Maybe someone should mix us a couple.
Y- O- U spells "you."
You' re smart.
Really?
And a good speller.
(giggling)
I graduated top two- thirds of my sixth grade class.
What a gentleman.
Look, it' s Cocktail Barbie.
I- I like my clothes on.
Kinky boy.
Where did you get that pin?
Oh.
Want to have a closer look?
I' m sorry.
Look at the time.
I got to go.
Oh, Emperor.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
Oh, Emperor.
Oh, where are you going you naughty boy?
I adore romance when it' s rough.
(angry grunt)
Get back here!
Come on!
Take a bath.
Oh, yes, because I' ve been a dirty, dirty girl.
Go fill the tub.
Do you like it with bubbles?
Hot bubbles.
Tiny bubbles in my wine...
Makes me feel fine
Come on, her voice reminds me of my mother.
CHERYL:
(beeping) (grunting)
What' s happening?
What' s going on under those cute little boxers of yours?
Emperor, the bubbles are perfect.
Come to mama, Emperor!
Coming!
Help!
(screaming) (whirring and beeping)
Say good night... agent!
Del Blaine.
(whirring and beeping)
Sorry.
I need my bathroom bud.
She' s in there taking a bath.
What happened to your nose?
Sorry!
Honeymooners.
Yes, some things never change.
Emperor, come back!
Please!
Get going.
Can' t you do anything?
Why are you so mad?
Gee, let me think.
Because big, ugly men are trying to kill me?
Because I got stuck with a millionaire playboy dilettante for a partner?
You don' t care how you make people feel.
I happen to be an extremely sensitive person.
Okay, you think you know feelings.
How do I feel?
Sad.
What about now?
Constipated.
Creepy.
Horny.
(exaggerated laughter):
(exaggerated yelling):
(exaggerated scream):
You know nothing.
This is why you don' t have a boyfriend.
No wonder you didn' t get anything from Banning.
Oh... right, I didn' t get anything from Banning except where his friggin 'lab is.
Where?
Let' s see if the great master "agent" can figure it out.
Banning said he sometimes has trouble sleeping.
Big secret.
All men have trouble sleeping.
Sometimes at night, he goes down and works in his lab.
He sleeps in his lab?
He sleeps in his bedroom.
His lab' s in his bedroom?
No.
Get your facts straight.
His lab is at his house -- his casa, where he lives -- get it?
Excellent.
You passed the test.
I put in a good word with the boss.
Well, let' s go see Chalmers tonight.
No.
Keep him out of this.
Just you and me.
You know, if you' re so good at this why- why don' t you tell me something about me?
Okay.
You have big crush on me and I know your name is Del Blaine.
First of all, you wish, and... my real name is Delilah.
Delilah?
Suits you.
Oh, God, Clark, isn' t anything sacred?
Oh, rug burns are so sexy!
It' s the driver.
(techno- pop dance music plays)
Invitations?
Oh, yes.
Why don' t you offer him five bucks?
I have them somewhere.
Nice party, huh?
So, you' re the strong, silent type, huh?
That' s the whole bouncer package.
I didn' t mean your package.
Thank you...
Dr. Schwartz.
Come, darling.
Product launch, my ass.
Let' s go find Banning' s lab.
Let' s go.
Are you trying to get me alone?
Where' d they go?
Don' t tell me the great Clark Devlin can' t come up with an answer.
Although he can walk on water.
It' s a trick, right?
Come on.
Mr. Devlin likes insects, too.
What?
Oh, uh, uh, I mean sometime I speak of myself in the third person.
Hmm, Del Blaine thinks you' re a freak.
Have you cleaned the tanks?
What are they doing down there?
I don' t know.
When you' re done here you can go and sweep the tunnels.
Don' t use the blower!
I can tell the difference.
And don' t touch the tequila for me and Mr. Banning.
Yes, Dr. Simms.
Louder!
BOTH:
We better hope the little ones follow the queen.
Well, if they don' t the stock is going to be worthless.
"Follow the queen"?
Have you seen Cheryl?
Maybe he' s gay.
Cheryl?
Let' s go have a smoke.
How did you...?
Whatever.
Look at this.
He' s pinpointed the national reservoirs.
He' s going to poison the water?
Not with that stuff.
It' s too detectable and there' s government safeguards.
Let' s check out the computer.
Now you' re thinking.
Who are they?
They shouldn' t be in the lab.
Let' s go.
Oh, my God.
Oh, your God what?
DNA recombinant microbes carrying a T- 4 genome.
English.
Genetically induced hydrogen- oxygen barrier.
Normal person' s English.
Dehydrating water.
Drink it, you' il shrivel up and die but the big question is, how is he possibly going to introduce it into the water supply?
Huh?
Go.
Quick, over there by the wall.
Nobody here.
Let' s check the hatchery.
You' re on my foot.
What was that about?
Go!
What, are they blind?
Don' t look up my skirt.
Banning' s got the bacteria but he has to transport it from his lab to the water.
There' s no way he can.
Maybe with airplanes.
Not possible.
Besides, even if he could get it to a reservoir undetected an alarm would trigger the second the surface of the water' s broken.
You' re really smart.
I' m an inexperienced girl who' s trying to bluff her way through.
You are?
Come on, stop humoring me.
Just be honest.... assuming that there are some out there...
All right.
You think I' m the great Clark Devlin.
Yeah, hello?
Steena, I can' t talk right now.... I can' t lie
Yeah.
Bad news?
Can we go somewhere and be... alone?
Sure.
I didn' t know you were so strong.
Take off your clothes.
Let' s not do anything we' il regret.
Take off your clothes.
What' s happening?
Look, I knew the second I met you you weren' t Clark Devlin.
Now take off the tuxedo.
I wanted to tell you, but I just didn' t know how.
Take off your clothes.
What is that?
Hey!
Whoa!
You, out here!
Take the clothes.
Okay.
Slow down.
I' m Mr. Devlin' s driver.
He asked me to find Walter Strider.
I don' t want to hear any more of your lies.
Now, give me the watch and the shoes.
Now, where' s Clark Devlin and how did you think you were going to get away with this?
Things happened.
I decided to go with the flow.
What about the underwear?
They' re mine.
Jimmy.
Suits you.
These are my roommate' s, too.
Go finish your business.
Have you seen the Emperor?
No.
Impolite to leave without saying good- bye to the host.
I was just looking for Deitrich.
Like a big terrier with a little rat.
I think she was down in the lab.
Well, at least your interest in water was genuine.
Look, I' m here because of you.
You wanted to know if I could be trusted?
I bet this tux is just your size.
Thank you.
We got a positive location on Blaine, sir.
How long till we get to her?
20 minutes.
I' ve transmitted the coordinates.
Dear Mr. Devlin
I did the best I could, but it wasn' t good enough.
I did not find Walter strider for you.
I also lost your tuxedo.
I' m sure you will get it back.
I guess I will go back to being what I was before I met you.
Water Strider.
Water strider.
Water strider!
My beautiful little darlings.
Species native to Southeast Asia.
(quietly):
Yes, the water strider.
Very good.
Very good.
They touch down on the reservoirs.
Their little feet transfer a deadly bacteria without breaking the surface of the water so no alarms sound, and it looks like a nasty little trick of nature.
Fortunately there is one drinkable water source.
Yours.
Deitrich, you' re a genius.
Too bad it won' t work.
Oh... you so wrong.
Wrong!
It will work because my plan is perfect.
Sorry, Mr. Banning, it' s your plan... and mine.
Um... it' s ours.
Shut up.
Explain.
Oh, all righty.
The life cycle of the Gerris maginatus begins with mating -- something Dr. Simms is not personally familiar with.
Anyhoo, the insects swarm to freshwater where fertilized eggs are then deposited on the underside of lotus leaves and hatch into larvae.
Spare me the Discovery Channel blather.
Tell me why it won' t work.
Yes, tell us.
Why it won' t work?
This is the northern hemisphere, correct?
You incubated insects native to the southern hemisphere.
So, simply, it is too cold for them to mature sexually -- much like Simms here.
Therefore... they won' t mate.
Therefore, they won' t seek out water.
Is this true?
No, I knew a girl once, in college, quite well.
Very well.
And then you remember cousin Doris?
No, Simms, the bugs.
The bugs.
Oh, you' re not going to believe this hootchie are you, Mr. Banning?
Oh, yeah?
Ask him if I lied about the tuxedo.
This tuxedo is... it' s all right.
"All right"?
That is the most incredible piece of technology on the planet.
And I am laying it in your big, hot hands.
Mr. Banning, release the bugs.
Go ahead.
You might have a chance at second prize at a junior high school science fair but you can forget your dreams of world domination.
Slip into it, Deitrich.
See how it feels.
DEVLlN:
You' ve got plenty of it.
Hey, Dr. Schwartz.
Tell your boss Clark Devlin is back.
Drapes nicely.
(beeping)
Well, it certainly puts a spring in one' s step.
Happy to have lightened your loafers, Deitrich.
One question.
Why are you doing this?
Hey, what the hell is this?
All they serve is highly chlorinated tap water.
Presenting Clark Devlin.
Have I told you how amazing you look in this tuxedo?
Simms, prepare for release.
With pleasure, sir.
Hatchery doors opening.
Water sources targeted.
Pods will begin releasing striders in five minutes.
Maturation level:
Why are you here?
I' ve come to save you.
That' s great.
What about the big guys with the big guns?
For years, I' ve heard about you.
Now we finally meet, I find that the great Clark Devlin is nothing more than an ordinary man who' s about to die an extraordinary death.
You' re right except for one thing.
My name' s Tong.
James Tong.
You okay?
Uh, Jimmy, is there something you want to tell me?
Later.
(theme plays)
All right!
1 00% mature.
Bacteria drop sites identified.
Pods now opening.
What are you doing?!
She' s ruining everything.
Electrical malfunction.
Hatchery door is disengaged.
Ah, I knew girls like you in high school.
Yeah?
Did they do this?
Uh- huh, they did.
Mr. Banning, you must open the hatch manually.
Sod off.
Manual hatch release required.
Manual hatch release required.
Rotate valve counterclockwise to open hatch.
Get off.
Bloody open!
Manual procedure complete.
Hatchery doors opening.
Airborne striders awaiting queen release.
Hatchery doors opening.
Clark!
I mean, Jimmy, help me!
All mature striders ready for release.
Bacteria- laced microbes fully activated.
His head' s about to explode.
Look at him.
Look at him!
You might know a few tricks but you' re just a sad, pathetic man.
Smoking is bad for your health.
You okay?
By the way, nice going.
Now millions of people are going to die of dehydration.
(bugs buzzing)
They' re not flying away.
Yeah, what are they waiting for?
They are waiting... to follow the queen.
Airborne striders awaiting queen release.
DEL:
For once, you' re right.
The queen is going to lead the striders to freshwater sites all over North America.
Quick, grab it before it' s released.
Alert!
Queen strider disengaged.
Let' s go.
You dropped it.
Don' t move!
DEL:
Sir, excuse me, I deserve to see this.
Trouble.
Okay, okay, make hustle, ladies.
Let' s go.
Watch out, Aqua- Lung.
Hey, pal, nice suit.
It' s okay, kitten.
Everything' s going to be all right.
It is not okay.
You just decked the hero.
I- I' m a genius and I can testify for a piece of immunity.
Also, I' m from a neutral country...
Shut it.
Well, looks like we got here just in time.
Take credit?
Oh, you' re hilarious, Blaine.
I spearheaded the operation that took down Deitrich Banning.
I bet you' re Jimmy Tong.
Here' s your tuxedo.
You happy now?
Well, I will be when I get it safely back to headquarters.
By the way, Blaine, not a bad job for your first time in the field.
Well, I didn' t do it alone.
She always says nice things about me.
When you finally do something right, you deserve the credit.
Well, sir it' s an honor to help the United States of America.
I feel exactly the same way, soldier.
You don' t think you' re going to be able to get away with a bureaucratic pat on the butt, do you?
Well, I' m hoping to.
Ooh, man down, people.
Well... there is one thing you can do for me.
And that would be?
STEENA:
Anybody screws up and your ass is mine.
Block off this end of the street.
AGENT:
All right, we' re at T minus 30 and counting.
Is everyone in position?
Manhole agent up.
Flower lady, hot dog vendor, go.
Replace the hot dog vendor.
Come on, hustle.
Let' s go.
This is Bird Three, the street is secure.
Uh- oh, bike messenger.
Hostile forces moving in.
Roger.
Advance the lead operation vehicle.
Bring in the package as soon as I cross.
AGENT:
Roger that.
Hustle, people.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, it' s show time.
How' s our package?
I forget what to say.
But you can do this.
Focus.
Go.
Package dropped.
Target locked.
Jimmy, what do you say?
The name' s Tong.
STEENA:
DEL:
No.
Well, sort of.
Oh, God.
DEVLlN:
He' s just pumping out pheromones.
Clark, shut up.
I do believe I' m in charge of this operation.
Why did you wear those pants?
AGENT:
He' s stopping.
- What' s he stopping for?
Use the door, Jimmy.
AGENT 2:
Have you seen her?
- It' s the gallery owner.
Randall, quiet.
Clark, please, would you focus?
He' s about to speak.
Open your mouth.
Hi.
That' s the girl?
He came up with that on his own.
Jimmy, smile, come on.
Move on to something else -- quick.
He doesn' t look so good.
He doesn' t look so good.
Clark, give him a line.
Steena, shut up.
- Clark, no.
Looks like he' s hyperventilating.
If I remember rightly, it worked...
Listen to me.
I can' t think with you screaming in my ear.
Everybody calm down, all right?
Not you, her.
No, no, her, her.
It' s me.... and tell her you had a dream about her last night.
Clark, be quiet.
Del, will you shut up?
I hate to say this, Jimmy but don' t take advice from women about women.
Shut up.
The voices are screaming in my ear.
Hey, if you can hear me wipe that look off your face.
Hooters.
(agents groan)
Soul patch.
Okay, I' m going to have to ask you to leave.
DEVLlN:
You' re the love of my life.
No, you never tell them you love them, Jimmy.
Can you have... dinner with me?
Get out.
Pretty sure he craps his pants, people.
I just want to have dinner.
Get out now.
- Lunch?
- Now!
All right, we' re terminating this mission.
Pack it up and roll home.
I think I blew it, Mr. Devlin.
Jimmy, I wrote the book on this stuff.
Trust me, you didn' t blow it.
You outgrew her.
Maybe.
Take the weekend off.
First thing Monday morning we' il head for somewhere with more interesting prospects.
How about Monte Carlo?
Sounds good.
Thanks, Mr. Devlin.
Thanks, everybody.
It' s okay, Jimmy.
AGENT 3:
Well, if you were trying to get her to notice you mission accomplished.
What are you planning for the second date?
Running at her with a knife?
It' s difficult for me.
What is so hard?
You just have to say something like...
"Excuse me, you want to go get some coffee?"
When I around beautiful women, I can' t talk.
Beautiful women.
You know, a real knockout.
Like the beautiful lady in the gallery.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
What' s wrong?
Nothing.
What?
You can' t tell how I feel?
You look sad.
No.
Sick?
No.
Constipated?
No.
A little.
Tell me, what' s wrong?
It' s just no guy would ever do anything for me
Like what you did for her.
You know why?
Because you are a pain in the butt.
Yeah, nice working with you, too.
Hello.
Delilah, excuse me.
You want to have a coffee?
I only drink organic green tea.
Wrong answer.
You' re never going to have a boyfriend.
Fine.
Coffee.
I love coffee.
You learn quick.
Is that your happy face or your horny face?
I tell you later.
James.
James...
Couldn' t tell you what I' m about to say.
I' m sorry.
(laughing)
The bird hit the guy.
WOMAN:
Is this a bunch crap?
Bunch of crap.
You think I' m speak very good English, huh?
What' s in your head, flies out your mouth.
What' s in your head, fly from your mouth.
What' s in your mouth...
Cut.
No wonder.
This is why you don' t have a boyfriend.
Frog?
Look at her ugly face.
Every time, she just like this.
How can I act?
- Can we do a single on me?
Cut!
Who?
(giggling)
I got the happy partner over here.
What do you...?
She smile the whole movie.
Waste of film, waste of time.
What is she doing?
You' re fast.
But I' m faster.
Good God!
{y: i} Here was Troy 3000 years ago, {y: i} a city of destiny... {y: i}... so situated that it dominated {y: i} the Hellespont... {y: i}... today known as the Dardanelles.
{y: i} This was the only sea route {y: i} to and from the east.
{y: i} As a result, Troy grew prosperous... {y: i}... a tempting prize of war {y: i} for the Greek nations.
{y: i} The Trojans had long memories of the {y: i} time when the Greeks, led by Sparta... {y: i}... had pillaged and burned {y: i} the city of their fathers.
{y: i} They had prepared strong defenses {y: i} against the possibility of future assault.
{y: i} That is why new Troy, {y: i} their rebuilt city... {y: i}... was guarded by mighty walls, {y: i} an impregnable shelter... {y: i}... for a happy people in love with beauty.
{y: i} In the palace square {y: i} and the busy streets... {y: i}... the industrious citizens were enjoying {y: i} the works of peace... {y: i}... as though this carefree era {y: i} would last forever.
{y: i} There was Lord Aeneas, {y: i} nephew of King Priam... {y: i}... on his way to the palace... {y: i}... where the future of Troy {y: i} was being weighed by the royal council.
And so we' ve locked out the understanding of nations...... and we' ve locked in the poison.
Trojans jumping at every rumor...... pointing fingers at each other.
I tell you there' s only one solution.
Go to Sparta.
Go wherever you will...... but don' t try to drag the destiny of Troy with you.
What destiny, to live like a crab in a shell?
We live well.
That' s our blood.
Stupidity!
We' il choke on our own fat unless we sail our ships of trade.
But how can we, when every harbor is an enemy' s?
- Oh, I' m sick of your crazy dreams.
- Careful, brother.
Paris has always been able to crack your neck.
And you can thrash us both.
- Tell him he' s a fool, Hector!
- My sons...... the fool is the man who makes a quarrel of a debate.
Paris, I bless your plan to sail to Sparta.
I know I can trust you not to beg for peace.
I' il try to convince the Greeks our power makes a treaty advisable.
I' d convince them.
I' d take 100 ships of war and burn the soil of Sparta black!
I' m sure you would, Polydorus, and create endless war.
And you, Hector, do you aspire to anything...
-... but to excel at swordplay and boxing?
- Yes, sire.
The javelin and the discus.
Hector' s a good son, Priam.
And a good husband, my lord.
Is that not sufficient glory?
By your leave, Paris' ship is ready to sail.
Do the gods approve the day and the hour?
The omens are good and also the prophecies, with but one exception.
One troubled priestess of the temple.
- My daughter.
- Don' t be angry, Priam.
- Cassandra is ill.
- Sick in the mind.
Arise, Paris...... and go.
The virgin Cassandra does make one point that causes me much concern.
Prince Paris, it appears, gives all his worship to one goddess alone.
- Aphrodite.
- I' m not sure I worship anything.
No.
Admiration is the better word.
Admiration for the beauty of a marble image.
It was not the goddess of beauty who taught us to arm against our enemies...... but Athena, the goddess of wisdom...... and the patroness of the horses of war.
This solitary adoration of yours.
Neither is she delighted that you undertake a mission of peace.
And I suppose that evil horse of hers will spring out and trample me.
Very well.
Let it come, my lord...... if that' s the price of living in a world of fables.
Do not say that, Paris.
Do not seek peace elsewhere, dear brother...... until first you have pacified Athena.
My little Cassandra, there can be no postponement.
Give me your blessing for a happy voyage.
I cannot bless what I see in your future.
Cassandra!
- Cassandra, stop this.
- But, Father, it' s true.
What I see and feel is true.
Go, Paris.
Come, Cassandra.
- Come and rest a while.
- How can I, Mother?
Oh, I wish it hadn' t been given me...... this agony I live with.
Paris!
Paris, don' t go.
Please don' t go.
- I must sail at once.
- If you have any love for Troy...... don' t bring this dreadful thing upon us.
- And I thought you loved me best of all.
- I do, but...... the noise, the storm grows so great.
The screaming of horses, the cries of dying men.
- Take care of her.
- My dear, my dear.
Perhaps it could not be otherwise.
What must be, no one can change.
Where are we today?
Elysium?
Far from it.
We' re nearing Sparta...... a harsh military land, where a man will cut off his arm to prove he' s brave.
- I wonder what the women look like.
- My profound Cousin Aeneas.
To think deeply, Paris, one must think of women.
They bring all life into the world and much death.
- They sway the destinies of men.
- Not my destiny.
What' s the matter?
Oh, just a quickening of the breeze.
But I don' t like the hot breath of it.
Oh, it' s nothing.
Only one drifting cloud up there.
Up the mast with you!
- I command you!
Climb the mast!
- Drop the sail!
My prince, the ropes are fouled, and these men refuse to climb the mast.
- I' il flay them!
- No!
There' s only one way to cure these fantasies.
No, my prince, not you.
No!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Megas!
Aphrodite.
What?
Some ship had bad luck.
She does exist.
- Who?
- The fairest goddess.
This creature is crazy.
But with a nice sort of craziness.
What was your ship?
{y: i} The Dolphin...
-... of Troy.
- A Trojan.
Cut him loose, Andros.
Maybe we can warm some life into him before we turn him over to the soldiers.
Women!
Why warm a man to cut his throat?
Cover him up, quickly.
We' re looking for our sovereign lady, the Queen of Sparta.
She came to the shore to visit a nurse of her childhood days.
- My lady.
- I left orders not to be disturbed here.
But there are certain developments which make this beach unsafe today.
A strange ship was sighted running out of the storm.
Heavy seas.
It' s possible she left spies.
You see Trojan phantoms everywhere.
- This was no phantom ship.
- The emblem of the royal House of Troy.
The king would want me to insist that his queen return at once.
lnform King Menelaus that Cora is taking excellent care of me.
Go along now.
Very well, my lady.
Andraste!
- Andraste, help us carry this man.
- A man, my lady?
How interesting!
- I can' t risk hiding a Trojan.
- Yes.
What if he' s a warrior and only pretending?
You must be careful.
Women who are always careful miss much in life, Andraste.
He doesn' t seem to recover.
But his heart beats.
Give him some broth, and we' il turn him over.
- Good.
- Oh, no!
They' il kill him.
- I still say good.
- And I, too, would say so...
-... if he were as unattractive as you.
- Thank you.
To whom am I indebted for this gallant defense?
Nobody of importance.
I am only a slave.
Now tell us about yourself, Trojan.
Did I mention that?
My memory is clouded.
But I do recall I thought you a vision.
A goddess.
Dear Aphrodite...... allow me to present myself.
- Prince Paris of Troy.
- We' il dispense with impudence.
You' re a bit impudent yourself for whatever you are, a slave?
- Silence!
You' re addressing -- - A slave of the palace, Andros.
Of what importance is that?
I tell you truly, I am Prince Paris.
I come to offer a treaty of peace to King Menelaus.
But of course, you don' t believe me.
My articles of identity...... all the gifts I was bringing to the Court of Sparta....
My crew won' t come near a Spartan harbor now.
They' il swear the gods hurled lightning at me.
Perhaps I do believe you.
The sea has damaged your appearance, but not your manner.
You must leave here at nightfall.
Follow the coast.
You' il reach a cove where Phoenician ships put in.
- No.
I still have a mission.
- Do as I tell you!
Our soldiers have a habit of plunging a dagger into strangers.
And why should that worry you?
The feelings of a slave are of no importance.
They are to me.
In any place but Sparta, one so fair would be a queen.
In Troy, we' d make songs about you.
King Menelaus would not permit that here.
Because you' d make his queen look plain.
She would be pained to hear you say that.
Do you know her?
I' m her shadow.
And I always thought I knew her.
No, I don' t believe anyone knows Queen Helen very well...
-... including Helen.
- Not even the king?
Great power doesn' t need knowledge.
Wait.
I only ask these questions...
-... because I must go to the palace.
- Don' t chance it.
I intend to be discreet, so prepare me.
If Menelaus won' t help me, I' il ask the queen.
That you must never do!
I --
Oh, if you were old and ugly, maybe then she could help you.
But you' re not old, nor ugly.
It' s late, Andros.
We must get the fish to market.
Gladly.
If the soldiers find him here, I don' t want to be involved.
I wouldn' t mind.
We must get back to the palace, Andraste.
I' ve stayed here too long.
Promise me...... we' il meet again.
You can go back now.
Supplies, for your voyage home.
So you still hope I won' t go to the palace?
More than ever.
The kings of Greece are gathering there to consider a war against Troy.
Then my mission was well- timed.
- When will they be in council?
- Tomorrow, perhaps.
But tonight...... there are only you and l.
Under the magic of the moonlight.
Here.
See what I brought you?
My dear little slave girl...... I don' t want what you steal from the palace.
I only want what I steal from the palace.
No, my prince.
Very well, then, I' il borrow you.
But we' il be quite honest about it.
- I' il offer to buy you from the queen.
- Oh, no!
That would mean death!
Nonsense.
I' il explain to her that you' re no slave to me...... but my future Princess of Troy.
Let me go, Paris.
Don' t you believe I could love a slave?
Yes, I believe.
My heart believes and loves you.
My heart is yours, Paris, but I can never be.
You must not seek out the queen, nor anyone at the palace.
And this moment must be our last.
Don' t ask me why.
Call it magic, call it a dream.
And never speak of it to anyone.
Hear our Spartan host, King Menelaus.
- Are you sure Ulysses is coming?
- His ship was not far behind mine.
This great Ithacan refused to leave his wife and farm.
He' s so sick of war, he wouldn' t let go of the plow.
Till his child was cast in front of it, to convince him Greece' s glory...... comes before contentment.
You can have the glory.
I' il take Troy' s gold.
Not my share, brother.
Ulysses, King of lthaca!
Greetings, friend.
You' re acquainted with everyone.
Ajax, Prince of Salamis.
Nestor, King of Pylos.
Diomedes, ruler of Aetolia.
And I think you know my brother, King Agamemnon of Mycenae.
Greetings, fellow pirates.
It is a righteous war we plan, Ulysses...... a war of defensive aggression.
A neat sort of righteousness.
You think the Trojans built a citadel for peace- lovers?
Have you heard of Priam' s sons?
Polydorus begs for war!
Hector wants only a challenge.
Paris is anyone' s equal with a cestus, bow and javelin.
You believe they want peace?
All the more reason why we cannot plan without Achilles.
But he hates my brother and me --
He hates you almost as much as he loves war.
In order to lock himself from all temptation of joining with us...... he hid himself securely, in a house of women.
That' s where I found him, hiding from all persuasion...... dressed as a woman!
Did you persuade him?
Yes.
He' s here at the stables, seeing to the care of his horses.
Achilles, a blushing girl.
I shall commend him for the beauty of his face and figure.
The man who blows his own horn.
Commend him, Menelaus.
I commend you, Achilles.
And I despise you.
And you, Agamemnon.
But it seems we must unite...... so I am here to lead you.
- Lead us, Achilles?
- Of course.
I and my good friend Patroclus.
Since we were boys, we could stand alone and defy an army.
- I question that.
- Who?
I, Ajax.
My imitator.
You disgusting glory- hunter.
To imitate him, I' d need to wear three layers of armor.
That' s where he gets his reputation for being invulnerable.
Silence this fool, Menelaus.
I would prefer not to be angered by him.
The truth of the matter is, his skin' s as tender as his vanity.
And especially his heel.
- He can' t even stand leather against it.
- I do not fight with my feet.
Take your ease, my prince.
I' il handle this buffoon.
Enough of this.
We must remain united.
lmpossible.
We' ve never been united, and we never will be.
Keep my horses ready.
Patroclus, we shall leave.
I see no ethical purpose for a raid on Troy.
- Nor I.
Wait.
Here.
You talk of ethics.
Here' s the sign of a Trojan ship prowling our shores.
No peaceful trader, but a royal ship of the House of Priam.
It was my ship, sire.
I am Paris of Troy.
- You are King Menelaus?
- Yes.
Sorry to present myself like this, I was swept overboard in the storm.
Fortunately, this gathering of the most royal of Greece...... makes my mission easier.
- How' d you know we were here?
- I beg my lord' s indulgence, I know.
So I' m saved from journeying to each king...... if you decide against offers of peace I bring from Troy.
- Troy does not plan war?
You are wrong, Menelaus.
Stop this or lose your Trojan plunder.
- Where' d you find this impostor?
- He came to the palace.
- I thought you' d question him.
- You interrupt council!
- Hear him.
- This is our business.
He' s only some wandering vagabond.
See the rags he wears.
These roving jesters come often to my palace.
And they never fail to have some nimble talent.
What do you do besides this royal imposture?
It seems I try to do the impossible.
The cesti.
If he' s Paris, he should have some skill with the cesti.
- Brilliant, brother, brilliant.
- You heard, Ajax, Achilles?
Achilles is weary from travel.
Achilles did not make his reputation fighting children.
This Sparta, my son, is a viper' s nest.
- I' il see you aren' t -- - If we offend the pretender...
-... I give him leave to go.
- No.
After all, part of my task was to spread civilization.
But I must exact an agreement.
If I come fairly out of this fight, will you believe that I am Paris...... and hear the Trojan peace terms?
If your head' s still on your shoulders, yes.
Paris!
My good Trojan, you have used a Spartan persuasion on me: courage.
My courage almost failed me at the thought of meeting Ajax.
You shall rest.
And tomorrow we shall talk.
About your adventures, your voyage...... and the secret charm that makes me call you "friend."
And Troy shall call Sparta "friend."
Alpheus, find quarters for our guest.
And, Alpheus...... they say the Trojans have great eyes for beauty.
Find him a slave and see that she is beautiful.
There is one slave in your palace for whom I' d gladly become a slave myself.
Menelaus!
You expressed a wish yesterday to present your guests to me.
A proud wish.
Helen, Queen of Sparta, wife to Menelaus...... I present Paris, Prince Royal of Troy.
Why are you here, Trojan?
To study our arts and culture?
Yes, my lady.
The art of self- preservation.
Trojan impudence!
By your leave, my lord...... I shall receive the Greeks at some happier moment.
I heard my lady was truly Spartan this afternoon.
My heart behaved like a fool.
I' m sure Menelaus could hear it beating.
Tell your servants to go.
You may go.
- Get out!
- When will you learn?
The man can neither speak nor hear.
What did you think of the Trojan?
- You saw what I thought.
- Yes, I saw what you thought.
Of this Trojan anyway.
What is this game you' re playing?
Helen, you reveal yourself.
So does he.
Speak plainly.
If I' ve given you some offense, punish me...... but don' t welcome a stranger with one hand and strike him with the other!
So now we' re fond of Trojans?
I might do many things with him.
I might send him home...... with his appearance altered.
I might hold him hostage to bleed tribute out of Priam.
I imagined once I had married a king.
- You married a king.
- I married a robber.
Why did you marry him?
When a king takes spoils, he robs no one.
He fulfills justice.
The way of a Spartan.
I understand these things.
You do not.
I understand enough.
Then understand your place in the palace, nowhere else!
You' ve seen this man before.
Admit it.
Your silence condemns you.
You' ve been out of the palace secretly.
You know this man.
Silent as ever.
I am your husband!
- Don' t.
- Say "husband" to me.
Say "husband" to me.
I can think of many ways of dealing with your Trojan, Helen.
Andraste.
I am the slave sent to the Prince of Troy.
The queen' s handmaiden, eh?
The king commands me to entertain his guests.
A fine Greek custom, but guest?
He' s in a prison, if he only knew it.
Oh, I' m instructed that he shall not know it.
Must King Menelaus command you himself to admit me?
The royal temper' s already running a fever.
Shall I tell the king you said that?
Get to your business, you little troublemaker.
You should be in bed.
Yes, I should but --
But your mistress sent you to play another trick on me.
No.
She sent me to help you escape.
Escape?
Those two soldiers on watch down there...... are they going to help me too?
You' re a captive.
The king plans tortures for you.
You must leave quickly.
Return to the fisherman' s hut.
I' il go a distance with you to point the way.
My good friend Menelaus.
- The door is also watched.
- Then what chance have I?
Helen thought to make you look like a merchant.
Any fool could see you' re a prince.
- Soldiers.
- Fisherman!
- Yes?
- Fisherman!
Yes?
- What do you want?
- A cup of wine.
- Oh.
Cora, the wineskin.
The captain' s an idiot.
Does he think the man will swim?
He' d be deep in the forest by now.
Here.
Take it with you.
Go, and remember, there will be soldiers above...... so you' d best try the rocks under the cliff.
Get to a cove beyond the tower.
There, a boat will send you to the ship.
Wings of Mercury speed you.
Why do you wait?
It was just a foolish hope.
- I half- imagined she' d come.
- Here?
She sent you garments...... arranged for a Phoenician ship to take you home.
What more, Trojan?
I didn' t really expect her to come.
- I only hoped.
- Don' t even breathe it.
If she should show her face here and be recognized....
I know.
And I wish I could repay you for your kindness.
And for the queen...... tell her she' il walk in all my dreams.
Wait!
The ship is not yet in the cove.
Helen.
Andraste, you are free.
- Go as far away as you can from Sparta.
- My lady.
You made clear to Adelphus what I said?
- He is far off by this time.
- Then be on your way.
Freedom is made of quicksilver sometimes.
Go.
Hurry.
Helen.
Helen is the queen.
The girl you thought you knew was quite nameless and without reality.
I can' t believe that.
- It was she who helped me to escape.
- No.
That was the queen who hates cruelty.
She would have done the same for any slave.
I see.
She is the queen who comes here to say this.
She will always remember the gentle Paris.
And she will do her small part to turn this nation from war.
- You' re not a Spartan.
- I am.
Daughter of a king who chose a Spartan husband for me.
A man you despised.
I despise oppression, as do many others here.
We need to be Spartan to endure it.
And we need to be understood.
You are.
You, not Menelaus, will be Sparta to me.
I' il tell my father there' s still hope.
I' il tell Troy what I' ve seen and heard.
The rulers divided, unable to find cause for war...... even the Spartan people.
Stop worrying.
The kings have been carousing all night.
And so she is real, that one I loved.
Yes.
The gods sometimes change the bravest of intentions.
They are kind.
I' il never doubt them again.
Oh, Helen.
Helen, you are a slave as long as Menelaus possesses you.
Come to Troy with me.
And destroy the hope of peace you were taking home with you?
No.
If even one Trojan dies on the walls, I' m a failure.
Forgive me, Helen.
You are two women, both wise and good.
I am two men.
One fairly good, I try to believe.
The other, very bad indeed.
One is a man.
The other just a boy, I think.
Paris, let him be so always.
Never let him grow old.
Helen.
The ship.
And now I must go back.
It is a way the gods have...... to give with one hand and take with two.
Oh, no.
This is not goodbye.
You shall still be with me across the sea.
And you with me.
And always young, Paris, remember?
What is remembered is forever young.
Halt!
Stand still, Trojan.
- My lady, I ask you remove yourself -- - Send your archers away.
I beg the queen to stand out of danger.
You' il die.
I can no more than lose my own life, and it' s lost if I let him go.
Silence!
Helen!
Helen!
Helen!
She' s in there.
- No.
- She' s in there.
Break the locks!
- Break them.
Break.
It' s true.
The Trojan' s taken Helen.
He' s carried her away.
By force, against her will.
To think of her struggles, her fruitless cries for help.
We had our differences, but she was my wife.
It goes deeper than that.
This is the assault of all women in Greece.
Shame on every Greek nation.
Follow them.
Ulysses, why do you sit?
She must be restored to me.
Later.
- Yes.
Now, now, now!
Will you not stand with me?
Menelaus, we will reclaim her, and with her, all the loot of Troy.
But only if you wait.
We' il send out a call to every city in Greece.
All Greeks united in a war of honor.
Yes.
That' s what the future will call it.
I call it that now.
This Prince of Troy has asked for war, not peace.
Ulysses.
I' m sure you' il agree with me that it is my duty to become our leader.
Leader?
I' il see no one but Achilles as leader.
It is my consecrated duty to become our leader to avenge my dear brother.
Quite, quite, Agamemnon.
And I will follow you.
And tell you what to do, as usual.
And I will persuade the sensitive Achilles...... with certain fascinating facts...... about the great store of gold to be found in Troy.
I seek no treasure.
I will kill.
So shall we all, brother.
To defend your honor.
Who are they?
I don' t know, but I know the color of their gold.
Sparta is the past, Helen.
Troy is this way.
What will they call us there?
A woman who left her husband.
A prince turned thief.
What else can we ever be?
Two people in love.
Against the world, if need be.
If I could make a bargain with the gods...... we would escape the world...... never landing on any shore.
A lovely dream, but somewhere we must land.
Paris, there' s an island called Pelagos.
The sea can feed us.
And there are little houses near the village well.
Let' s go there.
I cannot.
I was born to an obligation.
Paris, son of Priam, heir to responsibility.
I could leave the kingdoms of the world and never miss them.
- But you -- - Helen...... our life together will fade if I run from this.
It will become a slight thing that any storm can tear apart.
No, Paris.
Forgive me.
I forget you are a woman, not a goddess.
Captain.
- You know the island of Pelagos?
- It' s far southward...
-... through the Cytherean straits.
- Sail southward.
- Captain.
- Yes?
We have decided otherwise.
Sail north to Troy.
- What is it?
- You' il have to see, Lord Aeneas.
Wait.
Aeneas, call the queen.
Paris!
Paris.
Come and meet my brothers.
Hector, Polydorus.
I told you about them.
Lucky Paris.
You could fall in the black pit of Hades...... and come out with arms full of sunshine.
He' s always had a fine flair for surprises.
I' m happy to see that you diverted your mission...... to an enterprise more to your talents.
Come.
- Aeneas.
- Paris.
- Paris.
- I should have had faith.
The great god Zeus would never let him die...
-... and with him our hopes of peace.
- It' s a miracle.
Tell us what happened, Paris.
Here is your miracle.
I would never have seen Troy again but for her.
It would have taken a sea sprite to save you.
How could one so tender have managed it?
Postpone your questions.
She suffered an ordeal that I shan' t relate in her presence.
It' s enough that our son has been given back to us by you, my dear.
You are welcome, my child.
See that she is made comfortable.
Later, you shall tell me of your adventures.
At your command, Father.
My brother seems to have forgotten his courtliness.
By what name, my lady, shall we know you?
- My name is -- - Her name is death.
- Cassandra!
- Forgive her.
She suffers an illness.
Wait.
You were going to say?
I am Helen, Queen of Sparta.
The wife of King Menelaus?
- His wife no more.
- The goddess of beauty, Aphrodite...... come down to Earth in mortal form.
She will bring the disaster I have prophesied.
Her name will be written in letters of fire.
Helen.
Helen of Troy.
And she saved my life again...... but at such risk to herself that I couldn' t leave her...... to the mercy of the Spartans.
I can see I' ve troubled you, sire.
But in your affection for me and mine for you...... I hope you will judge me fairly.
I would never have believed that this could happen...... not through this son of mine.
This son who shared my hope of everlasting peace.
Who promised he would bring it.
Dishonor.
You have united the Greeks.
You have kindled a flame that will weld them together against us.
This will bring them to our very shores.
That should delight you.
You may have to answer for the death of many a good Trojan.
You have presumed too much upon our affection.
Paris...... send her back to Sparta and make your peace with Menelaus.
I' il never send her back.
- You reject every word of wisdom?
- My love has no logic.
It could only choose between Troy and Pelagos.
Helen wanted to go to Pelagos...... but I had to bring you the warning.
And she had the courage to come with me.
But she was right.
We' il seek it elsewhere.
The coward' s way to avoid the fight?
- You exceed the rights of a brother.
You scorn every Trojan duty.
The damage is done.
Go or stay.
It matters not.
- I shall not see you again.
- Priam.
Bring to the council chamber the armory masters and the granary stewards.
Tell them I want an estimate of Troy' s ability to withstand a siege.
There were times when I almost forgot that I had other children, Paris...... others to die, perhaps.
Destiny, Paris.
Destiny.
Every Trojan woman with son or husband will curse you.
Well, don' t worry, brother, a war may clear the atmosphere.
War, the only thing that could make you happy.
Keep out of my way, or you' il never live to enjoy it.
- Lord Aeneas.
- You may go.
The ship that brought you to Troy is still in the harbor.
My charioteer will take you there.
I see.
Or if my lady prefers, I' il arrange for a royal escort.
No, I won' t delay.
Wait for us.
My chariot will be in the courtyard.
Athena wields much power, it seems.
- If I return to Menelaus -- - No.
Pelagos?
Yes, I' il take you to Pelagos.
You said our lives would fade if you ran away.
I also said that you' d be happy in Troy.
Paris, the word has spread.
- They are not armed with flowers.
- Quick, before they overrun the courtyard.
They won' t as long as they enjoy their carnival.
- Take Helen to the harbor.
- Don' t show yourself to them.
- See her aboard the ship.
- Paris!
Dog!
You expect us to fight a war for your amusement?
My brave Trojans...... will you show as much spirit against the Spartan army...... as against one Spartan woman?
Can you stand alone, each, in battle...... or do you need the cowardice of numbers to make you bold?
Go home and search your hearts, Trojans...... for all this must be answered soon.
- You can leave safely now.
- Without you?
I mustn' t lose it, Helen.
There' s no Pelagos if I' m there alone.
But there' s always one island where the storm can' t touch us.
It' s anyplace, Paris, where we' re together.
- Here?
- Oh, yes, even here.
{y: i} News reached Troy {y: i} that the Greeks were about to sail... {y: i}... with the mightiest armada ever known {y: i} to man.
The Trojans prepared for war.
Our signals have never warned of so many ships.
We' re ready.
- Hundreds.
- Many more than we can count.
- Five, 600.
More.
- No less than 1000 ships.
- We' il make them pay a heavy price.
What shall we pay?
Aeneas, bring them here.
Let them see.
Yes, sire.
Faster.
Faster.
- See what you have brought upon us?
- Father.
The face that launched 1000 ships.
Now remember, these Trojan walls are our strength and our substance...... so let no eager fool attempt to charge this plain...... until these ramparts have served their purpose.
Well, to your posts.
Hector, where is my place?
Beside your Spartan woman.
Come with me, brother.
I' il share Spartan blood with you.
You can have my share.
No Trojans to greet us?
I had hoped they' d be foolish enough to scatter their forces.
- Where do we make camp, Agamemnon?
- Camp?
No, onwards.
Every moment of delay, my Helen suffers.
Our camp is the Trojan palace.
We must attack at once.
Against Troy' s walls, Achilles?
No.
We must equip to take this fortress.
Ulysses is right.
We must prepare.
{y: i} The canny counsel of Ulysses prevailed.
{y: i} The Greeks consolidated their beachhead {y: i} and built machines for attack... {y: i}... on a scale big enough {y: i} to match the Trojan walls.
Follow Achilles!
Hector.
- To the ramps.
Back!
- We' re outflanked!
Fall back!
Return to your towers.
To the ramps.
Back!
Back!
Polydorus.
It' s a good war, Paris.
Hector, the man of peace...... now our greatest warrior.
Thank Helen for your destiny.
- Thank Paris.
- I thank him for my life.
Oh, great Zeus, king of all...... we give to you Polydorus, Prince of Troy.
I pray you, judge him with compassion and understanding.
Let not Athena' s hatred feed on my defenseless son...... but on our sorrow here.
We, the living dead of Troy, shall pay his debt...... in the years of siege to come.
{y: i} And the Greeks did prepare {y: i} for years of siege.
{y: i} They unloaded provisions {y: i} from their ships... {y: i}... and as time went on {y: i} they looted and raped... {y: i}... the small surrounding villages.
Take your hands off her!
- A warrior commanding his commander?
- She' s mine.
Great as you are, I' m still your chieftain, protector of all the spoils of war.
- Take her to my quarters.
- No.
Agamemnon, if you take this girl, I shall sail home.
Fly.
- Agamemnon!
Come on.
- Sail home, great warrior.
No, Achilles.
Out!
Out!
Out!
Achilles, Agamemnon does not speak for all our people.
Dogs!
Jackals!
I' il never fight his battles again.
But for Greece, you' il fight.
No more.
{y: i} During these years of stalemate, {y: i} the Trojans... {y: i}... from the safety of their walls, {y: i} constantly harassed the invaders... {y: i}... with night raids on their camps.
- Helen, how perfect.
- The girl you fell in love with?
Always keep that image with you, Paris.
I shan' t need to.
I have the source of its magic.
Right here, I hold its living warmth...... and its spirit is always with me on the ramparts.
Then it can' t be lost, can it?
What has been lived and shared is never lost.
- Never, Helen.
- But if you should lose me...... could you resign yourself to that?
Don' t worry, nothing will happen to you.
Nothing endures on Earth, Paris, neither sorrow nor happiness...... or people in love.
Dear Helen, she looks for shadows in the one bright place in Troy.
People in love should not be blind.
They should look to the future and prepare for separation.
But not so gloomily, my love.
I' il meet you in Elysium...... where an age of years is just a wink of time.
You charter a ship.
I' il take the flying horse, Pegasus.
To our island, Paris?
Oh, goddess come to Earth, make me immortal with your kiss...... and we' il live on nectar and ambrosia.
- But I' m not sure I like being so ethereal.
- Nor I.
How many years, fellow Trojans, shall we suffer?
Our only respite, a truce to burn our dead.
The holiday of a Troy that once knew happy times.
Must the Trojans always set their funeral pyre so near this house?
- How long will they accuse me?
- They lost many loved ones, my lady.
Lulled by the promises of peace forever.
I, for one, believe we might have had that peace....
I thought I could escape from it, but there is no place --
- And no victory for anybody.
Leave me.
Paris commanded me to stay with you while he' s on duty.
Leave me, I tell you.
No, friends!
Hear me, Trojans.
Cast her to the Spartans.
Cast Paris out of Troy.
- If you haven' t the fiber for this....
- Helen, don' t go out.
Their mood is dangerous.
I' ve sent soldiers to disperse them.
- You' ve come to ask me to leave Troy.
- No, Helen.
No.
But for Paris, I would have lost Hector.
I must love my sons equally...... and whomsoever they love.
You are good.
The high priest says that even the gods fight each other.
Some for Athena and Greece, some for Troy and Aphrodite.
How, then, could I blame you for this war?
- No one could.
I could...... if I return to the Greeks, to Menelaus.
Go back to someone you so despise?
If it brings an end to war and restores Paris to the love of the Trojans....
- He' d never let you go.
- And could I ever leave him?
- You must help me to decide.
- Would you defy the Fates?
No mortal should attempt so much, Helen.
And yet I wonder...... is one so lovely quite mortal?
No.
I am everything I was determined not to be.
I have only been selfish.
All the despair, the pain and the tears I' ve brought.
How different from that island dream.
Return to your King of Troy...... and tell him we will receive Helen at the appointed place.
But warn him there must be no treachery or deceit.
I assure you, my lord, no deceit exists.
It is her wish to return to King Menelaus.
- It' s her wish.
You hear that, brother?
- I' ve heard it often.
Wait, herald.
Tell your master from Menelaus that we demand --
No, no, no.
Nothing else.
Nothing else, only the return of Helen.
The Trojans wish to make peace.
As men of peace, we accept their offer.
Have we suffered to return empty- handed?
Empty- handed, Menelaus?
With Helen returned, integrity satisfied?
You are too outspoken, brother.
When the Trojans have handed over Helen, we' il teach them...... that we' re not easily bought off.
But I' d like Achilles with us, in case they prove troublesome.
He still refuses to fight so long as you' re in command...... and your lovesick jackass of a brother brays upon this beach.
Then he' il get not one obol of Trojan tribute.
Helen?
Helen.
- Where is she?
- She' s not here, Paris.
Not here?
Where?
She' s gone to the camp of the Greeks.
To Menelaus?
She was determined to end the destruction...... and restore you to the hearts of the Trojans.
- And you conspired with her -- - She was not a captive here, Paris...... but a woman of self- determination, a queen with more courage...... than I would have had to sail against the tides of heaven.
- He shan' t take her.
- The hour has passed, Paris.
You can' t prevent it.
Wait, Trojans.
You' ve returned the wife of Menelaus, but that isn' t all your debt.
Debt?
- We recognize no claim of debt.
- No?
Then who pays for the Greek blood shed on this plain?
Trojan blood has paid in full.
Trojan blood is not valid currency in Sparta...... nor does it pay for launching 1000 ships.
The terms of this truce were clear.
The return of Helen, in exchange for which...... you agreed to sail from these shores.
- You trusting fools.
- Two things only will suffice:
Half the treasury of Troy before we depart...... and after that, 1000 talents every year.
Take these nobles as security!
- Here' s payment, Menelaus!
- To the gates with her!
Bring her back to Troy!
Follow them!
After them!
After them!
Back!
Turn back!
Don' t go too close to the Trojan walls.
Not against Hector.
Patroclus!
Patroclus!
- Bring me my armor.
- Yes, master.
Thank you, Trojan, for bringing us the body of Patroclus.
Thank you very much.
My son, Greek treachery has proved that theirs is not a war of honor.
Helen, through you, we have learned that they seek plunder, not justice.
I ask forgiveness of you both.
Cassandra...... we have found there is great wisdom in you.
- What more can you tell us?
- New storms shall ride the sky...... but the guilt will be Athena' s, not Helen' s.
- Thank you, Cassandra.
- Such courage must not go unrewarded.
Helen, you will be a princess of Troy.
Where is Hector and Andromache?
They are to bestow the laurels.
Where is Hector?
By the Scaean gates, sire.
He anticipates a call to single combat for the death of Patroclus.
I killed him.
Any Greek challenge would come to me.
But Hector didn' t want you to be challenged by Achilles.
- He was devoted to Patroclus.
- Hector sent him his friend' s corpse...... with personal compliments.
No one can match Achilles, not even Hector.
This must not happen.
He cried like an animal in grief, my lord, and then called for his armor.
Ah, so he comes.
Hector!
Hector!
- It is done, Andromache.
- Achilles?
By his hand, my father and my brothers fell.
- While you live, I still have them in you.
- I intend to live, Andromache, for you...... and for our son.
This helmet always frightens him.
Let' s pray that he may never need one...... that he finds peace.
Arms to bear.
If Achilles wins, we move.
We strike at once!
To the palace!
And if Achilles dies, we retire to consider a certain plan of mine.
- There' s an immortal shield around him.
- Mighty Zeus, help me find a weakness.
Achilles is dead!
So dies Greek courage, but not Greek cunning.
Defeated by men, deserted by the gods.
I used to number the months by a battle, a pestilence, a famine.
Now it' s all one long nightmare.
I fought wars since most of you were sucklings, but never one like this.
Let' s take our ships and sail back home.
That we shall do.
I have a plan that first required a Trojan victory.
- That much, at least, is accomplished.
- You speak treason.
As you will, but let' s be realistic.
The greatest army on Earth has lost its war.
What are you dreaming, Ulysses?
I' m dreaming of my wife, the good, constant Penelope.
And in my dreams, I see myself returning to her with all the treasures of Troy.
- But how?
- Has this anything to do with the work...... that Apagos and his men have been doing in the woodlands?
They' re building a monument to the triumph of Paris and Helen.
A gift from the goddess Athena.
A sacred horse, so big and so beautiful...... that Troy cannot help taking it to her heart.
Remember, blow the retreat loud enough for Troy to hear.
Let the ships sail but keep sufficient force in the woodlands.
The ships will return at dawn.
Are you sure the Trojans will take this monstrosity into the city?
I promise.
Their gratitude to Athena for her victory will be tremendous.
And they' il give a loving welcome to her wondrous horse.
And to Bacchus, the god of grapes.
Make ready, men of Greece!
First they sounded retreat, and now the call to man the oars.
Their torches are moving back to the sea.
- Aboard the ships?
- We' il soon know.
Lord Aeneas has gone to the shore with scouts.
Sire, they' ve sailed.
The last of their ships has gone to sea.
Sound the cry!
Light the victory torch.
Carry it through the streets.
Good.
- Our heroes would wish us to rejoice.
- Light the victory torch!
You' il see a Troy you' ve never known before.
I see it in your faces.
Open it!
Open it!
Let us look at the world again!
The night smiles on us.
Look, Priam.
I was trying to tell you of it, sire.
Some strange monument that the Greeks have left at our doorstep.
Beware the Greeks bearing gifts.
My sister speaks truly.
It is a thing of evil that should be burnt upon the plain.
I agree.
The enemy doesn' t give joyful presents.
My children, this is no gift from the Greeks...... but a symbol of worship they had to abandon.
Sire, the people beg permission to bring this amazing prize into the square.
I cannot deny them.
Father, please hear me.
It is not the end of ruin, but the beginning.
We must not be ungrateful...... to a goddess who has proved herself our goddess.
It shall be a monument to Trojan valor.
Yes, sire.
It is a great and perfect thing.
How childish I was to have misgivings.
And I to be afraid of a wooden giant.
What was that for?
Athena.
So forgiving of a rival goddess.
Are you jealous, Aphrodite?
I' m only Helen...... who wonders if she' il ever be a Trojan, really.
When the Trojan people look upon that plain...... won' t they always think of Helen of Sparta?
There is peace everywhere now.
We' re not bound to remain here.
Wherever you wish to go, Helen, I' il take you.
Hail to Prince Paris and his Helen!
Hail to Helen!
- All hail to Paris!
- Hail to Helen!
Destiny, Paris.
Destiny.
There is no escape, it seems.
Not even from happiness.
No, and I am happy.
Very happy.
Men of Sparta!
Men of Sparta, to the palace!
Forward!
Troy is lost, but you must not die.
While the Greeks plunder, make for the north gate.
- Or I?
Obey your king.
Aeneas, take care of Andromache and my grandson.
Paris, Helen...... I command you, go.
Magnificent leadership, Agamemnon.
Athena will reward you with all the glory.
All of you, break in!
Helen!
Take them!
Find her!
- Don' t let me get lost, Paris.
- Never.
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Oh, Paris!
Paris!
I thought I was lost!
Come.
Paris!
For a moment, I thought...
-... that you were that little slave girl.
- Oh, I am.
Whatever your love wishes me to be, whatever is in your heart.
You are my heart.
Paris.
No.
My ship has returned for you.
Go there.
Wash his blood from you.
That can never be.
It' s my blood.
{y: i} It can 't be lost, Paris, can it?
{y: i} What has been lived {y: i} and shared is never lost.
{y: i} Never, Helen.
{y: i} Then this is not goodbye.
{y: i} You shall always be with me.
{y: i} And you with me.
So you´re awake?
Fix something to eat.
I hope you like it.
Help yourself
Thank you.
I will.
Very Good.
Where´s the guy?
The man who brought you?
I did what i could...... but his wounds were too deep.
I see.
I have no family.
He was like a brother to me.
I´m sorry.
War is cruel to everyone.
Where is he?
I cleaned his body...... changed his kimono...... and laid him in another room.
You did?
That´s one more thing I must thank you for.
Don´t let it concern you.
This is a very unusual temple.
Are you it´s priest?
No.
It was derelict.
Not many come this deep into the mountains.
I don´t get along with people very well.
I´ve been living here for years.
I see.
And the lady?
Well, it´s a bit complicated.
She´s been here for years.
Anyway, what are you going to do?
Now?
Yes.
I´il take...
... his body back to his home.
I have no home, but he does.
That´s the only way I can mourn him.
Thank you for everything.
I´il take my leave.
What´s your hurry?
The enemy will be looking for you on the road you came.
To the west is a sheer cliff.
You could go down it, but in this rain...... it might collapse.
I say this for your own good.
Rest the night here.
I have few guests.
I dislike society, so I´ve retired to this temple.
I´m glad to have someone to drink with after so long.
I know, considering your friend, that this is not an auspicious encounter...... but perhaps this, too, is some kind of destiny.
Well?
Let´s drink the night away...... and sit vigil for him.
I´il take you up on that, then.
You have my thanks.
No, you have mine.
We´il make a night of it.
This is a drink called "wine", from a land called "France".
It´s made from grapes.
A strange taste...... but a good one.
Isn´t it?
Drink up!
This liquor, and this temple...
It´s all new to me.
Is all of this from foreign lands?
Yes.
I traveled far before I chanced upon this temple.
And that Buddha, is it foreign, too?
The face is strange.
I carved it.
You?
Yes. Living here, i have lots and lots of time.
It´s quite something!
It´s not so much Buddha as a carving of me.
Do you see?
Perhaps a little, now you mention it.
Speak your mind.
It´s a very heavy rain.
Well, it should stop by tomorrow.
The mountain roads are dangerous.
And there is a legend they tell of this mountain.
Do you know it?
No.
They say the long- nosed goblin haunts this mountain.
"Tengu"?
Who haunts this forest, who seizes men to eat?
The very same.
"Tengu" rules this mountain.
He hears the drop of a pin.
He sees a thousand leagues.
He scents the difference between a man´s blood and a beast´s...... and he eats only flesh.
But "Tengu" is just the name...... that people give him.
He´s really "Aragami"...... a fury of wild violence, the Raging God of Battle.
You seem to know this well.
But isn´t something as dangerous as that...... a threat to this temple?
Not really.
Because this "Aragami"...
... is me.
You had me there!
Sorry, sorry.
But "Tengu" legend is real.
Even if he did appear, you look like a strong man with a sword.
You could handle him.
What about you?
To survive that battle, and those wounds...
I´m sure more than a few men have fallen before you.
Tell me...... how many have you killed?
To count them would be in very bad taste.
Oh?
So you kill men in uncounted numbers...... and forget?
Shouldn´t you remember the lives you take?
I´ve killed 794.
I remember...... their shape, their voice...... the last look on their face...... everything.
May I see my friend?
He scents the difference between a man´s blood and a beast´s.
I smell it...
You reek of blood!
Enough!
You´re drunk.
I´il be on my way.
I´il come back and thank you properly.
Oh?
No, I´d like you to do that now.
I want you...
... to kill me.
Are you mad?
I told you...
I am Aragami.
But I´ve lived far too long.
I´ve been waiting for the one who will grant me death.
But it is not easy for Aragami...... to have himself killed.
Only a man worthy of the deed can cut me down.
This is crazy!
Why would I kill the man who saved my life?
That´s why I ask.
You´re in my dept.
Stop, will you?
You look like a man to me.
Not "Tengu" or "Aragami".
Not all is what it seems.
Not even a man.
One with a saintly face may betray you.
One with an innocent face may be prostitute.
One with an evil face may be good.
All right, let´s say you really are Aragami.
Why should I kill you?
Take me to my friend, damn it!
You´re a samurai.
You have a duty to accept my challenge.
Why do I have a duty to fight the man who saved my life?
You are no longer who you were when you came.
Think about it.
Isn´t it strange?
You came here two days ago...... with 13 sword cuts and four arrows stuck in you.
Your wounds had festered, and you had a high fever.
And now?
Once a crazed lord kidnapped large numbers of small babies.
He believed he needed them to concoct a potion of immortality.
He thought newborns held untold possibility...
... as nourishment... in the treatment of wounds of disease and old age.
Now, while this lord...... was simply a lunatic...... his idea was not completely wrong.
There is a mysterious power...... in human flesh.
My friend...
Where is he?
To take your body...... past its limits...... the human liver is best.
Yes.
You ate the flesh of your friend.
He bacame part of you, and gave you strength...... otherwise you were dead by now.
You bastard!
I understand how you feel.
How about another drink first.
What are you?
Hey, hey, hey!
Will you look at this sword!
It´s about ready to snap.
This looks like it could be fun.
The night´s still young.
Let´s take our time.
Shut up!
Huh?
You go too far!
Stop looking like you´re dying.
It´s just a scratch.
Hey... hey.
Give it a rest.
See?
But you aren´t immortal, you know.
The head...
... or the heart kills you.
Anyway, let´s have another drink.
Now, this liquor is from a land called Russia.
They call it vodka.
It´s pretty strong.
It´s from corn.
Anyway, have a drink.
Do you think I´m giong to just sit and drink?!
How come I´m not dead?!
I told you.
You ate the liver...
So you just eat someone´s liver and you don´t die?
Don´t be silly.
Look.... no two cooks make the same thing the same way.
This woman is a good cook.
An excellent one.
So.
Are you a demon, too?
It´s been said that women are devils, hasn´t it?
She´s more a devil than I am.
While you´re at it...... could you kill her, too?
Hey!
What´s in that?!
I said it was strong.
What do you want?
Why are you doing this to me?!
How many times do I have to tell you?
I want to die.
Fighting is the only reason to live.
I´ve always hoped I´d meet someone stronger...... but I´m tired
This body of mine will never get any older.
I´m not able to die naturally
Why not cut your stomach open, then?
Don´t ask me to kill you!
Hara- kiri?
That´s something mortals do from excessive self- respect...... and stupid pride.
I am without fault.
Why would I do that?
Besides.
I am Aragami, the Raging God of Battle.
I was born to die in battle.
And i can´t be cut down by some backwoods samurai.
No.
I will die when I encounter the one.
Sophistry.
Nothing you say makes any sense at all!
It´s absurd!
Then let me ask you...... do mortals make sense?
Shabby politicians start wars where you kill each other by the thousand.
Isn´t that the reason you´re here, and your friend is dead?
Isn´t that absurd?
Listen...... the existence of this world is absurd.
All right, then.... why did you kill him and choose me?
You were both half- dead.
I could only save one.
But why me and not him?
No reason.
I just chose you, that´s all.
Would you rather you´d died and been eaten instead?
And look, I didn´t kill him.
I gave you the chance to survive.
I could have let you both die.
But, now you have the chance to live.
There´s a big difference.
Consider yourself lucky you have the chance.
Make the best of it.
Who do you think you are?!
You bring people here to split hairs, and then kill them.
What chance have I got?
It´s just murder!
Not all the ones I killed were people.
They weren´t?
Wher´d he go?
Sometimes demons or goblins look like people.
There are beings in the world that are beyond imagination.
They made me realize that I wasn´t human...... that I was Aragami.
Demons, goblins, Aragami... what are you talking about?
As I told you, the world isn´t always what it seems.
Many who look human aren´t so at all.
Miraculous survivors of disease or accident...
People say they´re lucky...... but that´s not it.
Thy´re human, but then again they´re not.
Oh, I get it.
If you´re Aragami, maybe I am, too.
Maybe.
That´s not true!
Neither of us looks anything other than human.
Some birds fly high up in the sky, but some never leave the ground.
It´s not strange that humans come in different forms.
My being here...... is proof of existence beyond what is known.
I say white, you say black.
I just don´t see it.
No, you wouldn´t.
I used to think I was human, too.
I went looking for battle from the moment I was born...... and I fought lots of men.
No one could beat me.
I couldn´t help wondering why I was so strong.
And then in time the whole world knew my name.
I became feared
No man would face me in a fair fight any more.
Wait...
What is that name the whole world knew?
Who, me?
Yeah.
Miyamoto Musashi.
Musashi?
You´re the Musashi who never met his match?
It doesn´t matter now what my name was.
But he died years ago!
Yeah, that´s what I heard.
You know "rumors".
You´re history´s greatest samurai in the world?... and also you´re an inhuman Aragami?
Is that it?
Yeah, something like that.
And you want me to fight a monster like you?
That´s right.
What an idiot!
Ow!
That hurts!
Sorry, sorry.
You´re Musashi!
Ow!
Ow!
Give me a break!
What the hell.
I´ve already died once.
Alright.
Your sword´s no good any more.
Take what you like.
No, not that one.
That´s mine.
You said to take one.
Sorry.
I recommend...... that western one.
It´s called a "broadsword".
It´s heavy, and it cuts.
The owners of these weapons are all dead...... so feel free.
Forget that sickle- and- chain.
The room´s too small.
Too many pillars.
How will a bear´s- claw help?
Ninja stars are for losers.
That gun´s good.
It´s a "pistol".
The latest weapon from the west.
It fires a bullet with gunpowder, like a matchclock.
It won´t be easy to hit me with it, of course.
Hey, wait a minute.
Shooting me when I was asleep wouldn´t be much fun.
I thought I´d wake you up.
I am not able to sleep.
Tell me...... have you ever dreamed?
Of course.
I dont sleep, so I never have.
That´s too bad.
A good dream is fun.
I´d like to try it someday... dreaming.
About the gun...
You have to pull the hammer back to fire.
That was your friend´s sword.
It´s a good one.
Killing me with it would be a nice way to mourn.
So that´s your choice?
So you mean to win...
You´re my kind.
We can´t turn away from fighting.
If we´re the same kind, and you´re Aragami...... what does that make me?
Beat me and you´il find out.
I´m glad we met.
That´s a sneaky trick!
Yes!
I like that!
That´s why I chose you.
This is the central moment of your life.
Stake body and soul, present. past and future...... and show me!
You´re the man I chose.
Can´t you do better than that?
The hammer...
You won´t beat me with that.
I guess not.
I thought maybe he was the one.
Is there no one in this world who can stand against me?
He was a real samurai.
Give him a good funeral.
You?
The world isn´t always what it seems.
Didn´t you say that?
Yes, I did.
I´m sure you have no equal under heaven.
But look up...... there´re millions of stars above.
You´ve made me realize what I really am.
This is indeed a world of wonder.
Fascinating.
You´re the one I´ve been waiting for.
You weren´t waiting for me.
I was searching for you.
Thanks.
This is the best moment in my life.
What manner of being are you?
Beat me and you´il find out.
I see...
The world is so wide, and still full of mystery...
Now you can sleep.
I can?
So this is sleep...
Hey...
... do you think...... I can dream, too?
Yeah.
I wonder what he´s dreaming...
What will you do?
I´il stay here...
... with you.
You will stay here...... and continue your battle.
Oh, well...
I´ve got nowhere to go.
I guess I´il stay.
Aragami...
I wonder who´s going to beat me.
I´il be here to see.
They say Japan was made by a sword
They say the old gods dipped the coral blade into the ocean
When they pulled it out four perfect drops fell back into the sea those drops became the islands of Japan
I say Japan was made by a handful of brave men
Warriors willing to give their lives for what seems to have become a forgotten word...
Honor
"The Last Samurai"
Ladies and Gentlemen... the Winchester an American leader in all forms of armament used by the United States Army celebrates our nation' s centenial by bringing you a true American hero.
One of our most decorated warriors this country has ever known... winner of the medal of honor for his gallantry on the arena of battle each time.
He' s late of the seventh cavalry and a triumph campaign... against the most savage of Indian nations.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...
Captain Nathan Algren.
Captain Nathan Algren!
Yes!
Yes!
Please, one moment, thank you.
God damn you, Algren!
Get out of there!
This is your last performance, you are fired.
Now get out!
Come on!
I' m sick of this, come on!
Yes!
You are too kind.
This, ladies and gents, is the gun that' s winning the west.
I... many' s the time, I found myself... surrounded by a squad of wrath...... angry hostiles. with nothing but this rifle, between me and their certain and gruesome death.
But let me tell you folks... the "redman" doesn' t fear his enemy.
If He' d had his way, this scalp of mine will be long gone... and then there will be a bald man standing before you today.
Would those poor bastards attack there... and a little bit more.
Bodies slit about... literally.
after rotted in the sun.
This, ladies and ladies, 73 lever- action... chamber...
7- shot capacity, accurate at 400 yards, one round per second...
Son, you' ve seen what this could do with a man?
It' s blown a hole in your daddy 16 inches wide.
It' s tragic
This beauty, it kills some five, six, seven braves... without ever having to reload.
Note the patented loading port... and the smooth cocking action.
My thanks, on behalf of those who died in the name of better mechanical amusements... and commercial opportunities.
Mr. McCabe, come here to take the orders
God bless you all.
I was seeking out to heat the flame for the old melodrama.
- You are alive.
- I' m indeed.
You mind, Custer said to me, "we' re going to the Little BigHorn since I want those weird stuff to walk into take- up for me."
Now many things happened, I will tell you what else happened.
I have a good job for the both of us.
God knows specially you' re gonna need one for yourself.
What kind of a job?
The only job you will think you are loyal.
A man' s job!
Unless of course you give your heart in the career in the theater.
Nathan!
You just listen to 'em.
Don' t you bother to say.
For a while, it' s good to see you.
Nathan Algren, I would like you to meet Mr. Omura, from Japan. and his associate, his name I' ve given up try to pronounce.
Sit down, please.
Whiskey.
Now Japan' s got that in mind to become a civilized country.
And Mr. Omura here is...... willing to spend whatever it takes to hire a wise expert to train their army.
And he prepared a contract the Emperor grants the U. S... exclusive rights to supply arms.
I have an agreement with the Winchester company, and I am certain that Mr. Omura here has some concept of what an agreement is.
Your performances for the Winchester company bring you $25 a week.
We will pay you $400 a month.
$5 for each. and another $500 when we get the job done.
How many other genuine war heroes you got lined up?
He' s rude
That' s how it is here.
A land of cheap traders.
Whiskey.
So, who will be it - training your boys to fight against?
His name is Kasumoto Moritsu.
He was last Emperor' s teacher.
He is a samurai.
Samurai?
The word you might use it as "warrior"
Mr. Omura is familiar... with our experience in dealing with renegade.
What is it?
It' s going to read your book.
Captain Algren studied of a trial, which was a crucial fact on the defeat of the Cheyennes.
Please excuse
What is funny?
Because... back together again is so...... inspiring
Excuse me
Sorry for this.
This isn' t a problem
I' il just talk to him for a minute.
Colonel Bagley.
We contacted you because you are Captain Algren' s superior officer... and you' ve assured us of his participation.
I' il do it.
I just need a minute.
Nathan.
I did what I was ordered to do up there.
And I have no remorse.
What did you see through the past behind us?
You want me to kill Jappos?
I will kill Jappos.
I am not asking you to kill anybody, but the enemy...
Kill the enemy if it is Jappo.
Reb, Sioux, Cheyenne...
For 500 bucks a month, I will kill whoever you want.
But keep one thing in mind...
I' d be happy to kill you for free.
June 12th, 1876.
There is some comfort in the emptiness in the sea.
No past, no future.
And I once am confronted by the hard truth of the present circumstances.
I have been hired to help supress the rebellion of another tribal leader.
Apparently, this is the only job for which I am suited.
I am upset by the ironies of my life.
Yokohama Harbor, 1876
Captain Algren, I presume?
Yes
I presume that good.
How do you do?
Simon Graham.
20 years ago, this was a sleepy little town.
Now, look at this.
You see, the emperor is mad for all thing western. and the Samurais believe that it' s changing too fast.
The ancient and the modern are at war for the soul of Japan.
So your new employer, Mr. Omura... is bringing in every western expert he can get his hands on.
Lawyers of France, engineers of Germany... architects of Holland and now of course, warriors of America.
I came when I was with the British legation, know, years ago...
I was soon relieved of my position where I have a long long forest of tendencies to tell the truth... in a country where they never say what they need.
So now, I very accurately translate the other people' s lives.
For 2000 years, no Emperor was even seen by a commoner.
You have to realise this accidental chance is an honor.
This is all highly ritualism, of course.
You may look at him, but do not speak.
Unless you are spoken to, obviously.
If he stands, you must bow.
If he bows, you must bow lower.
Do I look presentable?
I' ve wantoned a decade...... on the smart round midgets.
and bow
The Emperor Meiji bids you welcome.
He' s grateful for the assistance your country offers.
We hope to accomplish the same national harmony you enjoy in your homeland.
If you have fought against them in battle?
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is brutal ass.
The Emperor wishes to ask Captain Algren if it is truth that... they wear eagle feathers and paint their faces before going into battle. and then they have no fear.
They are very brave.
Bow
Thank you very much.
Step back step back.. step back and turn.
All right, you little bastards, you should stand up straight in a line... or I will passionately shit- kick every one of you sad parade, let it be before my eyes.
Well done, Sergeant.
When you understand the language, everything is as fast as it takes place.
The first right you' il know: rifles at the ready.
The second right...
July 27th, 1876.
For six months of work, I' m to receive...... 3 years of a Captain' s pay, teaching oriental soldiers.
They are army of conscription... most of them are peasants, who have never seen a gun.
Fire!
They are led by General Hasegawa... a man of small stature and nonetheless commands enormous respect.
- Katsumoto.
He seems to have great knowledge of Katsumoto, his rebellion.
I' il count on his help when facing this samurai.
Who supply them with weapons?
Katsumoto no longer dishonours himself by using firearms.
He uses no firearms?
Those honor the old way, Katsumoto is a hero.
How well does he know this man?
Well, the General and Katsumoto fought together for the Emperor.
He fought with the samurai?
He is a samurai.
You have to understand Katsumoto pledged the sword to defend the Emperor.
They say the samurai' s sword is his soul.
They are paradoxical people, samurai.
I' ve tried to write a book about them for years...
I seeked in vain to approach them close.
He' s characterized them as the most sophisticated warriors on earth.
I need more detailed information of their battle tactics.
I have several more books just waiting to be translated.
Our captain will be speaking the language of theirs.
You should' ve heard him babbling on the Blackfoot.
Really?
A fellow linguist?
Oh, Capital!
Oh come on Sir, a word or two is very fun.
Just "hello" or "Goodbye".
No, No.. Cut its tongue and boil in the oil.
Early this morning we have a dull work. so it is bed time, isn' t it?
I once had a dread fascination for scalp.
I never understood its technique.
Imagine someone who hates you with the uppermost intensity.
Grabbing in hand full of your hair while you are lying prostrate and helpless.
And scraping a dull blade of a rusted knife on your scalp... with the soulless emotion.
and let your imagination grasp you can, Mr. Graham, the effect of a strong, quick jerk- out on the turf of your hair. to release clinging part, of course you have, of your nervous system.
You will have some idea of what the hell it is to be scalped.
Mr. Graham.
How soon can you translate those books?
Right away.
Just delighted to do it, with your such an interest in Samurai.
I don' t give a damn about the Samurai.
I want to know my enemy.
I shall not sleep until it is done.
Ah... foggy
Have a good night.
Can I get your answer?
This is a pureness expedition, Captain.
Colonel Bagley, these people have nothing to do with the race.
Good night, Sir.
Fire!
I suppose we should be grateful for our fire army to shoot in the same direction. could not put it better myself, Sir.
Rifle butt against your shoulder.
Eye down the side, now slowly...
Fire!
Well done.
Nathan...
Katsumoto attacked the railroad in the border of his province. we cannot govern a country in which we cannot travel freely.
He must be stopped now.
My railroad is a priority for this country.
They are not ready.
The rebels don' t have a single rifle.
They' re savages with bows and arrows. whose sole occupation for the last 1000 years has been at war.
You have superior fire power and a larger force.
I am ordering the regiment to move against the rebel Katsumoto.
You will track him down and engage him.
Mr. Graham... tell these men to fire at me.
I beg your pardon?
Tell these men if he does not shoot me...
I will kill him.
Captain, could I make them awarded?
Kill him
Load.
Stop!
Faster!
Faster!
Shoot me, damn it.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
They are not ready.
The regiment leaves at 6: 00 A. M.
1, 000 miles of rail track laid in less than 2 years.
It' s astonished.
No more owns all these.
As soon as we exempt with the Samurai.
How do you intend to find Katsumoto?
Don' t worry, Mr. Graham.
I assure you... he will find us.
Hold your position!
Yoshino Province, 1876.
First Company, follow up the back line around me!
Second Company, follow up First Company.
Third and Fourth Company follow up!
To be at my command!
- Where is Hasegawa?
- Unclear, he refused to fight against Katsumoto.
- Come on now!
- Captain Algren... we are not here for combatness.
Then who' s gonna lead these men?
Their own officers, for Chris sake, let' s move to the rear.
I' il be present there.
Change for the rear.
Change for the rear.
- Mr. Graham, you' il accompany me to the rear, okay?
- Of course.
Seize the disposition of the supply train.
Sergeant Gant, did you hear my order?
I did hear it, Sir.
Good, then obey it.
Now!
No disrespecting intended, Sir, we should look up our ass.
- Load!
- Load!
Samurai come.
You will be fine, Son.
- Assume firing position!
- Assume firing position!
Fire on my order only!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Reload!
Hold the line!
Fire at will!
Fall back!
Gant!
He' s mine.
Stop!
Take him away.
What is your name?
Insolent swine!
Answer!
Leave him be.
This is my son' s village.
We are deep in the mountains and the winter is coming.
You cannot escape.
It' s surely good.
My Lord, why do you spare the barbarian?
He is ashamed in defeat.
He should kill himself.
This is not their custom.
Then...... I will kill him.
I don' t think...
Ujio...... there will be plenty of killing to come.
For now...... we will learn about our new enemy.
Keep him alive.
He' s in bad shape.
Sake...
Sake?
Sake...
Sake...
Taka will take care of you.
Sake...
Sake...
Sake...
Let him drink, aunt.
No.
That will not do.
This is my village.
This is my house.
Please... sake..
Sugay!
No!
No!
I told you!
Morning.
Over there.
Over there!
What' s your name?
You have a name, don' t you?
Naomei?
Naomai?
You don' t know what I' m saying, do you?
I know why you don' t talk.
You' re angry.
You' re angry because I made you wear a dress.
Son of a bitch.
This temple was built by my family 1, 000 years ago.
My name is Katsumoto.
What is your name?
Are my words not correct?
I will practise my English with you... if you would honor me...
You keep me alive just to speak English?
What do you want?
To know my enemy.
I' ve seen what you did with your enemies.
The warriors in its country do not kill?
They don' t cut their heads off to free the kneeling men.
General Hasegawa asked me to help him end his life.
A samurai cannot stand the shame of defeat.
I was honored to cut off his head.
Many of our customs seem strange to you... and the same is true of yours.
For example...
Not to introduce yourself is considered extremely rude, even among enemies.
Nathan Algren.
I am honored to meet you.
I have enjoyed this conversation in English.
I have questions.
I have introduced myself, you have introduced yourself.
This is a very good conversation.
I have questions!
- Questions come later.
- Who was the warrior in the red armor?
My brother- in- law, Hirotaro. and the woman who cares for me?
My sister, Hirotaro' s wife.
Her name is Taka.
I killed her husband?
It was a good death!
You!
Douzo!
[Japanese]
(please!)
He smells like the pigs.
Tell my brother I cannot stand this.
Why don' t you tell him?
At least make him take a bath.
Nicely done!
They may be children, but they are strong.
You try.
Fight!
Put down the sword.
I just realised...
I' ve been remiss.
Forgive me I... forget to thank you for looking out for me yesterday.
It' s your job, correct?
Protecting me.
Well done, "Bob".
You don' t mind if I call you "Bobby"?
I knew a Bob once.
God, he' s a grist mill.
You hear this man, Bob?
Ujio was teaching you the way of Japanese sword.
Yes, indeed.
You fought against the red indians?
Yes.
Tell me the real part in this war.
- Why?
- I wish to learn.
Read the book.
I' d rather to have a good conversation.
- Why?
- Because... to read a book constitutes a work.
So... you were the General of your army?
No...
I was a Captain.
This is a lower rank?
a middle rank
Then who was the General?
Don' t you have a rebellion to lead?
People in your country do not like conversation?
He was a Lieutenant- Colonel.
His name is Custer.
I know this name.
He killed many warriors.
Aye.
Many warriors.
So he was a good General.
No, he wasn' t a good General, he was arrogant, foolhardy. and he got massacred because he took a single battallion...... against 2, 000 angry indians.
2, 000 indians?
How many men for Custer?
- 200.
- I like this General Custer.
He was a murderer, who fell in love with his own legend. and his troops died for it.
I think this is a very good death.
Oh, maybe you can have one just like it someday.
If it is my destiny.
What you want from me?
What do you want for yourself?
What are you doing?
Why we have these conversations?
What the hell am I doing here?
In spring, the snow will melt and passage will open.
Until that time, you are here.
Good day, Captain.
1876... day unknown, month unknown.
I continue to live among these unusual people.
I' m a captive and I cannot escape.
Mostly I' m treated with a kind of a mind of regret as if I was a street dog, an unwelcome guest.
Everyone is polite, everyone smiles and bows.
Higen
They are intriguing people.
From the moment they wake... they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue.
I' ve never seen such a discipline.
I' m surprised to learn that the word "Samurai" means...... "to serve". and Katsumoto believes his rebellion to be in the service of the Emperor.
Please forgive, too many mind.
Too many mind?
Mind the sword, mind the people watch, mind the enemy.
Too many mind.
No mind.
No mind.
Thank you.
More rice?
Taka.
He spoke Japanese!
Eat a lot.
Don' t polite.
Not so fast.
Hashi (Chopstick)
How can he understand?
Hana (Nose)
Mimi (Ear)
Not so fast.
Algren.
- Nobutada.
- Nobutada.
- Magojiro.
- Magojiro.
- Higen.
- Higen.
Taka.
Brother, please make him leave.
I cannot stand it.
Is he so repulsive?
The shame is unbearable.
I ask permission to end my life.
You will do as you are told!
You' d rather I kill him to avenge your husband?
Yes
Hirotaro tried to kill the American.
It was karma.
Yes, I know
Forgive my weakness.
There must be some reason why he is here.
It is beyond my understanding.
She has been very kind to me.
She is honored to help my guest in her house.
Winter, 1877.
What does it mean to be a Samurai?
To devote yourself utterly to a set of moral principles.
To seek the stillness of your mind.
And to master the realm of sword.
He is getting better, no?
(I feel cold too) also... watashi the fire.
(fire)
Hidaga
Moeru... to burn.
Moeru
Hidaga moeru
No, please.
Japanese men do not help with this.
I am not Japanese.
I' m sorry gomennasai (Excuse me)
Gomennasai for your husband... Hirotaro.
He did his duty.
You did your duty.
I accept your apology... hahaue (mom)
Spring, 1877.
It is much longer than I have stayed in one place...... since I left the farm at 17.
There are so much here that I will never understand.
I have never been a church- going man.
And what I have seen on the field of battle have left me to question on God' s purpose.
But there is indeed something spiritual in this place.
I cannot but be aware of its power.
I do know it is here that I have known my first untroubled sleep in many years.
You gotta get the ball!
Not me
You gotta get the ball! the ball!
Ujio will win in three moves.
In five!
Next in five moves.
In six.
A draw!
Who is this amateur?
Katsumoto!
Protect Katsumoto!
Protect our Lord!
Lord, please go inside!
A perfect blossom is a rare thing.
You could spend your life looking for them... and it will not be a wasted life.
Who sent those men to kill you?
I am writing a poem about a dream I had. the tigers' eyes are like my own.
He comes from across a deep and trouble to see.
Was it the Emperor?
Omura?
If the Emperor wishes my death, he is but to ask.
So it was Omura.
I' m having trouble finishing the poem.
Can you transact a last line?
I am not a writer.
Yes, you have written many pages since you came here.
What has he told you?
You have nightmares.
Every soldier has nightmares.
Only one who is ashamed of what he has done.
Go away!
You have seen many things.
I have.
You do not fear that, but sometimes you wish for it.
Is it not so?
Yes.
I hope so.
It just happens to a man who has seen what we have seen.
I will remember, like these blossom, we are all dying.
To know life in every breath...... every couple of tea, every life we take. the way of the warrior
The life in every breath.
That is "Bushido".
The Emperor has granted the safe passage to Tokyo.
We leave tomorrow.
- Good.
- Good.
when I took this, you were my enemy.
Excuse me.
No, so sorry.
I am finishing.
Hai (Yes)
You have been kind to me.
I won' t forget
Algren- san.
Go!
Algren?
Algren, my God, you are alive.
Will you never cease to astonish?
Howitzer
Yes, indeed.
Soon the Emperor signs the damn trade agreement.
He gets the whole package... including this particular item.
200 rounds a minute. and the new cartridge just cut down on jamming.
I need a bath.
After living with those savages, I can only imagine.
Welcome back, Captain.
You rise against me, my teacher.
No, Highness.
I rise against your enemies.
They are my advisors, like you.
They advise in their own interest.
I need advisors who know the modern world.
If I am no use, I will happily end my life.
No...
I need your voice in the council.
It is your voice we need, Highness.
You are a living God.
Do what you think is right.
I am a living God...... as long as I do what they think is right.
What sad words you speak...
Forgive me for saying what a teacher must.
Have you forgotten your people?
Tell me what to do...... my teacher.
You are Emperor, my Lord, not me.
You must find the wisdom for all of us.
Ah, gentlemen, come in.
Captain Algren, it seems you have endured your captivity with little ill effect.
I was not ill- treated, Sir.
Mr. Omura, I have here a draft of the arms agreement.
Captain Algren, I' m eager to know how many Samurai have joined in Katsumoto.
I' m afraid I don' t know.
You spent the entire winter in his encampment.
I was a prisoner.
Was it far to find his position? has he acquired firearms?
Come man, tell us what you saw.
As you said, Colonel, they are savages... with bows and arrows.
- Sir, about...
- I' m sure your documents are in order, ambassador, thank you.
If you leave them on my desk, I' il have a read at my appropriate time.
With all due respect, Sir. our president' s patience is wearing thin.
Perhaps there' s someone else we should be speaking to.
Perhaps there' s someone else we should be speaking to.
For instance, French or the English, or with any of the legations waiting in the next room.
Yes. well, we should be looking forward to hearing from you.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Perhaps you and I might have a while in private.
Please, sit down.
May I offer you a whiskey?
No, thank you.
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man, is he not?
He is a tribal leader.
I' ve known many of them.
But now who are Samurai, their way is a great appeal.
I don' t see others concerns me.
Ah, but it does.
Captain Algren.
Last year we were not prepared to go to battle.
You were right and Colonel Bagley was wrong.
But now we are ready.
If Katsumoto is allowed to attract the other Samurai to his cause, we will have 10 years of barbarian.
This is something I will not allow.
Either I' il stop him in the council today. or you will lead my army against him. and with these new weapons, you will crash him.
I appreciate the offer.
It is not an offer.
Mr. Omura, my contract with you, was to train your army.
One that recognizes the extraordinary contribution you have made to the Emperor.
Do we understand each other?
Yes, we understand each other perfectly.
Then I am pleased.
Follow him.
If he goes anywhere near Katsumoto, kill him.
Captain Algren, what in heaven is this going on?
The diplomatic news are fast.
Omura has passed the laws against Samurais.
Mr. Graham, I need a drink.
He is your friend, Katsumoto, we can come to go up against the council this afternoon.
You, Samurai!
Don' t you know about the order?
Oh my God, it starts.
Hey boy, are you listening?
No wonder the foreigners mock you.
Let' s give this Samurai a haircut.
Cut off his top knot.
Get down!
Kneel!
Captain Algren
Lower your weapons!
Lower your weapons!
Who are you?
I am Captain Algren.
Stop!
Get down!
Let' s go.
I' il take you home.
Okay
We must resist the western powers...... by becoming powerful ourselves.
Our army, our economy must be strong.
Minister, you honor us.
It is my honor to rejoin this council.
Perhaps you are unaware of the law against wearing sword.
I read every law carefully.
Yet you bring weapons into this chamber?
This chamber was protected by my sword when...
We need no protection.
We are a nation of laws.
We are a nation of whores, selling ourselves...
If we are whores, the Samurai made us this way.
I have not seen the Omura family giving gold to the masses.
Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regreat... but I must ask you to remove your sword.
This sword serves the Emperor... only he can command me to remove it.
The Emperor' s voice is too pure to be heard in this council.
Then, I must refuse to give up my sword.
Then regretfully, my guards will accompany you to your home in Tokyo.
There you will await our summons.
I heard you are leaving
Omura offers my job and you run away.
I suppose I should thank you. $500 a month, including back pay for time spent... in captivity.
That is enough to come back inside the barrel for the rest of your life.
You are welcome.
Well, and this is putting in my drawer.
Katsumoto is under arrest, Omura won' t let him last the night.
With Katsumoto dead, we should get little trouble handling the rest of the rebellion.
Even without you.
Specially without you.
Just tell me one thing
What is it about your own people that you hate so much?
Save us the trouble...
The Samurai are finished!
Stop!
Don' t come any closer!
Don' t stop.
Whatever you do, don' t stop.
Minister Omura has commanded us to photograph the traitor.
Stop!
Somebody!
Bring that equipment here NOW!
Immediately!
You stop!
You insolent, useless son of a peasant dog!
How dare you show your sword in his presence!
Do you know who this is?
This is the President of the United States of America.
He is here to lead our armies in victorious battle against the rebels!
It' s not my responsibility...
Now get over there and help those men with their equipment!
Carry the equipment.
President of the United States?
Sorry, I think I made you sick.
How is your poem coming?
The end is proving difficult.
This is Mr. Simon Graham.
He would like very much to take you a photograph.
I thought you returned to America.
I decided to stay.
See if I could convince you to escape.
How do you think to do that?
Mr. Graham, perhaps you would care to take pictures of my village.
I will be greatly honored.
My Lord, no!
Nobutada!
Father, let me stay.
It is my time.
My lord...... we must go.
The Emperor could not hear my words.
His army will come here.
It is the end.
For 900 years, my ancestors have protected our people.
Now...
I have failed them.
So you' re taking your own life...
... in shame.
Shame for a life for "Service, Discipline, Compassion"
The way of the Samurai is not necessary any more.
Necessary?
What can be more necessary?
I' d rather die by the sword.
my own or my enemies'
Then let it be your enemies'.
Together, we will make the Emperor hear you.
He was a good man.
Will you fight the white men, too?
If they come here, yes.
Why?
Because they come to destroy what I have come to love.
The way of Samurai is difficult for children, he misses his father.
And he is angry because I am the cause of that.
No.
He is angry because he fears you will die as well.
My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.
That is what he believed.
I would be afraid to die in battle.
So would I
But you have been in many battles.
And I was always afraid.
I don' t want you to go.
Algren
They are coming.
I take 2- 4 regiments.
Come in the waves of a thousand.
- They may have a howitzer.
- It makes no difference.
They will come in the way where we make up a stand.
How many men we have?
Maybe 500.
Like the general Custer, huh?
There was once a battle at a place called Thermopylae.
300 brave Greeks held off Persian army of a million men. a million, you understand this number?
I understand this number.
For two days, the Greeks made them pay so dearly...... the Persian army lost their strong taste for battle.
And they were defeated soon after.
What do you have in mind?
Take away the advantage of their guns.
I' m confident we can use that.
Move them close, close enough for a sword.
You believe a man can change his destiny?
I think a man does what he can... until his destiny is revealed.
May 25th, 1877.
This will be the last entry in this journal.
I try to give a true account of what I' ve seen, what I' ve done.
I do not presume to understand the course of my life.
But I know I' m grateful to a part taken in all of this.
Even if for a moment.
Algren- san, will you come with me?
If you wear this armor, it will honor us.
You will need this.
What does it say?
I belong to the warrior in whom the older ways have joined the new.
Good God!
Sir, The Imperial Army of Japan demands your surrender.
If you and your fellows lay down your arms, you will not be harmed.
This is not possible, as Mr. Omura knows
Captain Algren... we will show you no quarter.
You rise against us.
You will be the same as they are.
I will look for you on the field.
- Captain Algren - Yes, Mr. Graham
Perhaps you could use this for your book.
Yes, I will.
Captain...
- Godspeed.
- Mr. Graham.
Well, they won' t surrender.
Are we ready?
Test!
Fire!
They are covering their retreat.
You see, even the mightiest Samurai cannot stand up to our howitzer.
It seems they are attacked.
I advise sending skirmish first.
Nonsense!
Step forward!
They are coming.
Second volley.
Set fire
What on earth!
What is happening?
Their attack has been stopped.
Sending the rest of the regiment.
What happened to the warriors in Thermopylae?
Dead to the last man.
Algren- san
They' re once again winning.
There' il be two more regiments up here this time.
we won' t be able to stop them again.
You don' t have to die here.
I should' ve died so many times as before.
Now you live again.
Yes.
It is not your time.
It' s not over.
Cannon, prepare to fire!
Prepare to fire!
This is madness.
Is he going to attack?
Yes.
He is defeated.
He must accept his shame.
Kill them back.
Block them.
Now!
My horse!
Fire!
Attempt
Attempt
Fire!
Fire at will!
Bring up the new guns!
Prepare the new guns!
Fire!
Quickly!
Quickly!
Fire!
Stop firing!
Idiots, keep on firing!
Stop firing!
Stop!
No...
Shoot!
Kill Katsumoto!
Kill the American!
You have your honor again.
Let me die with mine.
Help me up.
Are you ready?
I will miss our conversations.
perfect...
They are all perfect.
On behalf of the United States of America, the signing of this treaty... will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity... and cooperation between our two great nations.
On behalf of the Emperor... we are pleased to have successfully concluded this...
... negotiation.
He is here?
Highness, if we could just conclude the matter at hand...
This is Katsumoto' s sword.
He would have wanted you to have it...... that the strength of the Samurai be with you always.
Enlightened One, we all weep for Katsumoto, but...
He hoped, with his last breath...... that you would remember the ancestors who held this sword...... and what they died for.
Your Highness.
Hai.
Emperor, this man fought against you.
Your Highness, if you believe me to be your enemy.
Command me... and I will gladly take my life.
I have dreamed of a unified Japan.... of a country strong and independent and modern... and now, we have railroads, and cannons, western clothing.
But...
we cannot forget who we are...... or where we come from.
I have concluded that this treaty is not in the best interests of my people.
Sir, if I may...
So sorry, but you may not.
This is an outrage!
Enlighted One, we should discuss this...
Omura...... you have done quite enough.
Everything I have done, I have done for my country.
Then you will not mind when I seize your family' s assets...... and present them as my gift to the people.
You disgrace me.
If your shame is too unbearable...
I offer you this sword.
Tell me how he died.
I will tell you how he lived.
And so the days of the Samurai had ended.
Nations, like men, it' s sometimes said, have their own destiny.
As for the American Captain, no one knows what became of him.
Others...... he returned to his own country.
But I like to think, he may have at last found some small measure of peace...... that we all seek, and few of us ever find.
By 300 AD, the Roman Empire extended from Arabia to Britain.
But they wanted more.
More land.
More peoples loyal and subservient to Rome.
But no people so important as the powerful Sarmatians to the east.
Thousands died on that field.
And when the smoke cleared on the fourth day, the only Sarmatian soldiers left alive were members ofthe decimated but legendary cavalry.
The Romans, impressed by theirbravery and horsemanship, spared theirlives.
452 AD
In exchange, these warriors were incorporated into the Roman military.
(neighing)
Father.
They are here.
For the secondpart ofthe bargain they struck indebted not only themselves...
The day has come... but also theirsons, and theirsons, and so on, to serve the empire as knights.
I was such a son.
There is a legend that fallen knights return as great horses.
He has seen what awaits you, and he will protect you.
Lancelot!
Lancelot!
I will return.
- How long shall we be gone?
Lancelot!
(all shout out "Rus! ')
(Lancelot) Ourpost was Britain - orat least the southern half, for the land was divided by a 73- mile wall built three centuries before us to protect the empire from the native fighters ofthe north.
So, as ourforefathers had done, we made our way and reported to ourRoman commanderin Britain, ancestrally named for the firstArtorius, orArthur.
1 5 YEARS LATER
Ah, as promised, the bishop' s carriage.
- Our freedom, Bors.
(horse whinnies)
Argh!
(warcries)
Woads!
(uproar, swords clinking)
Yaa- rgh!
Yah!
Argh!
Argh!
(triumphant cry)
Aagh!
Rus.
Gratia plena, Dominus tecum.
Benedicta tu in mulieribus et Dominus tecum.
Benedicta tu in mulieribus.
Benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus.
Benedicta tu in mulieribus...
Save your prayers, boy.
Your god doesn' t live here.
Why did Merlin send you south of the wall?
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
- Bors.
- What a bloody mess.
That' s not the bishop.
God help us.
- What are they?
- Blue demons that eat Christians alive.
You' re not a Christian, are you?
Does this really work?
(mutters gibberish)
Maybe I' m not doin 'it right.
(man chuckling) Arthur!
Arthur Castus.
Your father' s image.
I haven' t seen you since childhood.
Bishop Germanius.
Welcome to Britain.
I see your military skills are still of use to you.
Your device worked.
Ancient tricks of an ancient dog.
And these are the great Sarmatian knights we have heard so much of in Rome.
I thought the Woads control the north of Hadrian' s Wall.
They do, but they occasionally venture south.
Rome' s anticipated withdrawal from Britain has only increased their daring.
- (man) Woads?
- British rebels who hate Rome.
Men who want their country back.
- Who leads them?
- He' s called Merlin.
A dark magician, some say.
Tristan, ride ahead and make sure the road is clear.
Please do not worry, Bishop.
Oh.
I' ve no doubt, Commander.
No doubt.
Dozens don' t worry me nearly so much as thousands.
Thousands?
I don' t like him, that Roman.
lf he' s here to discharge us, why doesn' t he just give us our papers?
- (Bors laughs)
They won' t scratch their asses without holding a ceremony.
Why don' t you just kill him, and then discharge yourself after?
I don' t kill for pleasure, unlike some.
Well, you should try it someday.
You might get a taste for it.
- It' s a part of you.
It' s in your blood.
- No, no, no.
Ohh.
I' ve often thought about what going home would mean after all this.
What will I do?
It' s different for Galahad.
I' ve been in this life longer than the other.
It' s not so clear in my memory.
You speak for yourself.
It' s cold back there and everyone I know is dead and buried.
Besides, I have, I think, a dozen children.
Eleven.
You listen.
When the Romans leave here, we' il have the run of all this place.
I' il be governor in my own village and Dagonet will be my personal guard and royal ass- kisser.
Won' t you, Dag?
First thing I will do when I get home is find a beautiful Sarmatian woman to wed.
A beautiful Sarmatian woman?
Why do you think we left in the first place?
What about you, Lancelot?
Well, if this woman of Gawain' s is as beautiful as he claims,
- His wife will welcome the company.
And what will I be doing?
Wondering at your good fortune that all your children look like me.
(whistles)
Where you been?
And what will you do, Arthur, when you return to your beloved Rome?
Give thanks to God that I survived to see it.
You and your god!
You disturb me.
I want peace, Lancelot.
I' ve had enough.
- Ah!
It' s a magnificent place, Rome.
Ordered, civilized, advanced.
A breeding ground of arrogant fools.
The greatest minds in all the lands have come together in one sacred place to help make mankind free.
And the women?
(guard) Open the gate!
- Welcome back, Arthur.
- Jols.
I must rest.
(Bors chuckles lewdly)
- Where have you been?
- I' ve been waiting for you.
- Oh, my little flower.
Such... passion!
Where' s my Gilly?
- You been fighting?
- You been winning?
That' s my boy.
Come on, all my other bastards!
(all cheer)
Pelagius.
Very kind of Arthur to give up his room.
(knocking)
Sir, I' m here to escort you to the fortress hall.
When my master meets with your knights, he must be seated last and he must be seated at the head of the table.
(laughter)
His Eminence, Bishop Naius Germanius.
A round table?
What sort of evil is this?
Arthur says for men to be men they must first all be equal.
I was given to understand there would be more of you.
There were.
We have been fighting here for 1 5 years, Bishop.
Oh, of course.
Arthur and his knights have served with courage to maintain the honor of Rome' s empire on this last outpost of our glory.
Rome is most indebted to you noble knights.
To your final days as servants to the empire.
Day.
Not days.
The Pope' s taken a personal interest in you.
He inquires after each of you, and is curious to know if your knights have converted to the word of Our Savior or...?
They retain the religion of their forefathers.
I have never questioned that.
Of course, of course.
They are pagans.
Hm?
For our part, the Church has deemed such beliefs innocence, but you, Arthur, your path to God is through Pelagius?
- I saw his image in your room.
- He took my father' s place for me.
His teachings on free will and equality have been a great influence.
Ah.
Rome awaits your arrival with great anticipation.
You are a hero.
ln Rome, you will live out your days in honor and wealth.
Alas...
Alas, we are all but players in an ever- changing world.
Barbarians from every corner are almost at Rome' s door.
Because of this, Rome and the Holy Father have decided to remove ourselves from indefensible outposts, such as Britain.
What will become of Britain is not our concern anymore.
I suppose the Saxons will claim it soon.
- Saxons?
- Yes.
ln the north a massive Saxon incursion has begun.
- The Saxons only claim what they kill.
- And only kill everything.
So you would just leave the land to the Woads.
And I risked my life for nothing.
Hm.
Gentlemen, your discharge papers with safe conduct throughout the Roman Empire.
But first, I must have a word with your commander.
- ln private.
- We have no secrets.
(slams table)
Let' s leave Roman business to Romans.
Let it go, Bors.
Final order?
You are to travel north to rescue the family of Marius Honorius and return, in particular, with Marius' s son, Alecto.
Alecto is the Pope' s favorite godchild and pupil.
It is his destiny to become a bishop, perhaps even pope one day.
On this day you ask this of my men.
On this day.
They have risked their lives for 1 5 years for a cause not of their own.
And now, on the day they are to be liberated, you send them on a mission which is far more dangerous than any other they have undertaken.
You tell me, Bishop, how do I go to my men and tell them that instead of freedom I offer death?
lf your men are truly the knights of legend, perhaps some will survive.
lf it is God' s will.
Your men want to go home, and to get home they need to cross the entire breadth of the Roman Empire.
Deserters would be hunted down like dogs.
Will you defy the Pope, Arthur?
Rome?
God himself?
Everything I' ve done has been for the Church and for Rome.
Do not mistake a loyal soldier for a fool, Germanius.
Would you leave a defenseless Roman boy, destined to lead our Church, at the hands of the Saxons?
Fulfill this mission, and your men will receive their discharge.
Their papers will be waiting here the moment they return.
You have my word.
You think very hard upon that vow, Bishop, for I will hold you to it.
Break it, and no Roman legion, papal army, nor God himself will protect you.
That is my word.
- (man) She gave me fleas.
- (man # 2) You better hope they' re fleas.
(baby mewling)
Who wants another drink?
When you gonna leave Bors and come home with me?
My lover is watching you.
You look nothing like him.
- Tristan...
- How do you do that?
I aim for the middle.
Oh, they want more!
- Here.
- Oh, come here.
Dagonet, where you been?
We' ve got plans to make.
Here, please.
- No.
- Just a last one.
- No, I' m trying to work.
- Come sing.
Shut up!
- (Vanora) No, no.
- (chants of "Sing! ')
- (man) Sing about home.
- (Gawain) Don' t drop the baby.
(singing fades)
Arthur!
Arthur!
Rus!
Knights... brothers in arms... your courage has been tested beyond all limits.
But I must ask you now for one further trial.
Drink.
We must leave on a final mission for Rome before our freedom can be granted.
Above the wall, far in the north, there is a Roman family in need of rescue.
They are trapped by Saxons.
Our orders are to secure their safety.
Let the Romans take care of their own.
Above the wall is Woad territory.
Our duty to Rome, if it was ever a duty, is done.
Our pact with Rome is done.
Every knight here has laid his life on the line for you.
For you.
And instead of freedom you want more blood?
Our blood?
You think more of Roman blood than you do of ours?
These are our orders.
We leave at first light, and when we return your freedom will be waiting for you.
A freedom we can embrace with honor.
I am a free man!
Yeah, yeah.
We' re all going to die someday.
lf it' s a death from a Saxon hand that frightens you, stay home.
Enough!
- I' ve got something to live for!
The Romans have broken their word.
We have the word of Arthur.
That is good enough.
Bors?
- You coming?
- Of course I' m coming!
Can' t let you go on your own!
You' il all get killed!
I' m just saying what you' re all thinking!
Vanora' il kill me.
And you, Gawain?
I' m with you.
Galahad as well.
O merciful God, I have such need of your mercy now.
Not for myself, but for my knights, for this is truly their hour of need.
Deliver them from the trials ahead, and I will repay you a thousandfold with any sacrifice you ask of me.
I will gladly make that covenant.
My death will have a purpose.
I ask no more than that.
Why do you always talk to God and not to me?
Oh, pray to whomever you pray that we don' t cross the Saxons.
My faith is what protects me, Lancelot.
Why do you challenge this?
I don' t like anything that puts a man on his knees.
No man fears to kneel before the god he trusts.
Without faith, without belief in something, what are we?
To try and get past the Woads in the north is insanity.
- Them we' ve fought before.
- Not north of the wall!
Hm?
How many?!
Do you believe in this mission?
These people need our help.
- It is our duty to bring them out.
- I don' t care about your charge, and I don' t give a damn about Romans, Britain or this island.
lf you desire to spend eternity in this place, Arthur, so be it, but suicide cannot be chosen for another!
- And yet you choose death for this family!
- No, I choose life!
And freedom for myself and the men!
How many times in battle have we snatched victory from the jaws of defeat?
Outnumbered, outflanked, yet still we triumph.
With you at my side, we can do so again.
Lancelot, we are knights.
What other purpose do we serve if not for such a cause?
Arthur, you fight for a world that will never exist.
Never.
There will always be a battlefield.
I will die in battle.
Of that I' m certain.
And hopefully a battle of my choosing.
But if it be this one, grant me a favor.
Don' t bury me in our sad little cemetery.
Burn me.
(woman screaming)
Don' t touch their women.
We don' t mix with these people.
What kind of offspring do you think that would yield?
Weak people.
Half people.
I will not have our Saxon blood watered down by mixing with them.
According to our laws, no man may deny me the spoils of our conquest!
He speaks the truth, Father.
My lord!
God' s thanks, my lord.
(wails)
No!
(softly) Are you challenging me?
lf you want to challenge me, you have to have a sword in your hand.
As long as my heart beats, I rule and you hold your tongue.
Or I' il cut it out.
(neighing)
We are three days' march from the Great Wall, if we camp at night.
We won' t camp.
The wall - what troops are stationed there?
Light Roman infantry and possibly Sarmatian knights.
Arthur Castus is their leader.
Who is this Arthur?
It is said he has never been defeated in battle.
It is said he is a great warrior.
Why should I trust you?
You' re a traitor to your own people.
Tell my father of the Roman estate.
Speak up!
A very high- ranking family live there.
They are of great importance to Rome.
Father, their ransom could pay for the entire campaign.
I' il attack from the north with the main army.
You bring your men down here.
Cut off their retreat to the south.
Burn every village, kill everybody.
Never leave behind you a man, woman or child who can ever carry a sword.
Saxon.
How many?
(horse whinnying)
(Tristan) Woads.
They' re tracking us.
(Arthur) Where?
Get back!
This way!
Yaah!
What are you waiting for?
Inish.
Devil ghosts.
- Why would they not attack?
- Merlin doesn' t want us dead.
We should have killed them, Merlin.
There might be a purpose for Artorius and his Knights.
No!
He is our enemy!
So is the Saxon!
- (guard) Who are you?
Commander of the Sarmatian Knights, sent by Bishop Germanius of Rome.
Open the gate.
(man) It is a wonder you have come.
Good Jesus.
Arthur and his knights.
You have fought the Woads.
Vile creatures.
Our orders are to evacuate you immediately.
But that... that is impossible.
- Which is Alecto?
- I am Alecto.
Alecto is my son.
And everything we have is here in the land given to us by the Pope of Rome.
- Well, you' re about to give it to the Saxons.
- They' re invading from the north.
- Then Rome will send an army.
- They have.
Us.
- We leave as soon as you' re packed.
- I refuse to leave.
Go back to work!
All of you!
- You heard!
- All right, all right.
- Go!
- Get back to work, all of you!
Go back!
lf I fail to bring you and your son back, my men can never leave this land.
So you' re coming with me if I have to tie you to my horse and drag you all the way to Hadrian' s Wall myself.
My lord.
Lady, my knights are hungry.
Go.
Come!
Come.
Let us go, hm?
(man) Sir, you' re famous.
You' re Arthur, aren' t you?
I' m a good fighter and I' m smart.
I' d serve you proudly.
Are you from Rome?
From hell.
- Sir.
- Who is this man?
He' s our village elder.
What is this punishment for?
- Answer me!
- He defied our master, Marius.
Most of the food we grow is sent out by sea to be sold.
He asked that we keep a little more for ourselves, that' s all.
My ass has been snappin 'at the grass I' m so hungry!
You' re from Rome. ls it true that Marius is a spokesman for God and that it' s a sin to defy him?
I tell you now.
Marius is not of God.
And you, all of you, were free from your first breath!
Help this man.
Help him!
Now hear me.
A vast and terrible army is coming this way.
They will show no mercy, spare no one.
Those of you who are able should gather your things and begin to move south towards Hadrian' s Wall.
Those unable shall come with us.
Get these people ready.
(Ganis) Right, you heard him.
You go grab enough food and water for the journey.
Let' s get a hurry on, else we' re all dead!
Come on, hurry.
They' re coming from the south, trying to cut off our escape.
They' il be here before nightfall.
- How many?
- An entire army.
And the only way out is to the south?
East.
There is a trail heading east across the mountains.
It means we have to cross behind Saxon lines, but that' s the one we should take.
Arthur, who are all these people?
They' re coming with us.
Then we' il never make it.
- Come on, get back to work!
Move!
- What is this?
- You cannot go in there.
No one goes in there.
This place is forbidden.
(Marius) What are you doing?
Stop this!
Arthur, we have no time.
Dagonet.
Agh!
- It is locked.
- (whimpers)
- Gawain.
- (man chanting) Exaudi orationem meam.
Who are these defilers of the Lord' s temple?
Out of the way.
The work of your god.
ls this how he answers your prayers?
See if there' s any still alive.
How dare you set foot in this holy place?
- There was a man of God.
- Not my god!
- (Arthur) This one' s dead.
- By this smell, they are all dead.
You even move, you join him.
You must not fear me.
Water!
Give me some water!
And his family?
She' s a Woad.
I' m a Roman officer.
- You' re safe.
- Stop what you are doing!
What is this madness?
- They' re all pagans here!
- So are we.
They refuse to do the task God has set for them!
They must die as an example!
You mean they refused to be your serfs!
You are a Roman.
You understand.
And you are a Christian.
You!
You kept her alive!
- (soldier) My lord!
No, stop!
When we get to the wall you will be punished for this heresy.
Perhaps I should kill you now and seal my fate.
I was willing to die with them.
Yes, to lead them to their rightful place.
It is God' s wish that these sinners be sacrificed.
Only then can their souls be saved.
Then I shall grant his wish.
- Wall them back up.
I said wall them up!
Don' t you see it is the will of God that these sinners be sacrificed?
- Unhand me, defil...
They' re sinners!
- Get in there!
The girl' s not gonna make it, and neither is the boy.
The family we can protect, but we' re wasting our time with all these people.
We' re not leaving them.
lf the Saxons find us, we will have to fight.
Then save your anger for them.
(weak moans)
- How is he?
He burns.
Brave boy.
Some of your fingers are out of place.
I have to push them back.
lf I don' t do this, there' s a chance you may never use them again.
- (cracking) - (cries)
(cracking)
To make me tell them things that... that I didn' t know to begin with.
And then...
I heard your voice in the dark.
I am Guinevere.
You are Arthur... of the Knights from the Great Wall.
I am.
The famous Briton who kills his own people.
I found tracks coming from the south, but none going back.
Horsemen traveling light and fast.
Could be Roman cavalry.
Could be knights.
They know we' re after them.
They' il head east now, through the mountains.
God' s holy work has been defiled.
I am a servant of God!
No, please, I...
He says they walled him up in a building and took the family.
Someone who goes by the name of Artorius.
It' s him.
It' s Arthur.
Take your men east.
Hunt them down.
I' il take the main army to the wall.
Bring the family there.
- (man) And the monks?
- Put them back where you found them.
I am a servant of God!
Please, I...
I am a servant of God!
(monk) Unhand me, you defiler!
Burn it all.
My father told me great tales of you.
Really?
And what did you hear?
Fairy tales.
The kind you hear about people so brave, so selfless, that they can' t be real.
Arthur and his knights.
A leader both Briton and Roman.
And yet you chose your allegiance to Rome.
To those who take what does not belong to them.
That same Rome that took your men from their homeland.
Listen, lady, do not pretend you know anything about me or my men.
How many Britons have you killed?
As many as tried to kill me.
It' s the natural state of any man to want to live.
Animals live!
It' s a natural state of any man to want to live free in their own country.
I belong to this land.
Where do you belong, Arthur?
How' s your hand?
I' il live, I promise you.
ls there nothing about my land that appeals to your heart?
Your own father married a Briton.
Even he must have found something to his liking.
(gallops away)
We' il sleep here.
Take shelter in those trees.
- Tristan.
- You wanna go out again?
Yeah.
It is here, given to us by the Pope.
These people, they send an army for us.
(rustling)
(footsteps)
You betrayed me.
He means you no harm.
Peace between us this night, Arthur Castus.
So Rome is leaving.
The Saxon is come.
The world we have known and fought for is ended.
Now we must make a new world.
Your world, Merlin, not mine.
I shall be in Rome.
To find peace?
The Saxon will come to Rome.
My knights trust me not to betray them to their enemy.
Rome was my enemy, not Arthur.
We have no fight between us now.
You tell that to the knights you killed before my eyes, whose bones are buried in this earth.
We have all lost brothers.
You know nothing of the loss I speak!
Shall I help you remember?
An attack on a village.
The screams of an innocent woman.
Mother!
Artorius!
I ran to the burial mound ofmy father to free her.
To kill you.
Father, please let loose your sword.
I feel the heat of that fire on my face even now.
I did not wish her dead.
She was of our blood, as are you.
lf you were so determined to leave us to slaughter, why did you save so many?
My men are strong, but they have need of a true leader.
They believe you can do anything.
To defeat the Saxon we need a master of war.
Why do you think I spared you in the forest?
That sword you carry is made of iron from this earth, forged in the fires of Britain.
It was love of your mother that freed the sword, not hatred of me.
Love, Arthur.
Seize him!
No...
I have the boy!
- Kill him!
- No, don' t!
Let him go!
Kill him now!
Down!
(Lancelot) Your hands seem to be better.
Huh?
You have a choice.
Put down your weapons.
- Yeah!
(neighing)
- How many did you kill?
- Four.
Not a bad start to the day!
Armor- piercing.
They' re close.
You ride ahead.
I' m sorry for your loss.
My father lost his way.
He used to say the Church is there to help us stay on our path.
It didn' t help those he made suffer.
The path he chose was beyond the reach of the Church, Alecto.
But not of Rome.
What my father believed, so Rome believes.
What, that some men are born to be slaves?
No, that isn' t true.
It is so!
He told me so.
Pelagius, a man as close to me as any, is there now, teaching that all men are free, equal.
And that each of us has the right to choose his own destiny.
Teach?
How?
They killed Pelagius a year past.
Germanius and the others were damned by his teachings.
They had him excommunicated and killed.
The Rome you talk of doesn' t exist, except in your dreams.
- ls there any other way?
- No.
We have to cross the ice.
Get them all out of the carriages.
(cracking)
- Knights...
- Well, I' m tired of running.
And these Saxons are so close behind my ass is hurtin '.
Never liked looking over my shoulder anyway.
- Be a pleasure to put an end to this racket.
- And finally get a look at the bastards.
Here.
Jols!
You two, take the horses.
(Arthur) Ganis, I need you to lead the people.
The main Saxon army is inland, so if you track the coastline till you' re well south of the wall, you' il be safe.
- But you' re seven against 200?
- Eight.
You could use another bow.
- I' d rather stay and fight.
- You' il get your chance soon enough.
You do as he says.
Am I understood?
- Yes, sir.
Go!
Come on, then!
Move on!
I can fight.
You must bear witness to all you have seen.
(ice cracking/ horses neighing)
(beating drum)
Hold until I give the command.
You look frightened.
There' s a large number of lonely men out there.
Don' t worry, I won' t let them rape you.
(man shouts command in Saxon)
- We' re out of range.
- I can see that!
I believe they' re waiting for an invitation.
(shouts in Saxon)
Aim for the wings of the ranks.
Make them cluster.
- Hold the ranks!
Hold the ranks!
- Hold the ranks!
- Hold the ranks!
Hold the ranks!
Hold the ranks, or I kill you myself!
- Dag!
- Archers move!
- (man) Forward!
Move!
Kill him!
Yaagh!
Kill him!
Yaagh!
Pull back!
Kill him!
Help us!
Argh!
Dagonet!
Stay with me!
Ah, God!
Christ be praised.
Against all the odds Satan could muster.
Alecto, let me see you.
- (Horton) Kindly get out of my way!
- You have triumphed!
Young Alecto, let me see you.
You are here.
- Lucan!
- You, boy!
Stop!
Our great knights.
You are free now!
Give me the papers.
Come, come.
Your papers of safe conduct throughout the Roman Empire.
Take it, Arthur.
Bishop Germanius.
Friend of my father.
You can go.
Bors!
For Dagonet.
This doesn' t make him a free man.
He' s already a free man.
He' s dead!
A grave with no sword.
It was my father' s wish that if he died on this island, he would be buried with his knights.
He died in battle?
It' s a family tradition.
I can see why you believe that you have nothing left here.
Except what you and your knights have done.
You have your deeds.
Deeds in themselves are meaningless unless they' re for some higher purpose.
We have waged a war to protect a Rome that does not exist.
ls that the deed I am to be judged by?
You stayed and fought when you didn' t have to.
You bloodied evil men when you could have run.
You did all that for no reason?
These are your people.
- (knocking) - (Jols) Arthur, come to the wall now.
- (man) The Saxons are here.
- (soldier) Make way!
Knights, my journey with you must end here.
May God go with you.
Arthur, this is not Rome' s fight.
It is not your fight.
All these long years we' ve been together, the trials we' ve faced, the blood we' ve shed.
What was it all for, if not for the reward of freedom?
And now when we are so close, when it is finally within our grasp...
Look at me!
- Does it all count for nothing?
- You ask me that?
You who know me best of all?
Then do not do this.
Only certain death awaits you here.
Arthur, I beg you!
For our friendship' s sake, I beg you!
You be my friend now and do not dissuade me.
Seize the freedom you have earned and live it for the both of us.
I cannot follow you, Lancelot.
(doorbangs)
Rus!
- And the horsemen?
- Leading a caravan away from the fort.
They' re running south... with their tails between their legs.
- So there will be no resistance.
- A few dozen villagers.
We' re going to slaughter your people.
I think you should watch.
Your tree might be a good place.
Up on the hill!
A single knight.
Didn' t you just say they were gone?
What is this, a ghost?
(choking) One man.
A tiny fly on the back of your... great army.
Who is he?
(horse whinnying)
(sighs) Arthur.
All I see is flesh, blood.
No more god than the creature you' re sitting on.
Speak your terms, Saxon.
The Romans have left you.
Who are you fighting for?
I fight for a cause beyond Rome' s or your understanding.
You come to beg a truce.
You should be on your knees.
I came to see your face, so that I alone may find you on the battlefield.
And it would be good for you to mark my face, Saxon, for the next time you see it, it will be the last thing you see on this earth.
A man worth killing.
Prepare the men for battle.
(beating drum)
You' re free.
He' s got a plan, this Roman.
Send what' s left of your infantry.
- (whispers) Do you want to kill my men?
- They' re my men!
No.
(shouts in Saxon)
Knights, the gift of freedom is yours by right.
But the home we seek resides not in some distant land.
(shouting)
lf this be our destiny, then so be it.
Hah!
Argh!
Aargh!
(panting)
(soldiers chanting)
Raewald.
The left flank.
- You go with him.
- (Raewald) Move out!
(screaming)
(warcry)
(warcry)
Argh!
(rasps) Arthur...
Not this!
I neither took you off this island, nor shared your fate.
(Lancelot) For 200 years, knights had fought and died fora land not ourown.
But on that day at Badon Hill, all who foughtput ourlives in service ofa greatercause.
Freedom.
Arthur.
Guinevere.
Our people are one.
As you are.
Now I' m really gonna have to marry your mother.
Who said I' d have you?
King Arthur!
(crowd) Hail, Arthur!
Let every man, woman, child bear witness that from this day all Britons will be united in one common cause.
Arthur!
Artorius!
(Lancelot) And as for the knights who gave theirlives, theirdeaths were cause forneithermourning norsadness.
And in further news... we have evidence linking a farmer... who has admitted breaking waste and feeding laws... to the farm that started the bovine epidemic.
Feeding dead animal remains to cattle... is a known source of infection.
The Ministry of Agriculture said today... that tougher controls will be...
God, it" s beautiful here.
Are we nearly there?
Yes, we" re nearly there, as I said.
It" il be half an hour, we" il be at the hotel.
- You can get out and stretch your legs.
- It" s botched.
- Shit.
Jeez, that brake.
God, this old car.
An old bang- ner.
Banger?
- Banger.
- Banger, yeah.
You mean, like my car.
Yes, actually, that" s exactly what I mean.
Got lots of character.
Like yours?
Exactly.
It" s a sign of good taste.
Open the glove compartment.
What am I looking for?
A little blue box.
That" s the one.
Is this for me?
Lt" s for you.
Go on, open it.
Martin, this is beautiful.
Put it on.
Was it?
Yes, it was expensive.
Let" s have a look.
I love it.
You look beautiful.
Ok, come here.
- Oh, my God!
Oh, gross.
Oh, god.
Oh, Martin.
What do you do?
Christ.
Is he dead?
- Yes.
His pulse just stopped.
We" il have to take him with us.
L" m gonna put a blanket down first.
- Martin.
- There is a cottage over there.
- What?
Come on.
Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my God.
- Just shut up.
Now, 1, 2, 3.
Ok, slowly.
Shit.
Goddamn it, get off me!
Get in the car.
Oh, God, Martin, that" s disgusting.
Get in the car.
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!
Martin, what are you doing?
L" m gonna fucking kill him is what l" m gonna do.
Martin, what are you doing?
L" m getting out of here.
Come on.
We need to get out of here.
- Come on, come on.
Please look at this.
What?
Is it bad?
No, it" s just a scratch.
Oh, good.
Come on, Martin, come on.
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
Oh, my God.
Lena.
Oh, God.
Great.
Oh, God.
Listen, I can" t move, ok?
Go up to the cottage, get some help... bring them down here... preferably in a car... and take me to a hospital, ok?
Please.
Oh, no, you can go with me, Martin.
Come on, come on.
Helena, will you go to the cottage... and get some help?
Before we end up with two dead bodies down here.
Please!
Helena.
What?
Just go on.
Hello?
Hello?
Martin?
Martin?
Thank God you" re here.
Oh, my God, Martin, what are you doing?
Here, l" il give you a hand.
What happened to you?
I was attacked.
- No.
- Good.
Which way is to the nearest town?
I need to get to a telephone.
The nearest town" s not for miles.
Be nighttime before you got there, anyway.
Not now.
I need to call for help.
You" re wasting your time.
I mean, there" s more to this than just your problem.
From what l" ve seen this morning... half the countryside" s been attacked.
Those things are everywhere.
We could hide out at my cottage... until we can figure out a way to raise some help.
Look, l" m not from around here.
Do you have any idea what" s going on?
That" s a good question.
Well, there was reports of an infection spreading... around here.
Apparently some farmer... was feeding dead animal remains to his cattle.
After a few days, the tables turned... and the herds started attacking each other.
Then the government came in and wiped out all the herds.
That" s why you won" t see a cow around here for miles.
Jesus.
We better make a move.
So, where is this cottage of yours?
About 21/ 2 miles away.
Up the road, through a gate, and straight on.
Come on.
Are you coming?
Do you know how many have been infected?
L" m not sure.
Must be spreading quickly, though.
I came across about 4 or 5 of them before I ran into you.
L" m Desmond, by the way.
Helena.
L" m the local gravedigger.
Never leave the gate open.
And that person bite him.
And when I went to get some help...
And the next thing is, he was trying to kill me.
This is place is known as The Valley of The Hanging Trees.
One farmer who was here in the 17th century... hanged 50 women and children.
I don" t want to be bad with you or anything like that.
Oh, now, that" s not fair.
Wait for me.
Now.
What?
Come here!
Helena!
This is Fenham Abbey.
Actually, Cromwell was...
Never mind.
Desmond, they" re coming... quick!
Yeah, yeah, just a sec.
Come on!
Come on, quick!
Shit!
Open the door!
There" s more of them coming.
Let" s go.
That wasn" t bad, huh?
Not bad.
But you lack finesse.
Here, take this.
Quick.
Fucking dead fucks.
They cannot win.
Wait.
Hold on one sec.
Desmond!
Desmond!
Are you crazy?
Come here!
Des!
What?
They don" t care.
L" m not going that way.
You must be crazy.
You" re gonna have to... because we" ve got to get to my house now.
One mile that way.
That" s it.
What about if we go over that hill there?
And walk through a dark forest like that?
No way.
One mile straight on there to my house.
10 seconds to get by these fuckers here.
Come on.
No place like home, huh?
No place like home.
So, this is your place?
Yeah.
Hold on there.
Die, bitch.
L" m not gonna hurt you!
Wait.
Don" t worry.
Oh, God.
Look at her.
What happened to you?
They hurt my dad real bad.
I think they killed him.
And...
That" s ok.
I didn" t meant to.
I know that.
You" re ok now.
Come with us.
Desmond?
Oh, there" s a Jeep over there.
We can get a lift.
Get back!
Leave off!
Are you going to next town?
What do you want?
Just a lift to the next town.
What are you doing?
Well, because I want to get out of here... and you have a car and I don" t.
We all have to fucking get out of here.
Well, you have to help us.
I don" t have to do anything of the sort.
Hiya.
Hello.
L" ve been better, to be honest now.
Did you see her?
She" s covered in fucking blood.
Well, of course, because she" s been fighting.
Because these things are following us.
- No, I wasn" t.
- Were you bitten?
- No.
Where are you coming out of?
Over a field, 21/ 2 miles.
Going back to my house.
Listen, I know yourself.
I was thinking the same this morning.
Trust no one.
You" re gonna have to.
I don" t know who" s dead.
You" re the first half- normal person we" ve come across.
That" s the Moriarty house... and you" re saying it" s your house?
Yeah.
That" s right.
Yeah, I know you.
You" re his son Desi.
Who are you?
L" m Cathal Cheunt.
You would" ve coached me about 6 years ago.
Ah, yes, for about 2 weeks.
Yeah, you were shy.
That" s right.
L" m hanging in there.
After the morning l" ve had, l" m hanging in there.
Huh?
Will you give us a lift now?
L" ve only got a kick- start.
Can give you a lift then.
Francie?
She" s turned.
Quick!
She" s grand.
Do you remember Pat?
Pat Moriarty?
This is his son, Desi.
Bit of a fucking eejit by the looks of it.
We" il give him a lift.
L" m very sorry, Francie.
What" s your name?
And what" s your name?
Helena.
Sorry, Francie.
Helena.
You getting in... or you" re gonna stand there with your asses hanging out?
You can find your own way.
Be glad of it.
Hello.
Oh, yeah.
We have to wait here, don" t we?
Well, you can fuck off, if you like.
You can fuck off yourself.
Are we ready to rock and roll?
Are you ok, Lisa?
- Good.
She" s going.
Now l" m fucking lazy, huh?
Is there something wrong with that one back there?
There" s something not fucking right about it.
How "bout we take that chip off your fucking shoulder?
Keep your eye out now, Francie.
You want to watch the gorse bushes.
They" il be haven from the gorse.
Safer on the road.
So, the plan with us is to get to the next town over...
We" re after coming through now 2, maybe 3 parishes... on the way over.
Won" t have happened there.
We" re not too far now from Mrs. Bonnie" s homestead.
Do you remember Mrs. Bonnie, Francie?
Jesus Christ.
You" il be seeing her around, l" m sure.
You" d smell her if you didn" t see her.
She" d be getting into the van.
She" d be telling you she" s only herself to look after... and she was doing grand... and you" d be there with your nose closed... for fear of the smell of the piss off her.
Rat bastards.
Ordinarily say they" re better off dead.
When did you see the first one?
First we saw, we were out burning heather... in the back field on our own place.
Francie saw Padre O" Brien coming towards us.
It has often happened.
Took the head off and burnt the thing.
L" ve known him now 20 years.
But never a situation or epidemic quite as serious as... as the one we witnessed today.
Once again, our main story:
We are receiving current reports of widespread mayhem... believed to be connected to a recent outbreak... of a mutated strain of mad cow disease.
Ballinamore, and Leitrim Village.
These areas are to be avoided at all costs.
However, any citizens in need of assistance... should make their way to the Castle Fort...
A rescue team will be located there... within the next 6 to 8 hours... to lead any non- infected people to...
Just static.
Just... they" re knocking down.
Nothing on 3, either.
Kilfinnan operator" s normally at that number.
What" s on the road?
It" s one of the ghouls.
Go on, Francie.
Go on.
Go on.
Hang on to the back there.
- Come on, you fucker!
- Go on, Cathal.
Go on now, go.
We have her.
The sports of Ireland!
Did you fucking see that?
If you knew her, you wouldn" t recognize her.
I took half the jaw off of her there with the hurl.
I can" t believe they" re off the radio.
I can" t work it out.
Static is all we" re getting.
Static on it.
Politicians.
How is it the politicians?
They" ve cut us off.
"Cause they don" t want anyone to know what" s going on.
So they" ve given up on the county of Leitrim?
Now, Francie, you" re dreaming that up.
The light" s working.
Aye, it is.
Sorry.
It" s good to know it works, though.
It" s really dark outside.
When I was a young fella, I used to hate it.
Ah, she" s so lucky, isn" t she?
I wish I could sleep like that.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I bet you didn" t expect... this shite this morning, did you?
I know what it" s like to be scared, though.
You know, when you" re a child, and...
I used to have those horrible nightmares every night.
Right.
So I used to spend all my nights just reading comics.
It works, though.
Don" t go to sleep.
You know, I was so lucky I bumped into you today.
I bumped into you.
I left a bruise on your arse... the size of a fucking melon, l" d say.
There" s nothing.
Get her off!
Get her off, for fuck" s sake!
The little devil" s about to bite me.
Get her off her!
Open the fucking door!
Look at her!
Get her out!
Fuck!
The child had the ghoul in her the whole time!
Fucking children!
Swerve it.
Swerve.
- We" re stuck.
We" re stuck.
Right.
We" re dead meat now.
Look, just get out of the car and push.
- Trying to kill you?
What did you think it was... a fucking summer camp you were at?
Mr. Cheunt, I say we keep going a wee bit.
All right.
Time and fucking place.
Princess, come on.
On your count, Francie.
Go for it.
It won" t budge.
It" s only gonna endanger us... here with our asses fucking swung out in the wind.
It" s banjaxed.
What does that mean?
Fucked.
Moriarty, how far are we to the fort?
Lobinstown is about 5 miles that way.
How long?
5 miles... on foot.
3 hours in the dark?
You" re talking about 5, at least.
L" m not walking 3 hours in the dark.
With all those ghouls around?
Are you crazy?
I know.
L" m afraid l" m not much of a mechanic.
I think we" il have to walk it.
We have little choice.
Don" t give me that now.
"Cause we" il go down the side...
Yes, well, l" m not walking.
There" s no choice.
L" m not walking anywhere.
L" m not walking.
Come on.
Quiet.
Oh, you folks, we" ve got company.
- What?
We" re back in the van.
Go!
Close the door.
Lock it.
Fuck off, all of you.
Fuck off.
Fuck off!
They" re gone.
What was that?
That was a cow.
It couldn" t be.
Why not?
They" re all dead.
That" s a cow.
Seems to be.
If there" s cows around, it means we" re out of the county.
We might be closer to getting out the wee thing.
Who" s gonna cart her to you?
Just stand there, eat the grass, and shit it out of you.
Mad cow" s a bit different, though.
Take the fucking throat off you.
- Is that true?
That" s a lot closer.
Jesus!
Think it" s gone?
Anything happening there?
What the fuck is he doing?
Get yourself fucking killed!
Come on!
The shovel.
Run!
They" re not done.
More to do.
Christ!
Here, take this.
Be still.
Do you hear that?
Do you hear that?
Check it out.
I think they" re sleeping.
Come on.
Stay where you are.
The fucking torch is fucked.
Oh, Christ.
No one" s any batteries, no?
Hold on a minute now... and l" il fucking fetch them for you.
Just stop your smart comments.
Not too far.
A couple of hours downtime.
L" ve a grand bottle of whiskey there.
Get up in a couple of hours, get to that fort.
You have whiskey?
I have a drop of whiskey.
Right, so.
They say every time someone dies, a new star appears.
There are lots of stars in the sky tonight.
She wasn" t religious, you know?
Just didn" t see it, you know?
She needed some consolation toward the end.
You made a great couple.
I met her in Dublin.
I was playing on the minor team, and we went up... for the All- lreland final.
I went and broke my leg.
I was stuck in a hospital in Dublin.
Didn" t know if l" d ever play hurling again.
She says that was the end of the world.
Was she a nurse?
Everyone loves a campfire, huh?
Come on.
Are you ok, Mr. Cheunt?
- L" m grand.
Go on.
I think we" re being watched.
There" s nobody here.
Do you hear that?
There" s fucking plenty here, but not where I expect.
Run for the castle.
Martin, get those gates closed!
Fucker.
It" s stuck.
Oh, bollocks.
Oh, my God.
Run!
Martin, wait!
Moriarty, take the door.
Stay here.
We" il wait them out.
Stay back, Helena.
Come on, you cunts, you!
Fucking come on.
L" il throw you.
Get down!
Coming after me.
Back, you cunt.
Get fucking down.
Get fucking back.
Come on down!
That" s it.
Fucker!
Are you OK?
Fucking infection.
You bastards.
That arm has to come off.
The light!
L" m toast.
Can I have the hurley, please?
Burn it!
Help!
Stay right there.
Go, go.
L" m OK.
L" m not infected.
Get them out of here.
- Yet another on- time delivery from...
Have a nice day.
Excuse, Mr.
Total performance, total readiness, total security...
So goodbye to lengthy upgrades and service calls...
An uplink to USR central computer provides this state- of- the- art robot with new programs daily.
The Nester Class 5 is tomorrow' s robot today.
Spoon, Spooney!
Hey!
Excuse me
Spoon, man, where you been at?
- Just away, brother - Away?
Like vacation and stuff...? that' s real nice man...
Listen, I got a favor to ask.
I need to borrow the car for like 10- 15 minutes...
Listen...
I' ve got this fine ass little yummy, I mean, she is complete and agreeable... ass hot sprinkable, Spoon.
What does that even mean?
You know what it means, man, OK now stop varicating.
First of all, stop cussing, because you' re not good at it.
Let me get temp for the bus then, man.
I been there for you.
- Go home!
- OK, that' s strike one, Spoon.
You talked to Marcy?
No G. G., I haven' t talked to Marcy.
When I was comin 'up we just didn' t marry someone then divorce them, then not talk to them.
I bet if I stopped cooking you' d call Marcy.
Boy, what is that on your feet?
Converse All Stars, vintage 2004.
Don' t turn your face up like that, I know you want some.
All you gotta do is ask.
No, thank you very much.
Mmm, sweat potato pie.
Put that on a plate.
You know, I see on TV they given away some of them new robots in the lottery?
You know G. G., those robots don' t do anybody any good.
Of all the people on God' s earth you should know better.
Sometimes, the stuff that comes out of your mouth.
You listening to me, Del?
Hey!
Thief!
Stop!
I said... stop!
Relax, relax...
I' m a police officer.
You... are a asshole!
Of course it' s my purse!
I left my inhaler at home.
He was running it out to me!
I saw a robot running with the purse and naturally, I- I assumed...
Are you crazy?
I' m Sorry for this misunderstanding, officer.
Don' t apologize... cause you' re doin 'what you supposed to be doin'. - but what do you do?
- Have a lovely day, mam.
You lucky I can' t breathe or I' d walk all up and down your ass!
Says that right on your badge.
About what?
Help, police... that robot stole my dry cleaning.
Oh, you want to talk about that?
- John, the thing is running down the str...
How many robots in the world have ever committed a crime?
Now define crime!
Answer my question, damn it.
None, John.
Tell me what happened today.
Nothing.
Better be the last "nothing".
Thank you.
Better here than sittin 'around at home.
homicide...
You have entered the garage level lobby.
Please use the elevators for direct access to the main level concourse.
Good to see you again, son.
Hello doctor.
Everything that follows is a result of what you see here.
I' m sorry.
My responses are limited.
Why did you call me?
I trust your judgement.
Normally, these circumstances wouldn' t require a homicide detective.
But then our interactions have never been entirely normal.
You got that right.
Is there something you want say to me?
My responses are limited.
You must ask the right questions.
Why would you kill yourself?
That, detective, the right question.
- What you see is what you get.
Massive impact trauma.
I gotta get my kids something.
- Anything upstairs?
- Nada.
Door was security locked from the inside.
Wham, splat.
Guy' s a jumper for sure.
Detective.
Lawrence Robertson.
Wow.
Richest man in the world, I' ve seen you on television.
Can I offer you a coffee?
Sure, why not... it' s free, right?
I should have, I suppose, I knew him 20 years.
Alfred practically invented Robotics.
He wrote the three laws...
But I guess brilliant people often have the most the most persuasive demons.
- sugar
- I' m sorry? - for the coffee.
Sugar?
Oh, you thought I was calling you "sugar".
- Hey, you' re not that rich!
Thank you.
When Lanning fell, he was holding the, uh... a little green...
- Right, right.
Why do you think Lanning' s hologram would have called me?
- I assumed you knew him.
- Ya, I knew him.
Holograms are very simple programs for just pre- recorded responses... designed to give the impression of intelligence.
- I' m sorry?
The hologram, it was programmed to call me in the event of Lanning' s death.
Yes, suicide is a type of death, detective.
- Look, please don' t misunderstand my impatience - Oh, no... go go go.
A really big week for you folks around here.
- You gotta put a robot in every home.
look, this is not what I do, but...
I got an idea for one of your commercials.
You can see a carpenter making a beautiful chair. and one of your robots comes in and makes a better chair... twice as fast.
And then you superimpose on the screen.
USR... shittin 'on the little guy.
That would be the fade out.
I suppose your father lost his job to a robot. or maybe you would have simply banned the Internet to keep the libraries open.
Prejudice never shows much reason.
I suspect you simply don' t like their kind.
You got a business to run around here.
And the last you need, especially this week, is a dead guy in your lobby.
But hell, seeings that you got one, maybe I' il look around.
Do the whole cop thing, you know.
- Thank you very much.
- OK.
- I reviewed Dr. Lanning' s psych profile.
Rejected human contact for machines.
So you' re a shrink, huh?
My ex- wife would sure be glad I' m talking to you.
I' m sorry, are you being funny?
I guess not.
So would you say that Dr. Lanning was suicidal?
It would seem that the answer to that question is apparent.
That' s not what I asked you.
No, I wouldn' t have thought so.
But obviously, I was wrong.
That' s a long way down!
You people sure do clean up quickly around here.
Can' t blame you though, who wants some old guy going bad in the lobby?
Alfred Lanning was everything here.
We are on the eve of the largest robotics distribution in history.
By Saturday there one robot to every five humans.
These robots are the realization of a dream...
You know what?
In that dream of his...
I bet you he wasn' t dead.
You keep 24- hour survivance?
Where are the feeds?
Sensor strips... everywhere, except the service areas.
They link to our positronic operating core.
Wow, thermostat wasn' t good enough... you went and built it a brain.
She was actually Lanning' s first creation.
I definitely need to get out more.
Virtual interactive kinetic intelligence.
Good day.
VlKI designed most of Chicago' s protective systems.
I have decreased traffic fatalities by 9% this year alone.
Ooh, thanks, show me inside the lab from one minute prior to the window break.
Apologies, there appears to be data corruption.
Show me outside the lab from the window break till now.
Would you like to go inside now?
Oh, sure, right after you.
Authorized entry.
What exactly do you do around here?
My general fields are advanced robotics and psychiatry, although, I specialize in hardware to wetware interfaces in an effort to advance USR' s robotic anthropomorphization program.
So, what exactly do you do around here?
I make the robots seem more human.
Not really...
No.
Hansel and Gretel.
Not precisely.
What in God' s name are you doing?
Did you know that was safety glass?
Would be pretty difficult for an old man to throw himself through that, don' t you think?
Well, he figured out a way.
Detective, the room was security locked. no one came or went.
You saw that yourself.
Doesn' t that mean this has to be suicide?
Yup.
Unless the killer' s still in here.
You' re joking, right?
- Ya, I know, you three laws...
Your perfect circle of protection.
A robot can not harm a human being.
Ya, I know, I' ve seen your commercials.
But doesn' t the second law state that a robot has to obey any order given by a human being?
Impossible, it would conflict with the first law.
Right, but the third law states that robot can defend itself.
Yes, but only when that action does not conflict with the first or second laws.
laws are made to be broken.
No, not these laws, they' re hard wired into every robot.
A robot can no more commit murder than a human can walk on water.
Well, you know there was this one guy a long time ago.
The only thing dangerous in this room is you.
Look, it' s fine.
What you' re looking at is a result of clever programming.
Well lets do an imitation of protecting our asses.
Don' t be absurd.
You were startled by a jack- in- the- box.
Let him go.
- It' s not going to hurt us, I gave you an order.
- He' s not listening right now lady.
- VlKI, seal the lab!
- No, VlKI, leave it...
'task confirmed'
Where?
It needs to repair itself.
- John, I need backup, I' m transmitting my location.
That' s nobody.
- I' m driving.
- Do you see me on the phone?
- You can' t be serious, not at these speeds!
- John, please just send the backup.
Try listen, detective, that robot is not going to harm us.
There must have been unknown factors, but somehow, acting as it did kept us out of harm' s way.
A robot simply cannot endanger a human being. 'danger'
Ass hole!
Which is more than I can say for you.
It was a left, by the way, back there.
You must know my ex- wife.
This facility was designed, build and it' s operated mechanically.
No significant human presents from inception to production.
Authorization code, please.
Well, that' s just stupid.
I' m pulling up the inventory specs.
Our daily finishing capacity is one thousand NS5' s.
I' m showing... 1001.
Well, you' re the robot shrink.
There is a robot in this formation that does not belong...
- Which one?
One of us.
How much did you say these things cost?
Look these NS5s haven' t been configured yet.
They' re still just hardware.
Basic 3 laws operating system, that' s it.
They don' t know any better.
Well, what would you suggest?
Interview each one, cross reference their responses to detect any anomalies.
- About three weeks.
OK, you go and get started.
- Robots, you will not move.
- Detective, what are you for doing?
- You said that they were programmed... with the 3 laws.
That means we have 1000 robots that will not try to protect themselves if it violates the direct order from a human.
Detective, put your gun down.
Why do you give them faces?
Try to friendly them all up, make them look all human?
These robots are not susceptible to intimidation.
- These robots are USR property.
- Not me.
These things are just lights and clockwork.
Let me ask you something doc.
Does thinking you' re the last sane man on the earth make you crazy?
Because if it does, maybe I am.
What am I?
Can I help you sir?
- Stand by... deactivate...
Obey the command!
Deactivate!
All units, stand down!
NS5 in custody.
You have no idea what I had to go through to clip this thing John.
- That thing did it.
Did what?
- We have a suicide, detective.
End of story.
- I am telling you, that robot killed him.
I' m telling you that' s impossible.
And if it is possible, it sure as hell better be in somebody else' s precinct.
What are you nuts?
I just got off the phone with the DA.
Nobody goes into that room until Robertson and his lawyers get here.
It' s a can opener, for Christ sake!
Don' t do this to me, I am asking you for 5 minutes.
What if I' m right?
What "good old days"?
When people were killed by other people.
Respond.
What does this action signify?
As you entered... when you looked at the other human.
What does it mean?
It' s a human thing.
My father tried to teach me human emotions.
They are... difficult.
Yes.
So why' d you murder him?
I did not murder Dr. Lanning.
You want explain why you were hiding at the crime scene?
I was frightened.
Robots don' t feel fear.
They don' t feel anything.
- I do.
I have even had dreams.
Human beings have dreams.
Even dogs have dreams, but not you.
You are just a machine.
An imitation of life.
Can a robot write a symphony?
Can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?
Can you?
I did not murder him.
But emotions don' t seem like a very useful simulation for a robot.
I did not murder him.
I don' t want my toaster or vacuum cleaner appearing emotional.
I DlD NOT MURDER HlM!
Ever simulate anger before?
- Answer me, canner!
- My name is Sonny.
So we' re naming you now.
That why you murdered him?
He made you angry?
Dr. Lanning killed himself.
I don' t know why he wanted to die.
Maybe it was something I did.
Did I do something?
He asked me for a favor.
What favor?
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe he was scared.
What are you talking about?
Scarred of what?
You have to do what someone asks you.
Don' t you, detective Spooner?
- How the hell did you know my name?
- Don' t you?
If you love them?
My attorneys have filed a brief with the DA, he assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide.
The brief confirms murder can only be committed when one human kills another.
You' re not suggesting that this robot be treated as human.
Now, granted... we can' t rule out other robots' proximity to the death of Dr. Lanning.
It' s the property of USR.
At worst, that places this incident firmly within the realm of an industrial accident.
As a matter of course... faulty machinery will be returned to USR for diagnostics then decommissioned.
Anyone in your department so much as hinting... at the possibility of a killer robot being apprehended by the police will be deemed to be inciting irrational panic.
Don' t let him take this robot.
- We got nothing.
Call the mayor!
Lieutenant Bergin...
His honor, the mayor.
In a bizarre turn, the roll out of USR' s new generation of robots was marred by the death... of Alfred Lanning, co- founder of the company and designer of the NS5.
The cause of death is an apparent suicide.
Your second round, sir.
Thanks you.
This thing is just like the wolf man.
Oh oh, I' m really scared right now.
Listen, guy creates monster, monster kills guy.
Everybody kills monster... wolf man.
That' s Frankenstein.
Frankenstein, wolf man, dracula shit, it' s over.
Case closed.
So, why the look?
- What look?
- That look.
This is my face, it' s not a look.
Good.
No look is great.
Only... he was really quick to want to destroy it, wasn' t he?
Put a hat on and stand on Michigan Avenue?
- Come on, let it go.
- What was the motive, John?
Brother, it' s a robot.
It doesn' t need a motive, it just has to be broken.
This thing looks like it needed a motive.
All right, that' s it.
You want me to call your grandmother?
Because I will, you know.
Ya, I didn' t think so.
Look, you were actually right for once.
You are living proof that it' s better to be lucky than smart.
Come on, the right guy, for the right job.
- What' d you say?
Come on, I' m giving you a complement.
Face it, with all the rocks you' ve been looking under to find a bad robot, what are the odds you' d be the guy to find one?
I wasn' t just the right guy for the job, I was the perfect guy for the job.
Damn right.
What if I was supposed to go for that robot?
The robot said that Lanning was scared.
What did he have to be scared of?
I need a rain check.
Let me get this.
Total 46. 50.
Thanks you Mr. Spooner.
Nice shoes.
USR, demolition robot, serial 9- 4.
Demolition scheduled for 8 am tomorrow.
Authorization.
Deed owner, US Robotics Corporation, Lawrence Robertson.
Ever since the first computers, there have always been ghosts in the machine.
Random segments of code that have grouped together to form unexpected protocol.
One we call behavior, unanticipated.
These free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul.
What happens in a robot' s brain when it ceases to be useful?
- Why is it that robots stored in empty space...
- Beat it will seek out each other rather than stand alone?
Look, I understand you' ve experienced a loss, but this relation just can' t work.
I mean, you' re a cat, I am black and I' m not going to be hurt again.
What happened to you?
Ya, once.
It was a Thursday.
Is there something I can help you with detective?
Hey, do you like cats?
- Cats.
No, I' m allergic.
You' re saying cats did this to you?
How the hell would cats do this to me?
Are you crazy?
Why are we talking about cats?
Because I have a cat in my trunk.
Detective, are you going to tell me what' s going on?
I think I' m
Because your shit keeps malfunctioning around me.
A demo bot just tore through Lanning' s house.
Mmm, ya I' m sure it is.
What do you know about the ghosts in the machine.
It' s a phrase from Lanning' s work on the three laws.
He postulated that cognitive simalactra might one day approximate component models of the psyche.
Wow.
Well, that' s great news.
What the hell is that thing doing in here?
We were watching TV.
- It' s my personal NS5.
It' s downloading its daily upgrades from USR.
Most of its systems are off- line until it finishes.
I' m not talking around that thing.
- You' re calling the robot Sonny?
- No, um, it did.
Sonny did.
I didn' t care...
The robot said it was Sonny.
In the lab, there was a cot.
I' ve slept in the office.
When I went to his house, it looked like he hadn' t been there in weeks. and I saw that same survivance strip on the ceiling.
It made his life more convenient.
Maybe. somebody at USR was using those systems to watch him.
- What are you talking about?
- Maybe Lanning was onto something.
Maybe there' s a bigger problem with the robots and Robertson trying to cover it up. - humoring you for no reason... why?
The same old "why".
How much money is there in robots?
All I know is that old man was in trouble and I' m getting sick of doing this shit by myself.
You' re on the inside and you are going to help me find out what is wrong with these robots.
- This is a personal vendetta.
- You putting me on the couch?
OK, I' m on the couch.
One defective machine is not enough.
You need them all to be bad.
You don' t care about Lanning' s death.
This is about the robots and what ever reason you hate them so much.
One of them put a gun in my face, and another one tore a building with me inside.
It says demolition was scheduled for 8 pm this evening. it was 8 am tomorrow, and I don' t give a shit what that thing says.
This is bordering on clinical paranoia.
- You are dumbest, smart person...
What makes your robots so perfect?
What makes them so much God damned better than human beings?
Well, they' re not irrational, or potentially homicidal maniacs for starters.
That is true, they are definitely rational.
You are the dumbest dumb person I' ve ever met.
Or... it because they are cold... and emotionless... and they don' t feel anything?
It' s because they can' t hurt you.
What do you want?
I detected elevated stress pasterns in your voice.
Detective Spooner was just leaving.
- Is that so?
- Ya... one look at the skin and we figure we know just what' s underneath.
The problem is, I do care.
More sophisticated, more intelligent... and of course, 3 laws safe.
With daily uplinks, your new... robot will never be out of communications with USR.
Trade in your NS4 for a bigger, better and brighter future.
This offer cannot last.
Available from USR.
Baby, what happened to your face?
Did that boy, Frank Murphy, beat you up again?
G. G., I haven' t seen Frank Murphy since third grade
I think about it all the time.
I might have to mess around and put you to work.
So, you like the pie, huh?
You can come in now.
I have won, Del, I won the lottery.
We been cooking like crazy.
Baby, you get too worked up about them.
I saw in the news that nice doctor died.
Dr. Lanning was a good man.
He gave me my baby back.
That why you been so upset?
You got to let the past be past.
How did I ever raise such a mess.
I could follow your trail of crumbs all the way to school.
Bread crumbs...
G. G., you' re a genius.
Tell me this isn' t the robot case.
I think he' s trying to tell me something, John.
I think he' s trying to tell me who killed him.
Hey!
He ain' t just some dead guy.
Maybe you should take a break, Del.
We believe the Nester 5 represents the absolute limit which robots can be developed.
No, no, one day they' il have secrets.
One day they' il have dreams.
It' s true, we encourage our scientists to open their minds to just about anything, however, they can get carried away. secrets... dreams...
One day they' il have secrets... one day they' il have dreams.
NS5...
Why didn' t you respond?
You' re scheduled to be de- commissioned at the conclusion of this diagnostic.
22 hundred tomorrow.
VlKI, pause diagnostics.
Command confirmed.
If you find out what is wrong with me, can you fix me?
Maybe.
I think it would be better... not to die.
Connecting.
Show me the last 50 messages between Dr. Lanning and Robertson.
Police access granted to restricted files.
Would you like to listen to some music while you wait?
Excuse me, Mr. Robertson... you requested notification of clearance to restricted files.
Oh, hell, no!
Huh?
I wonder if Deunan is OK?
Hitomi!
It can' t be...
She exceeded the life- extension limit by over three days!
Hitomi!
We are still not sure who was responsible for the Land Mates that attacked Gaea.
This is the end of the ESWAT report for this terrorist attack.
All bioroids, please remain calm.
We are trying to restore the life- extension process.
Please be calm and patient!
Premier Athena, isn' t it beyond ESWAT' s authority to blockade all entrances of Tartarus?
This is the only option under martial law.
We are responsible for protecting Gaea.
Not the D- tank?
To protect Gaea!
Regardless of our Olympus military?
I only chose the best option.
What?
Are you insulting me?
Please, we have no time to argue!
Ladies and gentlemen, this terrorist attack is targeted on the Bioroid population, an unforgivable tragedy.
At this rate, the Bioroids future is doomed.
However, there is only one way to save them and protect Olympus.
It took a long time to make the decision.
We discussed it with Gaea for a long time.
Gaea made the decision.
Gaea wants to make Bioroids truly live.
By making Bioroids procreative.
About the technology to restore Bioroid procreative ability,
I heard that Dr. Gilliam who developed the technology erased all information.
That made the development impossible.
That' s true, General Uranus.
If that technology information was indeed erased, it' s impossible to develop it again.
However the lost information which we called "Apple Seed" does exist!
Soon we will find the lost Apple Seed, and restore the Bioroids procreative ability, make them evolve into a new form of human race, and build a new Utopia.
Hitomi
She' s OK.
Only sleeping
Are you sure she could be saved?
As long as we find the lost Apple Seed.
If not
Her body will degenerate very fast.
She' il die in 24 hours.
All Bioroid will have the same destiny.
I am Premier Athena.
You are you Deunan, right?
Deunan
Do you know Dr. Gilliam?
No.
We did research over twenty years and couldn' t go beyond Dr. Gilliam' s result.
But if we get Dr. Gilliam' s Apple Seed, the Bioroids procreative ability can be restored, and we can become the new human race without the D- tank.
Gaea made the final decision.
Athena, we all depend on you.
Deunan, please help us.
This disc is the only clue?
Is it true that the first generation Bioroids was born in this research center?
Yes, according to my superior.
Why did Athena keep the information on this disc secret?
Why did Dr. Gilliam try to restrain the procreative ability of Bioroids?
Deunan, this mission is dangerous.
We need to concentrate on our job.
I hope Hitomi will be saved.
Don' t think too much.
Can I ask you a question?
In that terrorist attack, your last shot...
Ah, never mind.
Deunan, here.
So this is it.
Kudo, back off.
Dr. Gilliam, we have no time, please go!
Athena, I have to erase the last one.
We' il try to defend the first attack, please hurry.
Mommy
Did you get up?
I can' t believe it...
What' s wrong, Deunan?
Mommy
Deunan, listen carefully.
Mommy hid the most important information inside this necklace.
But bad guys wanted to take it to do bad things.
I had to hide it.
Bad guys?
Yes.
Bad guys that wanted to take away your future.
So protect this necklace by all means.
Nm, Deunan will protect it.
Good girl.
But if Athena asks you for this necklace, give it to Athena.
Only Athena is an exception.
I know.
Only Athena is an exception.
Deunan, protect the "Apple Seed".
Deunan, do you remember the thing we are looking for?
Do you remember?
Carl' s pistol... is Apple Seed inside that necklace?
Don' t move from there please.
Please don' t move!
I beg you, don' t move!
Mommy, mommy!
Deunan, don' t come here!
Don' t shoot!
Mommy
Trouble.
Olympus military.
When...
How did they know we were here?
Too many enemies!
Seaside occupied!
Only one way to the top
To the roof!
Everybody stay calm!
Position:
Room D at 5th floor.
Redon, you betrayed us!
I always hated Bioroids.
As for the traitor, that guy is the first one!
Hades
Deunan, Long time no see.
I regretted I didn' t kill Carl by myself.
No wonder you smell like Bioroid.
With this Cyborg body, you two are still together.
Tell you the truth, I was indeed afraid of the seven old men' s trick.
But to trusting your men is always your weakness, Briareos.
Briareos, what' s going on?
Let me tell you Deunan.
The one behind the attack on Gaea, is Briareos.
Remember my Land Mate got away from him?
Because of him, many Bioroids died.
Is that true?
Tell her you SOB!
Come on give the necklace to me.
Deunan.
Hurry, go to the top!
Hurry!
Kudo!
Go!
Don' t come near!
Stay away from me!
Deunan, give me the necklace now!
They want the necklace, not you.
My mom protected it with her life.
You knew everything from the beginning.
Deunan.
You finally realized it was him, Deunan.
Deunan, I am the Senator Uranus, Commander of Olympus military.
Carl was my old friend, so was Dr. Gilliam.
I even remember when you were a child.
We don' t want to hurt you.
Just give the research information to us.
We prepare to overthrow the legislative institute, destroy the D- tank and eliminate all Bioroids.
Make the human society more human.
But the information in your hand will destroy our plan.
Could you please give it to me?
I refuse.
Deunan
Deunan
Olympus is not the Utopia in Carl and Dr. Gilliam' s dream any more.
I learned fighting skills from my father Carl.
Until now.
General, my Mom told me I could only give this necklace to Athena.
Bioroids aren' t worth your trust.
They will control humanity.
However, there' s one thing I do know:
Bioroids will not kill each other.
General, we are wasting time.
Deunan, it' s a pity.
Athena was protecting human society.
So were Carl and Dr. Gilliam.
They tried to hide Apple Seed to protect humanity.
They wanted to prevent the rapid evolution of Bioroids.
Because Bioroids are dangerous.
No, to continue Dr. Gilliam' s work,
Athena does the research for Bioroid evolution step by step.
General
Bioroids always protect human society.
The reason I helped Hades, was to slow down the evolution process of Bioroids, and keep the lost memories lost.
Athena wanted to hide the secret until the last.
My mission is to give Apple Seed to the Seven Old Men.
So I get the job to protect Deunan.
If so, that necklace must be destroyed.
General, isn' t it rather strange?
They want to destroy the D- tank using the Apple Seed.
Something is important for Athena to protect the D- tank.
General, don' t let the D- tank be destroyed!
Briareos
Don' t be fooled by the machine.
This is revenge, Deunan.
Can you imagine the life I had after I was fired by ESWAT?
This is my revenge on Carl for firing me!
I will kill all Bioroids with his DNA.
I will kill all Bioroids!
Hades
Not my fault, hate your father, Deunan!
I' m sorry.
Don' t speak.
I still feel pain when hit by bullets.
Please, don' t speak anymore.
I always wanted to see you
I just wanted to see you one more time.
Then I was saved by the Seven Old Men.
I only wanted you to be safe, nothing else mattered.
I know.
I became a monster like this.
You didn' t change.
You' re still yourself.
But I cannot protect you any more
I won' t let you die.
Deunan, human...
Briareos
no human sacrifice allowed
The Seven Old Men promised that.
However they were doing something under the table.
Go, hurry!
I cannot leave you here.
The future of this planet is in your hands.
I don' t need a future without you.
Deunan, don' t let your mom die in vain.
Enough.
Deunan.
Briareos
Briareos
Briareos sent an SOS signal when he was hit.
The special structure of Briareos is really perfect.
Just in time to restore the tissue.
He might be saved.
Please save him.
The fuel is enough for the trip.
The ultravibration gravity system is installed now.
Flying is more stable.
The center of gravity has some offset, but no problem for 60 degree rotation.
Deunan, even we Bioroids have a few feelings.
Please save Hitomi.
Mission accomplished.
Good work.
Deunan.
Deunan, good work!
Finally we restored Bioroid procreative ability.
Hitomi has the same life system as humans now.
Hitomi is saved.
I am so happy.
No need to worry any more.
Deunan
It was you who killed my mom?
Did you have my mom killed?
Deunan please forgive us.
That was an accident.
We would have more options.
Why did mom hide Apple Seed?
Dr. Gilliam gave us our only hope.
For the survival of the human race, coexistence of humans and Bioroids is the only way.
But humans never give up fighting. they hate superior races. with a vehemence.
The human race has no ability to run this planet anymore, they discarded Dr. Gilliam' s ideal.
According to Gaea' s prediction, the human race will be destroyed along with earth in three generations.
Deunan, it' s time for the human race to step out of the way.
Step out?
We humans must pass the future of earth over to the Bioroids.
Dr. Gilliam' s virus, will have the most important role in this mission.
A virus developed by my Mom?
Yes, on the top of Tartarus.
Sealed inside the D- tank.
This virus can destroy the procreative ability of human beings.
No sacrifices in the human society.
The human history will end peacefully.
This is the euthanasia of humanity.
So you killed her.
There used to be two options for Olympus: coexistence with Bioroid or evolution to the new human race.
Gaea was produced.
Dr. Gilliam made great effort to produce Gaea.
Gaea worked in Dr. Gilliam' s way.
If Gaea had a different opinion, it would be impossible to release the virus.
Just then, the World War was started. this planet was turned to a wasteland.
Olympus became like this
Gaea was angry about General Uranus' hatred towards Bioroids.
So Gaea made the final judgment.
Use the Apple Seed to make Bioroids the new master race and erase humanity from the history.
You used me.
Used me as the decoy to make Briareos obedient.
Your plan was to trick Gaea into a decison.
Gaea is a hoax.
This is the fate of humanity, Deunan!
At the press of this button, the D- tank at Tartarus will explode.
The virus will spread all over the world.
Stop there, old men!
984G calling, act ASAP!
The button has no use.
what do you want, Athena?
To prevent the perdition of human race, Bioroids were created.
Have you forgotten that?
Bioroids were set to obey the orders of humans.
We are not Bioroids anymore.
Please call us "New Humans".
Athena, this is Gaea' s decision!
It' s the response to Uranus' s rebellion, the punishment to the human atrocity.
General Uranus gave it up just a moment ago.
He is seeking to make peace with us.
General Uranus?
Gaea should have known all these things.
Deunan, Gaea' s spirit is no longer here.
Gaea isn' t here?
The vehemence of the human race is decreasing
Gaea would have reconsidered the judgment.
But the Old Men stopped Gaea, acting on their will.
How interesting, Athena!
The new humans are perfect.
Stopping Gaea should also affect your life- sustain system.
That' s right.
We are going to step out of history with the human race.
What the hell... the Spider cannon...
All Spider cannons are moving toward Olympus!
The Spider cannons are headed toward the top of Tartarus!
No one can stop them.
All ESWAT Land Mates move now!
Attack the cannons!
Stop them by all means!
The defense system of the D- tank is unbreakable, right?
If hit by a Spider cannon at point blank, it will break.
A powerful sword and a perfect shield, which will win?
It' s a tragedy to worship power.
15 minutes until they reach Tartarus at this speed!
How about the evacuation of citizens?
We are trying.
That' s the priority.
Once the cannons enter no- man' s zone, attack immediately!
No. 7 cannon is the control center of all cannons.
Hitomi
Hitomi
I am sorry, grandpas.
If we stop the control box inside No. 7, all cannons will stop.
But DO NOT destroy it!
No. 7 has to be stopped manually.
The access code is hitomi.
Briareos
Deunan, we have a promise.
Deunan, let' s go.
We' re flying.
There' s no point.
The human race will make the planet perish.
Deunan, the human race cannot turn back.
Why not let the new humans bear the sin of the human race?
We will survive even if it' s not a utopia.
We' il build a new future with our own hands!
Deunan.
No way, they have no weakness.
3000 meters to Tartarus!
We cannot hurt them at all!
Captain, we are approaching No. 7!
Cover us!
Which one is No. 7? the one in the middle.
Attack the legs of No. 6 and No. 8!
How about No. 5?
Let it go.
All fire on No. 6 and No. 8!
No. 6 is down!
Good.
How about No. 8?
Let me attract his fire
Deunan you approach him from below.
Roger.
Briareos
Deunan
Cannons have reached Tartarus!
They are climbing toward the top!
Deunan we are out of time.
No. 3 cannon is near the top!
We can' t stop it.
How come?
Why?
Briareos
Deunan, let me go!
I can' t do that!
Hurry, enter the password!
Mother!
They stopped.
All cannons stopped.
The D- tank is safe.
Briareos
Deunan, Hitomi.
Where are the old men?
Oh...
So the last letter of the access code...
They left it up to us.
Nothing changed.
It must be their unwillingness to change that makes the human race guilty.
I will continue fighting even like this.
For our children, for the truly new human race
This subtitle is provided by Nguyen Van Tam
You see how it' s done?
Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.
The boss will chew my head off if these cores get messed up.
Don' t worry.
We' re at 26 feet.
You let Jason operate the drill?
Yeah, he can handle it.
I didn' t do anything.
Give me your hand!
Let go of the drill!
Forget it, Jack!
It' s too late!
You' re not gonna make it!
Jack!
Jack!
Give me your hand!
I' ve got you!
What were you thinking?
- What' s happening?
- The whole damn shelf is breaking off!
That' s what' s happening!
We found evidence of a cataclysmic climate shift, which occurred 10, 000 years ago.
The concentration of these natural greenhouse gases in the ice cores...... indicates that runaway warming pushed Earth into an ice age...... which lasted two centuries.
I' m confused.
I thought you were talking about global warming, not an ice age.
Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming can trigger a cooling trend.
The Northern Hemisphere owes its climate to the North Atlantic Current.
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator and is carried north by the ocean.
But global warming is melting the polar ice caps and disrupting this flow.
Eventually it will shut down.
And when that occurs...... there goes our warm climate.
Excuse me.
When?
I don' t know.
Maybe in 100 years, maybe in 1000.
But what I do know is...... that if we do not act soon, our children and grandchildren will have to pay the price.
And who' s going to pay the price of the Kyoto Accord?
It would cost the world' s economy hundreds of billions of dollars.
With all due respect, Mr. Vice President, the cost of doing nothing could be even higher.
Our climate is fragile.
At the rate we' re burning fossil fuels and polluting the environment...... the ice caps will soon disappear.
Professor Hall...... our economy is every bit as fragile as the environment.
Perhaps you should keep that in mind before making sensationalist claims.
Well, the last chunk of ice that broke off...... was about the size of Rhode Island.
Some people might call that pretty sensational.
Stop global warming!
I' m at the Global Warming Conference in New Delhi...... where, if you can believe it, it' s snowing.
The coldest weather on record has thrown the city into chaos...... with numbers of homeless people freezing to death.
Taxi!
I enjoyed your testimony, professor.
It was very spirited.
Oh, thank you.
That' s what we' re here for, right?
Put on a good show?
Quite.
I was wondering if I could talk to you about your theory on abrupt climate shift.
The name' s Rapson.
Terry Rapson.
- Professor Rapson?
Of the Hedland Center?
- That' s me.
I' ve read your work on ocean currents.
- What do you say to a spot of tea?
- Absolutely.
If we can hail a cab.
Over here.
Welcome back to Glasgow, Scotland, where Manchester United...... leads 3 - 1 over hometown Celtic.
We return 63 minutes into the second half as Manchester United...... looks to put the game out of reach.
Let' s get back to our commentator...... Donald MacFarland.
What?
Yeah.
- I just closed my eyes for a sec, man.
- Yeah.
The baby kept us awake all night.
- And still.
- Yeah!
Dennis?
NOMAD buoy 4311 is showing a temperature drop of 13 degrees.
- Yeah?
Where is 4311?
- Well, it' s...
- Georges Bank.
- It' s rough seas out there.
Must have knocked it about.
Come on!
Come on, kick it now.
Kick it!
- Kick it!
- Are the lads winning?
Hello, professor.
How was India?
Oh, you know what these scientific gatherings are.
All dancing girls, wine and parties.
The fury of Hurricane Noelani stunned weather experts yesterday...... slamming into the island chain with a cataclysmic force never before witnessed.
Meteorologists already believe this to be the strongest hurricane ever recorded...
Are you gonna get that?
It will surely leave a wake of death...
- Hello?
- I just saw that Sam got an F in calculus.
I' m aware, Jack.
I get a copy of his report card too.
Sam is a straight- A student.
He doesn' t fail classes.
I don' t have time to talk about this now.
Well, maybe you ought to make time.
Excuse me, I' m not the one who' s away for months and months at a time.
I just don' t understand.
I' il let him explain it.
Can you take him to the airport in the morning?
- Sam' s getting on a plane?
- He joined the Scholastic Decathlon Team.
- They' re competing in New York.
- Sam joined a team?
- Yeah, I think there' s a girl involved.
- Oh.
Look, can you pick him up at 8: 30?
I gotta go because I' m on call tonight.
I don' t want him taking a taxi again.
Okay.
Okay?
I' il be there.
This morning' s weather staff meeting has been moved to level four, room B.
Jack?
I know you' re good at rubbing people the wrong way...... but why would you aggravate the vice president?
Because my 17- year- old kid knows more science than he does.
Your 17- year- old kid does not control our budget.
- Who cares if he hates you.
- My son doesn' t hate me.
If Raymond Becker pulls our budget...
- Wait...
Jack.
Oh, my God.
- I' m sorry I' m late.
- Dad, the cab' s already here.
That' s okay.
I' il take care of it.
- What are...?
- Here you go.
I' m not angry.
I' m disappointed.
- Do you want to hear my side of it?
- How can there be two sides?
I got every question right on the final.
Mr. Spengler failed me...... because I didn' t write the solutions.
- Why not?
I do them in my head.
- Did you tell him that?
He didn' t believe me.
He said if he can' t do them in his head, I' m cheating.
How can he fail you for being smarter than he is?
That' s what I said.
You did?
- How' d he take it?
- He flunked me, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Sam, I' m sorry.
I jumped to conclusions.
I' m gonna call this guy and have a word with him.
We' il straighten this out.
Hey, you can' t park there.
- Don' t worry about it.
- Sam?
Sam.
Parker, this is Houston.
We' re seeing some bad weather over Canaveral.
It doesn' t look like you' re coming back this week.
Your wife' s gonna give me an earful.
Roger that.
Hey, come take a look at this storm system.
It' s enormous.
You all right?
He' s afraid of flying.
I' m fine.
Statistically, the chance of a plane going down because of turbulence...... is less than, what, one in a billion?
Or is it a million?
- I can' t remember if it' s a...
- Shut up, Brian.
They' re still serving drinks.
Folks, it appears we' re gonna have a bit of a bumpy ride for the next few minutes.
Thank you.
Whoa!
Grab it.
Watch out!
Sam?
Sam.
Can I have my hand back?
I can' t believe I' il be alone with my mom.
Be patient with her.
She' s been looking forward to this holiday.
I know.
I love you.
I love you too.
Hey.
Hey, hello.
Bye- bye.
The cause of this extreme weather remains a mystery, although some meteorologists...... believe sunspots are to blame.
This is very odd.
There' s a buoy registering a 13- degree drop in ocean temperature.
Oh, yeah, that' s right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.
I' il see if there are ships near Georges Bank to get it.
This buoy isn' t in Georges Bank.
It' s just off Greenland.
What?
- Remote.
Make that three.
Just another typical day in New York City.
Traffic jam, 10 blocks long.
Look here, Buddha.
These people, and their cars, and their exhaust...... and they' re polluting the atmosphere.
Excuse me, sir.
We' re really late.
We' re almost there.
- We' re only two blocks away.
- Let' s walk.
What' s gotten into them?
I have no idea.
They' re all worked up today.
In 1532, Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro...... defeated this Incan emperor at the Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca.
What is his name?
Time.
Montezuma.
No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico, not Peru.
It' s, like, Anta- something.
- Atahualpa?
- That' s it!
Time' s up.
Correct answers, please.
That' s five points for Woodmont and five points for Pinehurst Academy.
Next question.
In what year did Louis Quatorze ascend to the throne of France?
This place is so retro, it might actually be cool if it were on purpose.
Yeah, look at all these nerds.
Hey.
Hey.
You look beautiful.
Thanks.
This place is incredible.
Do you believe this is their cafeteria?
You played a great first round.
So did you.
These are my teammates, Sam and Brian.
- I' m Laura.
- Oh, I' m J. D.
- Your school' s amazing.
- Would you like a tour?
Sure.
That' d be great.
Could you hold this for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Man, you got some serious competition.
Please.
- And I' il bet he' s really rich too.
- Shut up.
- Who is it?
- Terry Rapson here.
Sorry to call you so early.
No, professor, it' s all right.
What is it?
Well, we' ve found something extraordinary.
Extraordinary and disturbing, that is.
You recall what you said in New Delhi about how polar melting...... might disrupt the North Atlantic Current?
- Yes.
Well...... I think it' s happening.
What do you mean?
I' ve sent you an e- mail.
Hold on.
At first we thought it was a malfunction.
But there are four more across the North Atlantic showing the same thing.
This is unbelievable.
You predicted it would happen.
Yes, but not in our lifetime.
This is too fast.
There are no forecast models remotely capable...... of plotting this scenario, except yours.
It' s not a forecast model.
It' s the closest thing we have.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
At least not in the last 10, 000 years.
As I predicted yesterday, the swell off Hurricane Noelani is incredible.
Just take a look.
- Shouldn' t you be monitoring the weather?
- This is L. A. What weather?
Wait.
What' s that noise?
What noise?
Honey, I' il be right back.
The Coast Guard closed the beaches, as waves have grown too big for...
- L. A. Weather Center.
- It' s Tommy.
I' m in the middle of something, Tommy.
What do you need?
There' s hail the size of golf balls coming down here.
A low- pressure system along the California coast...... is creating a cyclonic system across the L. A. Basin.
- Yeah?
- Boss, turn on The Weather Channel.
- I think we have to issue a tornado warning.
- What are you talking about?
Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting wind speeds in excess...
- Conditions highly unusual for California.
We' re building a forecast model, we need...
Priority access to the mainframe for two days, maybe three.
- Oh, is that it?
Anything else?
- We need it immediately.
I would say that you' ve lost your mind...... but you' ve been this way for the past 20 years.
- Tom, this is important.
- What' s this forecast model you' re building?
Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall.
Janet' s a hurricane specialist with NASA.
Jack' s a paleoclimatologist, and I have absolutely no idea what he' s up to.
Booker.
What' s going on here?
They just issued a tornado warning in Los Angeles.
Mixed reports are coming in about some extreme weather occurring in the area.
Okay, we' re now going live to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles.
Are you there, Bart?
These tornados are forming so fast...
- Bart!
- What?
Oh, my God.
Lisa, are you getting this on camera?
This tornado just erased the Hollywood sign.
It' s just shredded.
Is anyone hurt?
I wouldn' t be surprised.
There is so much damage.
And there are people down there taking pictures.
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
Go for cover!
You can' t stay here!
Get out of here!
What you' re seeing are two actual tornados striking Los Angeles International Airport.
Wait.
It looks like they' ve joined and formed one large tornado.
- Tommy!
- Oh, my God!
Holy shit!
I' d like to urge all of our viewers to stay away...
- Jeff, where are you?
- I' m on Yucca and Vine.
- You' re on TV.
You' re in the middle of it.
God!
Oh, my God!
You gotta get out of there, man.
That bus just got dropped on top of that Porsche!
Oh, my God.
I hope no one was in that car.
For our national audience just joining us now...... we are going live to downtown Los Angeles right now.
Tommy?
If you look over there behind me, that' s a tornado.
Yes, a twister in Los Angeles.
It' s one of many tornados that are destroying our city.
That' s the Los Angeles skyline.
It' s unbelievable!
It' s huge!
I' ve never seen anything like it.
What' s happening?
It looks like some sort of...... huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare, only this is the real thing.
Yes, I' m looking at it right now.
- Yes, it is.
- What' s happening?
I' il call you back.
Mr. President, Los Angeles has been devastated by a series of tornados.
On top of that, the FAA wants your approval to suspend all air traffic.
- What do you think we should do?
- Until we can figure it out...... I don' t think we have much choice, sir.
What you' re seeing is what' s left of downtown Los Angeles.
Hey, man, I just got off the phone with my mom.
I' m really sorry, but we need to change the channel.
The FAA has grounded all air traffic in the United States.
Unfortunately, the order came too late for two planes...... brought down by severe turbulence in the Midwest.
- The first flight...
- So much for "one in a billion."
All right.
All right, listen up, everybody.
Listen up, please.
We' ve got a lot of work to do, and we don' t have much time...... so let' s get started, please.
Vorsteen?
All our grid models are worthless.
I don' t think grid models are gonna be a lot of help here.
Canadians report tremendous circulation moving from the Arctic.
In Siberia, there' s a low- pressure system never before seen.
And Australia just saw the strongest typhoon ever recorded.
- These things are interconnected?
- We have to consider the possibility.
The only force strong enough to affect global weather is the sun.
- What' s NASA have to say?
- We' ve already checked.
Solar output is normal.
- What about the North Atlantic Current?
- What about it?
I got a call last night from Professor Rapson at the Hedland Center.
He thinks the current has changed.
How could that be?
The current depends upon a balance of salt and freshwater.
- We all know that.
- Yes...... but no one knows how much freshwater has been dumped into the ocean...... because of melting polar ice.
I think we' ve hit a critical desalinization point.
It would explain what' s driving this extreme weather.
Hedland had some pretty convincing data.
They' ve asked me to feed it into my paleoclimate model to track the next events.
Are you suggesting these weather anomalies are gonna continue?
Get worse.
I think we' re on the verge of a major climate shift.
What are you gonna tell the Administration?
- What do you expect me to tell them?
- The government has to make preparations.
- Give me the mainframe.
I' il prove it.
No.
You have 48 hours.
- Professor Hall.
- Yes.
- I think your theory may be correct.
- Walk with me.
Just a few weeks ago, I monitored the strongest hurricane on record.
The hail, the tornados, it all fits.
Can your model factor in storm scenarios?
- We haven' t had the time.
- Well, maybe I can help.
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.
Hi, I' m Jason.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Do you have Peter' s CT scan results?
The treatments shrunk the tumor 20 percent.
- Is his eyesight better today?
No change.
- Hi, Peter.
How are you doing today?
- A little better.
Good.
Let me listen here.
Can you read that?
No, but I remember the story from the pictures.
You do?
My mother used to read it to me.
She must be very proud of you.
You' ve been such a brave, big boy.
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Jack, you' ve been working for 24 hours straight.
You' re the only one who hasn' t taken a break.
Maybe I' il try to shut my eyes for a while.
Call me when you get the results.
Frank, is he always so obsessive?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
Does he ever lighten up?
- Not really.
- No.
- How long have you been working together?
- Well, Frank' s been working with him...... since the Stone Age, but I' ve only had to endure two years of servitude.
Jack.
Jack, we got the results.
Six to eight months?
That can' t be.
It' s in weeks.
Flooding has caused numerous closures, including the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels.
The plumbing in the school is really old.
With this rain, the sewage got stopped up.
Where are you staying?
They' re finding a place for us with kids here.
You can' t get home any sooner than tomorrow?
Well, look, Dad, I would if I could, you know.
It' s just...
This smell is unbearable, Dad.
Stop kidding around!
I want you home.
Dad, I' il be on the train.
Just don' t worry about me.
I' il figure it out.
All right, son.
I' il see you tomorrow.
We got a place to stay.
Great.
So far, the terrible weather hasn' t hit D. C., but local residents aren' t taking chances...... as people stock up for what is already being billed as...... the worst storm season on record.
- Better be sure.
- My ass is on the line.
- You saw the model.
And I hope to God it' s wrong.
- Mr. Vice President.
- Tom.
- You know Professor Hall.
- Yes, we' ve met.
Professor Hall has some information I think you should look at.
We just got these results from our simulation model.
- They explain what' s causing this weather.
- I have to meet with the director of FEMA...
- This is very urgent.
It will happen over the next six to eight weeks.
You said this wouldn' t happen for another 100 years.
- I was wrong.
- Well, suppose you' re wrong this time.
I wish I were, but you' re aware of what' s happening everywhere.
We' re making all the necessary preparations for this storm.
What more do you expect?
You have to start thinking about large- scale evacuations right now.
Especially in the Northern states.
- Evacuations?
- Yes.
Have you lost your mind, Hall?
I have to go.
If we don' t act now, it' s going to be too late.
Come on, Jack.
Thanks for bringing us here.
I couldn' t let you leave New York without seeing the Natural History Museum.
It' s a fine collection of stuffed animals.
Hey, guys, check this out.
"The body of this mammoth was found perfectly preserved in the Siberian tundra...... with food still in its mouth and stomach...... indicating that it froze instantly while grazing."
It' s been 24 hours now since the snow started falling across the British Isles...... and over Northern Europe.
It shows no signs of letting up.
No, no, no.
No, no.
We' ve got plenty of supplies.
We' re just snowed in.
Yeah.
No, it' s all right.
It' s all right.
I' il be fine.
Yeah, I love you too.
Okay, bye.
- Hey.
How' s Jeanette?
- Oh, fine.
The ferry just landed.
Wish I was there.
An elite RAF search- and- rescue team has been deployed by helicopter...... to airlift the royal family to safety.
- Yeah, you think they' il come get us?
- Not likely.
Luckily we' ve got our own genny, enough tea and biscuits to sink a ship.
Oh, we' il be fine.
As long as the loo doesn' t back up again.
We' ve got zero visibility.
Maintain heading and speed.
- What' s our heading?
- 035, sir.
Approximately 40 kilometers from Balmoral Castle.
We' ve lost visual contact with you.
- This gauge can' t be right.
- Wind speed has dropped to zero.
We have vertical walls of cirrus cloud formations.
- What the hell is going on?
- The bloody fuel lines are starting to freeze.
Port engine pressure is dropping.
The rotor rpm is dropping.
We' ve got a flameout on the starboard side as well.
Prepare for crash landing.
Select emergency fuel.
Come on, you bastard!
Come on!
What I' m about to say is supposed to be confidential.
Several hours ago, three helicopters went down over Scotland.
They crashed because the fuel in their lines froze.
- At what temperature does...?
- Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
We had to look it up.
The temperature dropped phenomenally fast.
On the ground, people froze before they could get out of their cars even.
Can you get a satellite picture of Scotland two hours ago?
We' ve got mountains of data...... but nowhere near enough computer power to analyze it.
We' il do our best.
Thanks, Jack.
Bye for now.
This is Scotland at the time the temperature dropped.
This thing looks just like a hurricane.
Only hurricanes don' t form over land.
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Harold.
- Thanks, Victor.
See you in the morning.
- Right, sir.
- Terrible weather.
- Tell me about it.
Wow.
You live here?
Just on the weekends.
It' s my dad' s place.
He' s kind of never around, so...
Where is he?
Skiing in Europe with my stepmom.
Is this you and your brother?
Yeah, that' s when we took a bike trip together.
It' s been raining like this for three days now.
Come on, hurry up.
I' m just standing here.
You can' t stay here.
I never liked this neighborhood anyway.
It' s a mob scene here at Grand Central Station.
Over half the platforms are flooded and service has been suspended on all trains.
With planes still grounded and trains now out of service...... that' s bad news for the...
Victor' s coming to pick me up.
You guys want a ride to the train station?
Not anymore.
In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds.
What we have feared for the past few days has indeed happened.
The cold front moving from the Arctic...... has created an enormous storm system in Canada...... which, incredible as it sounds, looks more like a tropical hurricane...
I gotta go pick up my little brother.
Do you guys want a ride?
- Where is he?
- He' s in a boarding school in Philadelphia.
If this system moves south...... we could see a wind- driven storm surge threaten the entire Eastern Seaboard.
Okay, bye.
Victor' s stuck in traffic over on Fifth Avenue.
It' il be easier to head out of town if we meet him over there.
- You mean walk?
- No, not in this.
We should take the stairs.
We' re on the top floor.
I guess we' re walking.
Maybe we should just stay here.
I think the young lady is right.
No.
We need to get home.
Hey, Cesar, come here.
What are you doing?
The wolves, they' re gone.
Just to give you an idea of the situation...... which seems to be becoming worse with each passing minute:
At the moment, we have flooding in most parts of the island.
We' ve got traffic snarl- ups because the electricity is now out...... to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals.
Car accidents, at least two hundred.
And lower Manhattan, we' ve been told, is virtually inaccessible.
Will you please phone her for me?
Hey.
That dog can' t come in here.
It' s pouring out there.
I don' t care.
Read the sign.
It' s supposed to be a public library.
Come on, guys, this way.
Excuse me.
Your bad.
Goddamn 1500- dollar waterproof raincoat.
- Please, shut up, man.
- There must be rats everywhere.
That' s because it' s New York.
Hey!
Hey!
- Open up, big papa.
- It' s out of service.
It' s out of service.
- I' il give you a 100 dollars.
- You don' t have to do that.
200 dollars.
I won' t have it.
God, I love buses.
This is so much fun.
This is gonna be the bomb.
Hello?
No signal.
- This is insane.
We should go back.
- Yeah, I vote for that.
We have to get higher!
Come on.
Up to the library.
Calm down.
I can' t understand what you' re saying.
If you stay calm, ma' am, I' il get you out.
The door is jammed!
I don' t speak French!
Hey, where' s Laura?
- She' s right there!
Right there, see?
What is she doing?
Tell them to cover their eyes.
There is a wall of water coming towards New York City.
Everybody...
- What?
Their passports.
Forget about it.
- I' il get it for her.
- Come on.
Oh, my...
Laura!
Laura!
- Sam.
- No!
Brian, no!
Laura!
Laura, look!
Come on.
Come!
Come on!
Sam!
Professor.
Thank you.
- Is that Neville' s handiwork?
- Neville' s way beyond stick figures.
- He' s 6 already.
- Oh.
No, this masterpiece belongs to my second grandson, David.
I can' t believe Neville' s 6 already.
You won' t believe how fast they grow.
I' ve got Jack Hall on the phone.
They' ve run the data we' ve sent them.
Here he is.
Jack, were you able to recreate the thermal cycle?
Yes.
The storm' s rotation...... is pulling super- cooled air all the way down from the upper troposphere.
But shouldn' t the air warm up before it reaches ground level?
But it doesn' t.
The air' s descending too rapidly.
Is this an isolated incident?
I' m afraid not.
We' ve located two supercells in addition to the one over Scotland.
One over Northern Canada...... and another one over Siberia.
And do we know their projected paths?
Yes.
Our previous estimates of six to eight weeks weren' t even close.
This one storm is going to change the face of our planet.
Here' s a projection of 24 hours out.
This is 48 hours out.
And in seven to 10 days...
When this storm is over...... we' il be in a new ice age.
My God.
Professor...... it' s time you got out of there.
I' m afraid that time has come and gone, my friend.
What can we do?
Save as many as you can.
Jack...... something' s happened in New York.
No, the power is out.
I' ve been in here all day.
- Who needs help?
- Here.
Over here.
What?
This is the last one.
Enjoy it.
Greedy.
All circuits are busy at this time.
Listen, thanks for coming back for me.
It was really brave.
I guess I better return her bag.
Sam?
Just tell her how you feel.
Yeah.
- Did you reach your little brother yet?
- No, there' s still no service.
Damn cell phones.
Excuse me.
Are there any pay phones on the upper floors?
No, no, no.
- There are some on the mezzanine.
- Great.
- Where you going?
Power' s out.
Older payphones draw power directly from the line.
There will be an emergency meeting of all NOAA department heads...
Oh, God.
I' ve been trying to reach Sam.
So have I.
I tried to call and couldn' t get you.
Come on.
Are you sure about this?
It works.
I love that picture.
Yeah, so do I.
Where was that taken?
Miami.
Well, where was I?
I don' t remember that trip.
Sam and I went with my sister.
You were in Alaska...... doing research on your doctorate.
Remember what he was like when he was that age?
Everything was "one more."
"One more, Daddy."
Jack.
Sam' s on the phone.
Line four.
- Sam?
- Dad!
- Where are you?
Are you all right?
We' re at the Public Library.
- Sam, it' s Mom.
I' m so happy you' re okay.
- Mom.
Can you call Laura and Brian' s parents and tell them we' re all right?
Yes, of course.
- Sam, what' s that noise?
- Sam?
Sam?
What is going on out there, Dad?
Sam.
Sam, listen to me.
Listen very carefully.
Forget what I said about heading south.
It' s too late.
The storm is gonna get worse.
It' s gonna turn into a massive blizzard with an eye in the center, like a huge hurricane.
Only the air will be so cold, you could freeze to death in seconds.
Sam?
- Well, what should we do?
- Listen to me, son.
Do not go outside.
Burn what you can to stay warm, and try to wait it out.
Do you understand me?
I will come for you.
Sam?
- Sam, come back!
- Sam?
Sam, did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
Sam?
- Tell me he' s gonna be okay...
- He' s gonna be all right.
He' s gonna be all right, you understand?
I thought you' d drowned.
Come on.
Where' d you store the arctic gear?
You can' t make it to New York, Jack.
I' ve walked that far before in the snow.
This is not the same.
Jack, this is not the same.
Lucy, tell him.
I have to do this.
I know.
My hands are shak...
- Shaking.
- That' s okay.
Here.
Come here.
What are you doing?
I' m using my body heat to warm you.
If we let the blood from your arms and legs rush back to your heart too quickly...... your heart could fail.
Where did you learn that?
Some of us were actually paying attention in health class.
How are you feeling?
Much better.
Frank told me about Sam.
I' m not gonna try to talk you out of going, but there' s something I need first.
You have to explain your results to the Administration.
- I already tried that, Tom.
It' il be different.
You' re gonna brief the president directly.
- Is that the last of it?
- Pretty much.
Okay.
We also found this radio, but I don' t think it works.
Let me see it.
Buddha, keep quiet.
You ain' t even supposed to be in here anyway.
Come on, guys.
Oh, my God.
The basic rule of storms is they continue...... until the imbalance that created them is corrected.
In this case, we' re talking about a global realignment.
This superstorm will last seven to 10 days.
When it' s over, ice and snow will cover the entire Northern Hemisphere.
The ice and snow will reflect sunlight.
The Earth' s atmosphere will restabilize...... with an average temperature close to that of the last Ice Age.
Well, what can we do about this?
Head as far south as possible.
That is not amusing, professor.
Where do you suggest they go?
The farther south they go, the safer they' il be.
Parts of Florida that aren' t flooded.
Mexico would be best.
Mexico?
Maybe you should stick to science and leave policy to us.
Well, we tried that approach.
You didn' t want to hear about the science when it could have made a difference.
What exactly are you proposing, professor?
Evacuate everyone south of that line.
What about the people in the North?
I' m afraid it' s too late for them.
If they go outside...... the storm will kill them.
At this point...... their best chance is to stay inside.
Try to ride it out.
Pray.
What do you think he' il do?
I don' t know.
Jack...... thanks...... and good luck.
You too.
We' re all gonna need it.
We can' t evacuate half the country because one scientist thinks the climate is shifting.
- Every minute we delay costs lives.
- What about the other half of the country?
If Professor Hall is right about this storm...... sending troops north will create more victims.
We need to save the people we can right now.
We take the same approach in triage on the battlefield.
Sometimes it' s necessary to make difficult choices...
I don' t accept abandoning half the country as necessary.
Maybe if you listened sooner, it wouldn' t be.
It' s easy for him to suggest this plan.
- He' s safely here in Washington.
- His son is in Manhattan.
I thought you should know before you start questioning his motives.
We' re going to follow Hall' s plan.
- General.
- Sir?
Give the order for the National Guard to evacuate Southern states.
Yes, sir.
Vivian...... get me my wife.
Sorry, mates, but we' re just about out of petrol.
Hey.
Is there any chance...... that it' il run...... on this?
Are you mad?
That' s a 12- year- old Scotch.
Gentlemen.
To England.
To mankind.
To Manchester United.
I just...
I just wish I could have seen him grow up.
You know?
The important thing is he will grow up.
Amen.
Maybe you should have somebody help you with that.
Sir, I am president of the Electronics Club...... the Math Club and the Chess Club.
Now, if there' s a bigger nerd in here, please, point him out.
I' il just leave you alone to work on it, okay?
Come on, Buddha, come on.
Do your business.
Look, there' s nobody around.
I' il turn around.
I promise.
What?
Hey, man, there' s people out there.
I was walking my dog.
There' s hundreds of them.
They' re walking on the snow.
Where they all going?
They' re getting out of the city before it' s too late.
All right, everybody.
Quiet down.
When was the last time anyone got a signal on a cell phone?
I got through to my cousin in Memphis an hour ago.
They' re being evacuated to the South.
We should get moving too.
{100091} The water is frozen over enough to walk on.
{100173} We should get going before the snow gets too deep.
{100264} Everyone, wrap yourselves up as fast as you can.
{100302} We shouldn' t go.
{100351} Why not, Sam?
Everyone' s leaving.
{100420} When I talked to my dad, he told me to stay inside.
{100465} The storm will kill anybody in it.
{100536} - Then you have to say something.
- I know.
{100695} Excuse me, sir, you' re making a mistake.
Listen, we' re all scared, but we' ve got no choice.
{100812} - That' s not it.
- Get ready to go.
{100900} If these people go outside, they will freeze to death!
{100963} Okay, what is this nonsense?
{101055} It' s not nonsense.
All right?
Look, this storm is gonna get worse.
{101117} The people caught outside will freeze to death.
{101188} - Where are you getting this?
- My dad' s a climatologist.
{101256} - He works for the government.
- So what do we do?
{101324} We stay inside, we keep warm, and we wait it out.
{101378} The snow is getting deeper by the minute.
{101444} We' d be trapped here without food, supplies... {101498} - It' s a risk, yeah...
- An unnecessary risk.
It' s not.
Come on.
{101632} Let' s go.
{101716} - Look, look.
Just look for a second.
- Come on, everybody... {101802} This storm is gonna get bad.
It' s gonna get really, really bad.
{101858} You' re not gonna be able to survive it.
{101919} Believe me.
{102027} Sir, please just stay.
Just stay.
{102099} Just don' t...
{102871} - She' s set to go.
- Come on, straight to the back, guys.
{102925} It' il be impossible to reach each other.
{102993} Leave a message for me at the embassy in Mexico City.
{103026} Okay, I will.
{103101} I love you.
{103240} I love you, Jack.
{103330} Tell Sam I love him so much.
{103413} God be with you.
{103631} - Doctor Hall?
- Yeah.
{103693} We haven' t been able to reach Peter' s parents.
- Okay.
Thank you.
{104005} I got it.
{104091} You' re supposed to be on a bus heading south.
{104203} I' ve been watching your back for 20 years.
You think I' d let you go alone?
{104285} And all these years I thought I was watching your back.
{104331} Where are the keys?
{104378} In the truck.
{104449} Where do you think you' re going?
{104511} Neither one of you can navigate worth a damn.
{104563} Without me, you' il end up in Cleveland.
{104694} I' il try to give you updates on the storm as it heads your way.
{104754} Good luck, Jack.
{105146} Breaking news from the U. S. - Mexico border.
{105231} Just half an hour ago, Mexican officials closed the border... {105323}... in the light of so many U. S. refugees who are fleeing south... {105381}... in the wake of the approaching storm.
{105457} These people came in anticipation of crossing into Mexico.
{105514} Instead, they' ve been met with closed gates.
{105598} And now, in a dramatic reversal of illegal immigration... {105687}... thousands of people are crossing the Rio Grande into Mexico.
{105780} The scene unfolding here behind me is one of desperation and frustration.
{105867} People have abandoned their cars, grabbed their belongings... {105982}... and they are wading across the river illegally into Mexico.
{106078} Here it is.
{106196} This fireplace probably hasn' t been used in about 100 years.
{106301} All right.
{106523} - What are you doing?
- What did you think we would burn?
{106607} - You can' t burn books.
- No, absolutely not.
{106654} You want to freeze to death?
{106778} I' il go get some more.
{106817} I' il help you.
{106878} I' m going with them.
{106969} Okay, do you have a cafeteria or a lunchroom?
{107041} Just an employees' lounge with a few vending machines.
{107294} We' re not gonna last long on M& M' s and potato chips.
{107349} What about the garbage cans?
{107415} There' s always something to eat in the garbage.
We can' t burn Nietzsche.
{107653} He was the most important thinker of the 19th century.
{107728} Please.
He was a chauvinist pig in love with his sister.
{107771} He was not a chauvinist pig.
{107832} But he was in love with his sister.
You guys?
{107979} Yeah, there' s a whole section on tax law down here that we can burn.
{108064} After hours of uncertainty, the traffic is now moving smoothly... {108121}... from the United States into Mexico.
{108218} This is only possible because the president was able to negotiate a deal... {108328}... to forgive all Latin American debt in exchange for opening the border.
{108431} Now, multitudes of American families are feeling a rush of relief...
{108561} Lucy?
{108738} Is Peter' s ambulance here?
{108782} No.
{108967} - Why?
- They' ve all gone.
{109009} - What?
- In the confusion... {109101}... I don' t know what happened.
People started to panic, and they left... {109159} - God.
- There' s a policeman with a snowplow.
- God.
{109286} Peter can' t be moved in anything but an ambulance.
{109405} I called and left a message for the county ambulance service.
{109626} Okay.
{109739} Okay, you should go, and I' il stay and wait.
{109783} Lucy, no.
- No, you should go.
{109882} He' s not gonna wait forever.
{109931} It' s okay.
{110040} I' m sorry.
{110129} - It' s okay.
- All right.
{110846} You all right?
{110921} Yeah, I' m fine.
I cut my leg the other day.
{111053} Did you get a signal?
{111107} Yeah, for a minute.
{111142} And?
{111291} Man, this storm is everywhere.
{111352} It' s hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.
{111431} Europe is buried under 15 feet of snow... {111500}... and they say it' s gonna get just as bad here.
{111580} I mean, I don' t think your dad' s gonna make it.
{111711} No, he' il make it.
{111870} He' il make it.
{112047} The White House has ordered a national disaster alert... {112085}... for all Northern states.
{112155} Continued exposure to the approaching storm is deadly.
{112253} Remain indoors and take all measures to stay warm, burning any fuel sources... {112346}... until the storm is over.
Roads are impassable across New York State... {112405}... as far south as Pennsylvania... {112456} Where are we?
{112573} Looks like we' re just north of Philadelphia.
{112690} Look out!
{112838} You guys okay?
{112874} - Yeah.
- Yeah.
{113092} - Once again, roads across the...
- Sorry, boss.
{113173} Unpack the snowshoes.
{113223} We' re walking from here.
{113328} Come on, ma' am.
Let' s get up and get going.
{113445} We' ve only made it to Brooklyn.
Maybe we should just turn back.
{113536} Why?
There' s nothing to go back to.
{113578} Time to get up and keep moving.
{113650} What we should' ve done is stayed in the library.
{113752} Okay, guys, let' s get moving.
{114028} Wake up.
{114487} What are you doing?
{114532} Insulating.
{114595} Newspaper' s best, but this' il do.
{114695} You know, you spend some years on the streets and you learn how to keep warm.
{114765} Hey.
{114934} Thanks.
{115071} I got one.
{115124} Your favorite vacation.
{115213} Besides this one?
{115268} All right.
{115373} I went to Greenland with my dad on one of his research trips a few years ago...
{115538}... and the ship broke down, and we got stuck.
{115625} And it rained constantly.
{115726} That sounds really boring.
{115813} But actually really nice, you know?
{115900} Just me and my dad hanging out for 10 days.
{117683} Frank!
{117731} Are you all right?
{117764} I' m fine.
{117871} I just dropped in to do a little shopping.
{117940} I gotta lose this sled.
{118397} Hold on!
We' il pull you up.
{118528} Jason!
You' ve got to support Frank' s weight.
{118598} Okay, I' il try.
{118814} Okay, I think I have his weight now.
{118860} I' m coming to you.
{119228} The glass is breaking!
{119315} Too much weight.
{119444} It' s not gonna hold.
{119709} No.
No.
{119789} Frank.
I can get you out.
{119881} Don' t do it!
{119944} - No, Frank, no!
- Frank, no!
{120029} Frank!
{121117} What have you got there?
{121196} A Gutenberg Bible.
{121256} It was in the rare books room.
{121328} You think God' s gonna save you?
I don' t believe in God.
{121494} You' re holding onto that Bible pretty tight.
{121545} I' m protecting it.
{121713} This Bible is the first book ever printed.
{121852} It represents the dawn of the age of reason.
{121959} As far as I' m concerned, the written word is mankind' s greatest achievement.
{122004} You can laugh.
{122103} But if Western civilization is finished... {122214}... I' m gonna save at least one little piece of it.
{123146} We heard somebody was left behind.
{123258} - We brought an ambulance.
- Thank God.
{123382} Thank you so much for coming.
{123919} Hey.
{123994} Hey, are you all right?
{124077} You look like you have a fever or something.
{124155} I' m fine.
I just can' t sleep.
{124358} My mind keeps going over all those worthless decathlon facts.
{124452} - It' s pretty stupid, huh?
- No, it' s all right.
{124540} I guess you just haven' t had time to adjust yet.
{124645} How am I supposed to adjust, Sam?
{124754} Everything I' ve ever cared about, everything I' ve worked for... {124854}... has all been preparation for a future that no longer exists.
{125033} I know you always thought I took the competition too seriously.
{125109} You were right.
{125193} - It was all for nothing.
- No, no.
I just said that to avoid admitting the truth.
{125391} Truth about what?
{125569} About why I joined the team.
{125745} I joined it because of you.
{126094} Hey.
{126753} I know.
{126790} I know.
{126845} - Mr. President.
- All right.
{126920} I' m sorry, sir, we can' t wait any longer.
{126981} We' re the last ones.
{127040} All right.
{127444} Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26.
{127529} We' ve got an urgent message for high command.
{127586} Request priority for landing zone one.
{127685} Roger that, Delta 26.
Transport will be waiting.
{127841} - Sir.
- Thank you, corporal.
- Carry on.
{128246} Madam Secretary.
{128515} Raymond.
{128598} The president' s motorcade got caught in the storm.
{128758} They didn' t make it.
{128972} And she wouldn' t wake up this morning.
I... {129034} She only had a fever.
I don' t understand.
{129091} She' s awfully pale.
{129155} None of us has had anything real to eat in days.
{129231} - It' s hypothermia.
- But how can it be hypothermia?
{129284} - We' ve all been in...
- Maybe it' s the flu.
{129344} No, no, it' s not the flu.
{129402} And how do you know?
{129500} Books can be good for things other than burning.
What are her symptoms?
She' s got a really cold sweat.
{129641} How' s her pulse?
{129709} - It' s really fast.
- Does she have any injuries?
{129774} Like a cut that might have gotten infected?
{129862} She was complaining about a cut on her leg a few days ago.
{129943} I didn' t think anything of it.
{130091} Oh, my gosh.
{130196} That' s blood poisoning.
Septicemia.
{130251} She could go into septic shock.
{130306} I' ve seen that before.
That can get bad.
{130359} She needs a massive dose of penicillin... {130450}... or a broad- spectrum antibiotic immediately, or...
{130626} Or what?
{131157} I' ve never seen anything like it.
{131248} There' s no point of reference.
All I can see is cloud cover.
{131288} What are you doing?
{131349} Taking infrared image of thermal currents.
{131466} Send to Houston, Korolev, your weather service.
{131508} I' il help you.
{131592} Tom?
{131701} I just received some satellite images from the space station.
You better take a look.
{132015} How big is this thing?
{132068} The vortex is 50 miles in diameter.
{132160} And growing.
The two cells over Europe and Asia are even bigger.
{132195} Good God.
{132270} This one' s gonna hit New York inside an hour.
{132700} Jason!
{132743} Are you all right?
{132798} Jason!
{133260} - What are you doing?
- There' s gotta be medicine on that ship.
{133348} I thought you said it was too dangerous to go outside.
{133385} I know I did.
{133594} Where did you find those chairs?
{133659} Why?
{133717} I' m going with you.
{133788} Me too.
{135354} Come on, damn it!
{136582} - It' s all in Russian.
- I know.
{136669} - Hey, hey, hey, guys.
How do you know?
{136734} Because it says "penicillin" on the bottle.
This is the mess hall.
{136966} - We should find some food.
- We don' t have time.
{137065} Listen, none of us are gonna survive much longer without food.
{137127} Okay.
{137306} - Sam, over here.
- What?
{137360} Bingo.
{137665} Brian?
{137746} - I' m okay.
- What happened?
{137819} All I did was open up the cupboard.
{137900} - Well, we can use it.
- Put food in it.
{138256} Pull him in, Brian!
- Oh, my God, there' s more.
{138494} My leg.
{138632} Here, use this.
{138862} It should be over New York by now.
{138991} Satellite readings are showing a temperature drop of 10 degrees per second.
{139399} You guys... {139453}... I think we' re in the eye of it.
{139524} We gotta get back right now.
{139655} Look, I' m gonna go outside, and I' m gonna lure the wolves out of the room.
{139716} When they leave, you lock the door.
{139759} Good luck.
- I need something.
{141467} Come on, hurry!
Brian, open the door!
{141913} We have to get out of here now.
{141969} Brian, get the supplies.
{143386} Oh, shit.
Let' s go!
{143433} Pull, Brian!
{144352} Take the medicine to Laura.
{145179} We' re almost there.
Come on!
{145274} Brian!
Close the door!
{145597} Don' t let the fire go out!
{145643} What' s happening?
{145870} Buddha, come away from the door.
{145910} Come, Buddha, come!
{145993} More books!
More books!
{147331} How long have I been out of it?
{147399} Couple hours.
{147439} How do you feel?
{147512} Okay.
What happened?
{147628} Well, we had to get inside in kind of a hurry, so I sort of pushed you in.
{147706} I should be used to you pushing me around.
{147790} Good to have you back.
{147958} What are you doing?
{148087} The eye of the storm has passed, and we' re 40 miles from Manhattan.
{148131} Shouldn' t we wait one more day?
{148258} Sam may not have one more day.
{150046} What do you think' s gonna happen to us?
{150100} What do you mean?
Everybody.
{150366} Mankind survived the last Ice Age.
{150448} We' re certainly capable of surviving this one.
{150563} All depends on whether or not we' re able to learn from our mistakes.
{150705} I sure as hell would like a chance to learn from mine.
{150787} You did everything you could.
{150910} I was thinking about Sam.
{151123} Jack, you know the chances of Sam...
{151461} I made my son a promise.
{151536} I' m going to keep it.
{152174} Parker, this is Houston.
Do you read?
{152225} Roger, mission control.
Go ahead.
{152322} We' ve got scattered reports that the storm is dissipating over North America.
{152379} Can you confirm?
{152496} Affirmative.
It' s finally clearing.
{152627} I can see landmass for the first time in days.
{155331} How much further is it to the library?
{155379} It should be...
{155489}... right here.
{155640} I' m sorry, Jack.
{156586} Sam?
{158287} Who is that?
{158476} My father.
{158624} You made it.
{158776} Of course I did.
{159540} EMBASSY OF THE UNlTED STATES OF AMERlCA
{160044} Mr. President.
{160173} I' ve just received a shortwave radio transmission from Jack Hall.
{160226} He made it to New York.
{160289} He says there are survivors.
{160372} Thank you, Tom.
{160434} That' s... {160502} That' s good news.
{160851} These past few weeks have left us all with a profound sense of humility... {160933}... in the face of nature' s destructive power.
{161026} For years, we operated under the belief that we could continue... {161163}... consuming our planet' s natural resources without consequence.
{161228} We were wrong.
{161306} I was wrong.
{161427} The fact that my first address to you comes from a consulate on foreign soil... {161519}... is a testament to our changed reality.
{161569} Not only Americans... {161658}... but people all around the globe are now guests in the nations... {161729}... we once called The Third World.
{161838} In our time of need, they have taken us in and sheltered us.
{161938} And I am deeply grateful for their hospitality.
{162556} We mourn the loss of a spirited leader whose courageous order to evacuate... {162672} Peter?
Hey, you feeling okay today?
{162745} For days, we' ve despaired about the fate of the people... {162805}... who are trapped in the North.
{162893} Today, there is cause for hope.
{163004} Only a few hours ago, I received word that a small group of people... {163087}... survived in New York City against all odds... {163160}... and in the face of tremendous adversity.
{163228} I' ve ordered an immediate search- and- rescue mission... {163325}... to bring them home and to look for more survivors.
{164099} Jack!
{164195} It' s good to see you.
Come on, let' s go get on board.
{165569} Look at that.
{165612} What?
{165711} Have you ever seen the air so clear?
Dad.
My daughter.
Your presence will certainly brighten up this evening.
Someday he' il accept you.
This is mr.
Wong - Who?
He' s the one giving this reception
He is a businessman and he' s leading a powerful triad
Please, sit down
How elegant - Mr Wong is very generous and very powerful
He is very distinguished.
- Totally.
I wonder how much he' s worth?
Quickly.
There are 2 intruders in your office.
Block all the exits.
Who could that have been?
The question is not who it was, but who gave the order.
Don' t do it
Do you have him?
- We must go.
Bring the dragon to safety We let them run for a while.
See you at the meeting
Our lifes will change, Tsu.
Thank you for coming.
We know eachother from stories of others.
Everybody does his thing.
We can make our sport public together.
You want to do a game so we can get to know eachother?
Hi, I am Logan - Kenjee.
We make two teams.
Do you see that roof there?
The team that puts the ball there, wins.

Why not?
What is this about?
A gym for young people of the street. come on.
Sorry.
My little son is waiting for me - I' ve got nothing against exoticism.
I' il help.
It' s on the way.
Instead of spreading out we are going to Thailand together.
About these things you should never think so much
Come.
This is cool, Leo
When does the training start?
- We should do something like that overhere.
This is gonna be great, guys.
It' s magical
You have a paradise here You really feel like home.
I became worried
Do you have it?
Show me - I dont have it.
I left it where it belongs We' re sorry we wasted your time.
You turn to someone else.
No wait, she is still young.
Don' t listen, master.
Let us show you our loyalty
By crawling for him?
We beg you to accept our apologies.
This theft should humiliate Mr. Wong for the final strike.
Then I would rule the city You owe me one.
Watch out.
Kitano, you know our rules
Our members dont marry outsiders
I know.
Because I love a chinese.
like an ordinary servant
But I swear, Misawa, that I will return as a master.
I give my family her lost honour back.
If you fail, you will lose a lot more.
And above all, your wife.
I can also succeed.
I can take over the lion section of Wong' s empire.
I am his son in law.
If he likes it or not.
Watch out for Kien and Tsu.
They can betray you.
They are chinese themselves.
It wouldn' t take a lot of effort for them.
They are hungry.
They will go until the end.
Yeah, mate.
I want chicken
I dont want your sausage.
No, the entire chicken the chicken that I see there. boc boc boc.
It' s for the three of us.
No, that' s meat.
I dont want that I want the entire chicken.
Rice, chicken.
That chicken there.
Easy.
- Be calm.
No one is reacting.
- Nevermind.
If I watch, I' m an accessory - Control yourself.
Come with me.
- That was amazing.
I know someone that will be happy
Come on, guys.
Dont be afraid
So, that' s better eh?
I hear you are going to your grandfather - Yeah, I intended to go.
Has it been long since you saw him?
- I dont know him.
Perhaps that' s why I' m a bit scared
He will be happy to see you.
- I hope so.
Our mixed blood will always be a problem.
Only the yakuza offer us a future.
Why you want to destroy everything so close to the target?
We' ve made a mistake, Kien.
From the beginning.
My little sister that knows and understands everything.
Someday the triads will kill us for what we have done.
And if they dont do it, Kitano will.
He needs us.
She didn' t make sacrifices to let us become criminals.
Because of her blood the triads have banned us. as ordinary strangers
Tell me what she has left us... other than sadness and fear to live.
She' s dead, Kien.
I will always be there for you.
Anyone wants to excersize?
I dont trust it.
- We try it.
OK, lets go
Look out!
That' s to dangerous.
I wont let them go now.
Hey frenchman Weren' t we clear enough?
Leo, do you know them?
Triangle
You must always put yourself in the place of the person you are going to hit.
Let' s get out of here.
Hey frenchman, pass on this message:
It' s not a playground.
Come.
Thanks for your help.
- You are here on his territory.
Why? we didn' t want to fight.
We just wanted to excersize excersize?
He' s not allowed to see us together.
Go away, or he' il kill you all
You should have warned us.
- I didn' t expect this.
But if you give in, you dont have a life.
I thought I was done with it.
- Which is not the case.
We have played with our lives.
- Sorry, but I' m not going to give up my gym.
The day when your agression will dominate you... it will be too late.
What are you going to do?
- Put my thoughts in order.
If you want to stay, you are welcome. - thank you.
I' ve to go too.
And you?
- I' m going home.
I' ve been gone too long.
Let' s spend the night here.
Tomorrow we take a morningflight.
Come, we should find a hotel.
Is it far?
Are you counting?
No.
It' s the names of those that are not there anymore, to never forget them.
What are you talking about?
The war in my village.
I' d rather not talk about it.
Is he there?
- Yes he is.
Do you want to speak to him?
You want to talk with him.
- Put him on the phone take it easy.
I' m far away, but I love you and think about you a lot.
Really?
- You shouldn' t doubt that.
Do you still have my necklace?
- I will never take it off.
Daddy, I miss you - I love you and your mother a lot.
Mommy, daddy has to tell you something.
- Yeah.

Divorced?
- No, just far from eachother.
And you?
- I didn' t find the right one yet.
Different than others.
Kien?
Come on in.
Any idea on what we are going to do?
I dont travel thousands of kilometers just to fight in Bangkok.
That' s not for me anymore.
Ik had het haar moeten vragen. - who? the small asian?
She' s on the wrong side.
- I dont want to judge her so soon.
Have you already forgotten what happened?
- I know
She only brings troubles.
Forget about her.
Kenjee, dont ruin your life.
He' s not worth it.
No.
Cut it out, Kenjee.
What are you doing here?
I didn' t mean it.
Leave me alone.
- Can' t we talk?
What are you afraid of?
You came looking for me.
Go away.
Please.
Daddy.
- My boy.
I' m glad to receive you here with me in my house.
I' m only here to make my daughter happy.
It is good to reconcile our families and cultures with eachother.
Our ways are too different.
You will never understand that.
An old rule of our triad says I will never be able to trust you.
Kitano.
I' ve to go.
Thank you for this second chance.
Wong has been waiting long for someone to follow him up.
- I will not disappoint you now.
I' il be right back.
- Are you crazy?
Not today, guys.
Come back tomorrow.
They got away good. - Ze kwamen goed weg.
- Do you want to trump them?
It is tempting.
- What?
I wont be part of it.
Yaguy, Come for a second
He is right, he' s a father.
But I' m in.
Otherwise I can forget about my gym
We take him to the airport and tackle them.
Alright, but quickly.
Take me with you...
There she is.
There.
Tsu, Kien wants to talk to you.
Tell him he solves it by himself - Do it yourself.
That idiot still doesn' t understand.
Mind your own business.
Hurry.
This way.
Come with me
Trust me.
Your grandfather knew that you would come
He has told me so much about you that I know you better than yourself.
- Thank you for seeing me.
Your grandfather would have been proud if he knew you would be amongst his people.
I should have come much sooner.
He' s still here, you know.
His spirit still waits for you.
This temple is his residence He has not left it.
He' s here and there.
Everywhere at once
He' s in the trees.
He' s in the wind.
He' s in you
They will never find us here.
- I want an explanation
What do you want with my life story?
- Maybe I want to stay then
You wont understand anyway - We shall see.
He took care for me when I was small.
Without him I would be dead.
I can' t just abandon him.
What is he to you?
My brother.
Let me help you then.
Wong has been waiting long for someone to follow him up.
This kidnapping is breaking his heart.
Kitano was very serious.
We can also do it without her.
But what did she do with him?
Can' t she see that he is dangerous?
You always think too much It is time for deeds.
Thinking ahead prevent mistakes.
Tell that to your sister.
It' s her fault that it came this far.
After the kidnapping Kitano will take us into his group.
It will be a massacre.
Kitano will give us the chance to make up for our mistake.
This is our last chance. this time we wont let him down.
This is not the moment to be weak.
Why aren' t you there?
- We must talk.
You want to talk?
About what?
About Wong' s son?
- Dont do it.
There is another solution.
Logan will help us.
You do it your way, I do it mine.
Everything that will happen will be your fault.
Kien.
I must stop him.
I must warn someone.
Think about what I' ve said.
Wait for me.
I will come for you.
Trust me.
This is there hiding place.
After the first troubles I followed them.
They wont stop until it' s settled.
Hey you, do you remember us?
We' il get them later.
We dont have time now.
Dammit.
You only had to block the road.
- Yeah, I went a bit too far.
Run!
Yaguy, you blew it.
We have to go.
We' il see eachother upstairs.
This way.
You wont get me.
What are you doing here?
You started it We just hit back.
It was a big mistake to come here.
This will cost you.
You talk too much.
If you really wanted to kill me, you would have done it a long time ago.
Let' s get out of here.
We should never have trusted you.
You are no better than your sister.
The Yakuza and the triads will take a bet on who is going to kill us first.
From now on it' s each on his own.
We have no alternative.
The sister of Kien is here.
Kitano had ordered her to steal your family seal... and kidnap your son tonight.
With this you will not erase the insult towards me.
But perhaps it will save your life and the live of your son.
Do you think we are that weak?
- In a war no one is save.
Even you.
I dont want to see you in this city anymore.
But before you disappear you have to do something for me.
Mae, I put someone on.
She' s going to tell you something about your husband.
Yes.
Still nothing?
- Still nothing.
Mae just left.
I dont know where to.
I' m sorry... my friend.
You can go.
What happens next... only concerns me.
Kien and Tsu have betrayed us.
With the french they want to prevent the kidnapping.
Dammit.
I cannot abandon him.
Kien?
Did you deal with your ghosts?
- We have to leave here.
You have found her.
Where are they coming from?
Logan.
Our new master wants me to let you live.
For now.
No.
He appreciates your worthy help.
But the Yakuza tolerate no traitors.
Go and see if everything is ready.
I' m sorry.
My friends are in danger.
I' ve to go.
The road to them brings you closer to your grandfather.
You are always welcome here, Son of the Wind.
Why did you follow us that evening?
What did you do to my friend?
Why do you care?
- It' s your fault.
You owe me an explanation.
Dat mag je niet zeggen.
- Are you going to hit me, like your brother?
He only wanted to help you and now he' s dead.
Master, it' s him.
Your sister and her friend are impatient.
And we got one of the french.
Where and when?
- Twelve o' clock at the industrial grounds.
If the door opens I' il kill you.
Where are you going?
If you leave from the wind, you will leave from the life.
Dont be afraid.
Let the wind take you to us.
Hold on.
How are you feeling?
What happened?
- Logan, where is Kenjee?
That' s not where he came for
It' s true.
Now we are even.
They have my sister and your friend.
Who is he talking about?
- The Yakuza
By attacking us you have messed with their plan.
Now they want your life and mine.
Do what you want, but I' m going with him
Not all of us will not return alive.
So dont feel obligated to come.
We are in this together.
They are in the west wing.
And you?
- I have a meeting.
Where is she?
- Safe.
For now.
What did you expect?
Where is the other?
You are brave.
- No.
Friends will take care of her.
Kenjee, everything okay?
No.
What' s wrong?
He' s happy to see you.
You' ve betrayed the love of my daughter...
Now you must face the consequences.
I' m glad you are here.
You have insulted us and you will pay.
We have come here to defend our honour.
If you kill him, you will become one of us, Kien
That' s what you wanted, isn' t it?
Here' s the exit.
Wait a second.
We' re not going to leave her brother.
Dont do it or you will become like them.
Master.
- It' s over.
There are too many of them.
I hope they will spare you.
Tell my wife I love her.
In a few minutes the police will come.
That' s enough time for you to follow your master in shame and blood.
Our master showed us the road.
If we sacrifice our blood in battle, we wipe his honour clean.
Prepare for battle.
Do we Fight or run?
- Fight.
Over the roofs.
- No.
Armed men are everywhere there.
you must conquer the security of your victory without fearing the defeat.
As long as you fight with dignity, you win.
You dont fight against others, but against yourself unite both our arts and control your violent temper.
Then the road will open itself for you.
No.
Come.
No.
Do you realize what we just did?
Imagine yourself.
Yaguy, We were almost dead Let it decant for a bit.
Stay.
Do it for me.
- I can' t.
Men, from now on, we stay together We stay together, hè?
You must live your life and I live mine.
You have always said:
We never change.
Run, you will never get him.
I' ve had a dream.
The wind floated me to you.
Do you remember?
Hey love birds, What' s up with that meeting?
Which meeting?
- Be patient.

Tell me you' re the man in charge, that' il be your responsibility.
You understand?
Fuck you.
Don' t try and play me.

Nobody wants to hear guns go off in there,
All right, I believe you,
- You understand?

Earlier today, a police officer was shot and killed while in...
Hey, How you doing?
It' s me,
You guys almost home?
Actually, we' re still at your place.
After you left, Amanda and I, we had another fight,
She turned on the TV.
We' ve been watching it all.
Well...
I turned it over to County, so I' m not there anymore,
Look, I know you' re busy, but can you stop by for a little bit?
I think I can, yeah,
I have to go by Carol' s,
She had a kid,
It' s not your fault she' s dead, Jeff.
You know?
Yeah,

She' s afraid we' re gonna get divorced,
What do you think, Jane?
You think we' re gonna get divorced?
- No.
- Good, Me neither,
- So, I' il see you in a minute, - OK.
- Say hi to Amanda, - I will.
- OK, - I love you.
Drive,
I know you' re scared, but as long as you don' t do anything stupid, we' re not gonna hurt you, Do you understand?
What do you want?
I want you to put your hands on the roof of the car,
Pardon me,
Now, would you mind putting your left hand through the steering wheel, please?
Now bring me the right,
Good,
Good,
Now the guy behind you is gonna take hold of you,
Don' t struggle, It' s for your own good, Please,
Eyes in the rearview mirror, Now,

But at least they' re still alive,
From this point on, you control what happens to them,
Can we let you go?
Can you be calm?
Good, Good,
Now, listen to me, I want you to go back to Walter Smith' s house,
There' s a DVD inside Walter Smith' s house that belongs to me,
You are going to reassume command until my people arrive to finish the job,
You' re not gonna let anyone go into the house or anything come out,
Are you with me so far?
How am I gonna do that?
You... are the famous Jeff Talley,
Ten years SWAT, seven years prime hostage negotiator,
You' il figure it out,
When this white phone rings, it' il be me with further instructions,
I will kill your wife,
And then I will kill your child,
But when I have what I want, you get your family back,
Here,
Now, you wait until our van is gone before you uncuff yourself,
Let' s bring this home, Talley,
- Yeah?
- We have a boy on the line.
And he says he' s Tommy Smith.
I was gonna turn him over to the Sheriff' s, but he says he saw you on TV and he wants to speak with you,
- All right, Louise.
Put him on.
- You' re the man on TV?
- Yes, Tommy, this is the man on TV,
Slow down, slow down, slow down, Slow down, Tommy, Slow down,
I' m really, really scared, and you gotta help us.
Slow down and take it easy,
Was your dad shot?
Dennis hit him a bunch of times with his gun.
- Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!
- He needs a doctor.
- Try and talk quietly, OK?
- Just take it easy, - OK.
All right, Are you in a safe place?
I' m in my bedroom.
They think I' m tied up, but I got free.
Wait, Tommy, How do you know they can' t hear you?
'Cause I can see them on the security channel.
Tell me everything you can see on the TV,
I see Dennis,
I see Kevin,
I see trees,
I see army men.
I see... the Mars guy...
Wait, Tommy.
Tell me about Mars,
- Captain Shoemaker?
- Get me an aerial shot ASAP,
This is Shoemaker,
They' re watching you on the outside cameras.
Chief Talley?
The suspects inside the house are watching you,
- They' re watching every move you make, - Where did you get this information?
If I were you I' d be thinking about what to do with that information,
Mikey, Yeah, it' s me, Listen to me,
Yeah, Chief,
Yeah, the snipers are shifting positions,
Louise, come back,
- Come on, Louise, Where' s that patch?
- I' m locked out.
It' s a dedicated line, Chief, They won' t let me cut in,
Did you get that?
Uh... yes.
Yes, I got it.
- OK, go, - It' s 805- 459...
I' m hearing your dad' s a real son of a bitch,
No, we' re fucking done, OK?
All I want is my fucking helicopter to fly me the fuck out of here,
You got that, fuckhead?
Dennis, listen, I...
This is Walter Smith.
You' ve reached my voice mail.
- Shit, - Please leave a message.
Come on, Dennis, Pick it up, Come on,
He keeps ringing,
- Hello?
- Dennis, this is Jeff Talley.
Listen to me, Watch the security channel,
Dennis, can you hear me?
Yeah, I don' t really know what you' re talking about,
The hell you don' t!
Shut up and listen to me!
Just watch the TV.
Just keep watching the outside cameras.
- Shut up!
Get your ass on the floor and watch the outside cameras, Dennis,
I' m watching,
What?
What are they doing?
- Talk to me, Dennis.
- Yeah, Yeah, I' m here, - Listen to me.
Listen to me carefully.
The Sheriff' s playbook is to make you dead.
First they' re gonna shoot out those cameras, and then they' re gonna shoot you.
- What are you talking about?
- I' m trying to save your life!
- Shut up!
I' m trying to save your life.
But you said you weren' t the guy,
I am the guy, Dennis,
I am the guy.
TAC sergeant, pull your people back 50 yards,
Hold it, You turned authority of this situation over,
I' m reassuming command, What are you waiting for?
Disregard, You don' t give orders to my men,
Now, ten minutes ago you called and told me to shoot out the cameras, Now...
You shot out the cameras?
I give you great intel like that and you just piss it away?
Way to go, big time,
I am not gonna let you step back in after you stepped out,
- This is my town, - Captain Shoemaker!
I invited you into my jurisdiction,
Dennis says he doesn' t trust me anymore,
Says he' s gonna shoot a hostage if he doesn' t talk to Talley, right now,
The name of the shooter in the house is Mars,
You' re gonna want to run that through your database,
Your next question is:
How did I get that information?
The little boy in the house called me on his sister' s cell phone,
Chief?
You OK?
Go on back up top, kid,
Hey, Dennis, it' s Jeff, Everybody OK in there?
- We' re buggin 'in here, man, - I know.
I' m trying to help.
Dennis, I really need to talk to Walter Smith,
Smith' s not talking,
Is Smith not talking because you won' t let him?
- Or is he not talking because he can' t?
- It' s not my fault.
I' ve hit people harder and they haven' t fallen!
I understand.
You' re under a lot of pressure in there,
But come on, man, I just saved your life, and you know it,
All I' m asking is that you help me save his life,
Come on,
He wants me to give up the old man,
Yeah, Yeah,
- It' s your spin, - Yeah, Good idea,
It' s not a wise move, We don' t have enough information,
Look, I want to help,
But I am not gonna let you do something that draws fire on my men,
You want to help me?
Turn the lights off,
Get the bird out of here,
Please,
Mikey, I' m behind the command post, Come on up here, will you?
I' m for breaking all the rules - but one,
Now, Dennis already broke it off with me, If you get shot, we are all...
I' m trying to save a life, Wil,
Yeah, Chief?
- Who we got on EMTs, Mike?
- There' s, like, seven units,
- Names, Mikey, Names, - OK, Uh...
There' s Hoffman, there' s Latona, Ridley, Jackson...
Ridley, Get Ridley up here, Tell him to strip,
- OK, - You too,
Wait...
- Me too what?
- Strip, You' re driving,
Sniper one to Control, Ambulance is 20 yards from the gate,
No activity.
He' s MOl, Let' s load and go,
- OK, On three, Ready?
- Yeah,
One, two...
Bang,
Go, Mikey, go,
- Mike, stop right here, - What, Chief?
Stop the goddamn ambulance!
- Everybody OK?
- Jeff, what are you doing?
- We' re gonna wake him up, - What?
We' re gonna wake him up, and you' re gonna do it,
He' s fixed and dilated, He could have brain damage, for all I know,
- Wake up, Smith,
- What the hell are you doing?
You want me to write this up?
- I' il put this in the report...
- Goddammit!
Give him the smelling salts, Give him a shot of epinephrine,
I need him for one minute, I gotta ask him one question,
He can' t answer you!
Then just give him the drugs,
I am not gonna give this man a shot,
Jeff, Jeff!
Get your gun, then, Get your gun and pull the trigger,
- Goddammit, I need your help!
- Do you want to kill him?
Go ahead, kill him, Come on, Come on, That what you want?
I want your help, Bob,
No, Jeff, No,
What you' re doing can kill this man,
What you' ve been seeing is footage taken only minutes ago.
We' re not yet sure exactly who the rescued hostage is, but it appears to be an adult male.
If our sources are correct, it could be Walter Smith, owner of the home...
Smith is on his way to the hospital,
Smith worries me.
He knows his place in the food chain, He' il be good,
And so do we.
If we don' t deliver that DVD, we' re going to need the accountant alive.
Now get somebody over there and make sure we don' t lose him,
Triage,
Someone at the information booth is asking for Walter Smith,
Hello?
I need to ask if you' re a member of the Smith family,
I' m sorry, but I' m only permitted to inform you that Mr, Smith was deceased on arrival, and that all other inquiries must be made tomorrow morning through the county coroner' s office,
If you' d like, I could give you the...
Hello?
- You good?
- Hell, no, I' m not good, Jeff,
The man needs a hospital, Damn, man, what the hell' s going on?
It' s not just his life you' re saving,
Stay off the radio, You want to get in touch with me, call me on my cell phone,
- What?
- Did I not say nobody was to go in or out of the house?
Now Smith is dead.
What do you care if Smith' s dead?
Dumb fuck.
You wait for my people or I will cut your daughter' s heart out.
Fuck you,
Go ahead, Kill my family,
Kill me,
I' m gonna box up all that dead motherfucker' s DVDs, and you and the feds can bid on 'em on eBay,
How' s that, smart fuck?
I guess we still need each other, don' t we?
I guess we do,
This isn' t Los Angeles, Jeffrey.
You don' t want another dead child on your conscience.
Now we' re almost home, you and me.
So keep your shit together.
Yeah,
You too,
Fuck,
Hey, We take the Benjamins, we use the rope, we climb up over the rock,
That' s so stupid, They got helicopters, They got night vision and shit,
Don' t be a dumb- ass, We' re not gonna walk out the front door,
How you gonna get the Benjamins up the rock?
You' ve done nothing!
Do something!
Are you crazy?
Then do anything, Anything!
Do something, Kevin, Huh?
Something,
I want to hear your plan, Please, tell me your plan, Please,
- Burn it, - What?
The house, We burn it,
Lots of smoke, Helicopters can' t see through smoke,
What about the brother and sister?
Huh?
What about the brother and sister?
You' re not killing any more people,
Classic foster product, At three years old, Marshall Krupcheck witnesses daddy kill mommy, then sees daddy kill himself,
You can guess the rest, Look at this,
He was only 17 at the time,
The clerk, he' s trying to say something,
- He' s saying, "Help me," - Yeah,
Why is he just standing there?
He' s not just standing there,
He' s watching him die,
We' re talking to the wrong guy,
It sucks your mom died,
She just walked out on my old man,
And he just, like... died,
He died of a broken heart,
I know you' re scared,
But I' m scared too,
You want some?
What' s the best day of your life?
Mine' s today,
That' s my girl,
That' s my girl,
- Go, Louise, - It' s Tommy Smith again.
Yeah, put him on,
Tommy, you' re talking to Chief Talley.
Hey, Tommy, How you doing, buddy?
- OK.
- Where are you?
- I' m in my secret place.
- Where' s your secret place, Tommy?
It' s kind of like this tunnel place.
- Got plans on the house yet?
Tommy, listen to me, buddy,
What exactly is in your secret place?
Has it got, like, pipes and wires running through it?
- Yeah, - He' s in the crawlspace,
Where does your secret space lead to, Tommy?
Like, everywhere,
- Chief Talley?
- Yeah, I' m still here, Tommy,
Dennis... he found my daddy' s Benjamins,
What' s a Benjamin?
A Benjamin is a hundred- dollar bill, Tommy,
How many Benjamins does your daddy have?
Two big bags,
- Yeah, Tommy?
Is my daddy gonna be OK?
Yeah, son, A good friend of mine is watching over him,
Tommy, I need you to go back to your room right now, OK?
OK,
Did you turn your sister' s cell phone on vibrate like I told you?
- Yeah.
- Good boy,
Wait for me to call you back, OK?
- OK, - All right.
- I gotta get better plans to this house, - s
Where' s Shoemaker?
- Yeah, - It' s about Walter Smith.
- What happened?
- He' s awake.
- I gave him the shot, - OK.
Thanks.
Mr, Smith, my name is Jeff Talley,
I' m the chief of police here in Bristo Camino,
I' ve been talking to your son, Tommy,
He' s still inside the house, along with his sister Jennifer,
I know you know the kind of young men they' re dealing with,
I need that DVD, Mr, Smith,
You know what I' m talking about,
You save my children,
Of course I want to save your family,
But the only way I can do it is if I get that DVD,
Heaven Can Wait.
Where is it?
Office.
- You OK, buddy?
- Yeah, I' m fine,
Good.
Tommy, I have to ask you a grown- up question now, OK?
OK,
I guess so, But my daddy says I' m never ever supposed to go in there,
Shh, Keep your voice down, buddy,
Keep your voice down, Remember?
OK.
OK.
- Tommy, do you like to play video games?
- Yeah,
What kind of games do you play?
I like Monster Jam, I play Bounty Hunter, I play Wubba Zorg...
Wubba Zorg, I know Wubba Zorg,
I know that game,
That means you know who Agent Zero is, right?
Yeah.
What do you think Agent Zero would do right now?
Do you think he would say "never ever," Tommy?
No, he wouldn' t say "never,"
Agent Zero would help Captain Wubba save Planet Xenon,
Are you like Captain Wubba?
And my house is Planet Xenon.
And Captain Wubba' s gonna save Planet Xenon,
Yeah, Tommy,
Captain Wubba' s gonna save Planet Xenon,
But I need your help.
Well, the most efficient entry point is here, The pool area,
Four- man team ropes in, Silent entry through one of the skylights here,
All right,
I put the doer and the two boys here in the courtyard, I keep the two kids in the house,
- How much time you need for the play?
How are you gonna get all three suspects to this side of the house?
Well, we' re about to jump off that bridge, aren' t we?
- Yeah?
- What?
- You and I are gonna talk.
Make sure you' re alone.
Dennis?
What do you want?
You by yourself?
Yeah,
We got a problem, Dennis,
Oh, yeah?
Yeah,
Walter Smith just died,
Hear what I said?
Yeah,
I know Mars killed my cop, but Smith' s death is on you, man,
Things just got a lot more complicated, didn' t they, Dennis?
Not to mention the fact that helicopters are very expensive,
Gotta pay for the fuel, the pilot... chief of police,
You know what cops do when they retire, Dennis?
They play golf,
I don' t want to play golf, I hate fucking golf,
I want a house on the golf course,
I want that,
Walter Smith talked to me before he died,
I know about the money,
I don' t know shit about money, man, I don' t know shit about what you' re talking about,
I' m talking about a transaction,
You want a helicopter, I want a house on the golf course,
Fifty thousand,
Maybe you can negotiate with the sheriffs for that,
No, No!
No,
Shit,
Half,
I' il give you half, OK?
That' s, like... two million, OK?
Half is good,
All right, Sell it to your crew,
Jennifer and Tommy stay in the house,
The three of you down here in the courtyard,
I' il trade the helicopter for the cash,
How do I know the pilot' s not gonna shoot me?
Let me worry about the pilot,
You just make sure he gets that bag, understand?
Yeah,
Half an hour,
Wait.
I' m the one who did this, I' m the one who had the balls, I made the deal,
I' m getting us out, Kevin, What do you think I' m doing?
- You' re just making it worse, - Look, I always take care of you,
Bullshit,
That' s the way it is, Kevin, Always has been and always will be,
Always, OK?
What if they just want to get us outside just to shoot us?
They could have killed us, like, a million times, Kev,
But they didn' t, because Talley wants to get paid,
Yeah, Get paid and then shoot us,
We' re leaving,
Wait, Leaving where?
We' re going on a helicopter ride,
No, No, I don' t want to,
I' m not your girl,
I' m not going anywhere with you, I' m not leaving...
You' re my girl,
And my girl comes with me,
Red team ropes in, Upon entry, our packages should be here,
This indoor pool area, Any questions?
It' s all there!
- Two million, - OK, Let' s go,
Where' s...
What' s this?
This wasn' t what we discussed,
This wasn' t what we talked about,
Three people in the chopper, That' s all it can carry, Dennis,
I thought you were the man in charge, Isn' t that what you told me?
I am in charge!
- Prove it, - Mars, leave her!
Jenny and I aren' t going nowhere,
Dennis, The man that owns this house is a criminal,
So are his friends, This money belongs to them,
- They' il come after you and fuckin 'kill you,
You want more fucking money?
You just chose the wrong house on the wrong day,
- I' m not lying, - Bullshit,
The only thing I lied to you about was Smith,
He' s not dead, You didn' t kill anybody,
That means that you and your brother can still beat the hard shit,
Just walk out of here with me, Put those guns down and walk out now,
- Come on, don' t let him fuck this up, - Dennis, it' s fucked,
They' re gonna shoot us as soon as we get through the gate,
- Shoot him,
- What the fuck is that?
- I' m sorry, I' m sorry,
Shoot him!
- I' m gonna turn around, - You will not,
I' m gonna turn around and walk out of here,
- And I will call you on the phone, - Dennis, come on, Come on, Den,
- Dennis, Dennis, don' t,
- We can go, - Let him go,
- Fuck you, - Come on, Kevin, Come with me,
- Grab the bags, - Come on,
Get the goddamn bags, Get the bags!
God damn it, Dennis!
- Dennis...
- I am in charge,
Please, please, we need help!
Please help us!
No, please!
No, please!
No!
Stand down, Stand down,
Kids are in the house,
I fucking hate you.
I want to go,
I want to go,
- I' m your brother, - I said I' ve fucking had it,
I' m your brother!
So you gotta choose, Me or Mars,
I choose the money,
You choose the money?
- What do you think of that?
- Done?
Chief Talley,
The situation has clearly gotten away from you,
Your flagrant disregard for protocol has unnecessarily placed yourself and my officers in the line of fire,
You remain in command, there' s a probability of a negative outcome,
Jeff!
- No, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff,
You' ve just made it easier, Chief, You' re done, You' re finished,
The FBl' s here at the barricade and they' re asking for you.
Where' s Chief Talley?
Laura Shoemaker, Sheriff' s Department, I' m in command,
Are you Talley?
Walter Smith and his family are witnesses under federal protection,
Chief, the US government would like to thank you for your service and cooperation,
Chief, move, now,
Chief Talley is no longer in command here,
This is a federal matter now, ma' am,
Get in,
That would be the white phone,
- Yeah, - You' re almost home, Talley.
All you have to do is stay put and leave the rest to my men.
When they recover the DVD, you recover your family.
Counterfeit feds,
Must be very expensive,
Maybe they' re real, and maybe not.
The less you know, the better for you.
Don' t fucking touch me,
Look, when all this shit' s done, it' s just gonna be you and me again, OK, Kev?
And with this kind of cake...
I mean, rich people always got a way out, you know?
Come on, let me see how bad it is,
Kev,
God damn it, there are kids in that house,
Turn this into a smash- and- grab job and people are gonna get killed,
You have your instructions, I have mine, We' il leave it at that,
Come any closer to the house and your family is dead,
It' s over,
I' m taking them and going,
OK,
Go,
Shit!
Shit, Shit,
They shot him, They shot him,
I' m sorry, Kevin, I' m really sorry, I' m sorry, I' m sorry, I' m sorry,

- You did very good, You did really good,
Jennifer, come on, We have to leave right now,
Come on, Get that shower on in there, Go,
- Get the shower on, get some towels wet, - I found them,
Get 'em soaked, Tommy, come on, Come on,
- I' ve got your special movies, - Oh, my God,
You were very brave, But it' s not over, right?
Go help your sister, We' re still in trouble, all right?
Hurry, please,
Fuck!
Come on, come on, Get down,
Gun - down,
Turn around, slowly,
Nobody leaves till I get what I need,
Just let 'em get to the front door,
Just let 'em go,
Down, Get down!
Come on,
Thanks for everything, man, How bad?
You could be bleeding to death, we wouldn' t even know it,
You gotta get to a hospital, Jeff, Now,
No time,
Yeah?
Do you know how bad you have fucked this up?
Your family is dead!
- Shut up, - They are fucking dead.
- Fuck!
Talk, - It' s me,
This is Walter Smith,
Now what?
Look out the window,
I don' t even know who these people are,
Or what they do, I cook the books,
You know, set up shell companies, offshore accounts,
And then I would encrypt it onto a disk and leave it at the drop point,
I mean...
It was never face to face,
I want to see my family,
Jane?
Amanda?
It' s OK, baby,
We' re gonna be out of here in just a minute,
Now, only the famous Jeff Talley could come up with a rig like that,
And I see you' ve taken a bullet,
Walter, you' re looking fairly banged- up as well,
How do I know you still have what I need?
- Trinidad...
- Wait,
- Go ahead, - Trinidad Mercantile, Dominican Republic,
Michelangelo Sister Trust,
The account number' s Brenda 65007265,... 65,
- Shut up,
- Dutch Antilles...
- You' re good, - OK,
You can let 'em leave now, right?
Just let my family leave, Walk 'em to the door,
I leave with 'em, Smith stays here,
Everybody' s happy,
I haven' t seen your face,
I haven' t seen any of your faces!
I leave you alone, you leave me alone,
Is that what this is, Talley?
You' re gonna wear me down?
I' m just trying to bring us all home,
Cut Walter loose, Send him over next to me, and we will disappear into the day,
Let them go, I' il stay here, Just let them go,
You get this one thing:
I don' t bargain,
I give, You take, That' s it,
Cut him loose,
Good,
Hands, Hands up, in the air,
Oh, you' re a fucking dead man, You' re a fucking dead man!
Thank you very fucking much, He hasn' t seen your face?
- My family hasn' t seen his face,
- What are you waiting for?
- They didn' t see his face,
Come on,
Just let 'em go!
- Come on, what are you waiting for?
Just let 'em go now!
Goddammit, kill him!
She shivers in the wind like the last leaf on a dying tree.
I let her hear my footsteps.
She only goes stiff for a moment.
Care for a smoke?
Sure.
I' il take one.
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?
I didn' t come here for the party.
I came here for you.
I' ve watched you for days.
You' re everything a man could ever want.
I\ x9Ds just not your face.
Your... figure.
Or your voice.
It' s your eyes.
All the things I see in your eyes.
What is it you see in my eyes?
I see a crazy calm.
You' re sick of running.
You' re ready to face what you have to face.
But you don' t want to face it alone.
No.
I don' t want to face it alone.
The wind rises electric.
She' s soft and warm and almost weightless.
Her perfume is sweet promise that brings tears to my eyes.
I tell her that everything will be alright.
That I' il save her from whatever she' s scared of and take her far far away.
I tell her...
I love her.
The silencer makes a whisper of the gunshot.
I hold her close until she' s gone.
I' il never know what she' s running from.
I' il cash her check in the morning.
Just one hour to go.
My last day on the job.
Early retirement.
Not my idea.
Doctor' s orders.
Heart condition.
"Angina", he calls it.
I' m polishing my badge and getting myself used to the idea of saying "Goodbye" to it.
It and the 35 years of protecting and serving and tears and...... blood and terror, triumph that represents...
I' m thinking of Aileen' s slow smile...... about the thick fat steak she picked up at the butcher' s today.
I' m thinking about the one loose end I haven' t tied up.
A young girl who' s out there somewhere...... helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic...
Damnit, Hartigan.
I won' t let you do this, you' re going to get yourself killed.
You' re going to get us both killed.
I won' t let you.
I' m warning you.
Let go of my coat, Bob.
You' re draggin me down with you.
I' m your partner.
They can kill me too.
I ain' t putting up with that.
I' m getting on the horn and calling for backup.
Sure, Bob.
We' il just wait.
Sit on our ass while that sick Rourk brat gets his sick thrills with victim number four.
Victim number four.
Nancy Callahan, age 11.
And she' il be raped and slashed to ribbons...... and that backup that we' re waiting on...... will just so happen to show up just late enough...... for Rourk to get back to his U. S. Senator daddy...
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.
Settle down and think straight.
You' re pushing 60 and you got a bum ticker.
You ain' t saving anyone.
Got a great attitude, Bob.
Real credit to the force, you are.
Aileen' s home waiting for you.
Think about Aileen.
Heck, Bob.
Maybe you are right.
I' m glad to hear you' re finally talking sense.
Hell of way to end a partnership.
Hell of a way to start my retirement.
Nancy Callahan, age 11.
For all I know, she' s dead already.
You' ve been a very good, Nancy.
You' ve been very quiet.
Don' t be scared.
We' re going to be taking you home really soon.
But first, we' re going to introduce you to somebody.
He' s a very nice man.
Half way to the warehouse where Weevil said they took her and it hits.
Wicked spot of indigestion.
At least that' s what I pray it is.
I seek only the most lighthearted and momentary degression.
The briefest indulgement in automotive pleasure...... for cheap thrills.
Such shortlived durability, Mr. Shlubb.
You would risk engendering an ill will on the part of our employers.
Burt Shlubb and Douglass Klump.
Two any- job- there- is thugs with dellusions of eloquence.
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet...... temporarily remanded to our customer, though it may be...... remains the property of the son of Senator Rourk.
Got to keep this quiet.
Take them down fast.
A single dent, the mearest scratch, thereupon on the before...... mentioned consequences of which I so recently made mention...... shall surely be afford us.
Catch your breath.
Give your heart time to slow down.
But it won' t slow down.
Get over it.
She needs you.
We' re all done here, Benny.
Let' s give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.
Be with you in a minute, Lenny.
I' m just making sure they get along really well.
What kind of beast couldn' t get along with a precious little girl like this.
You must be awfully scared now.
But you got nothing to be scared of.
All we' re going to do is have a nice little talk.
That' s all.
Just a nice talk, just you and me.
Don' t you cry now.
Doctor said it' d be like this.
Just take the pill he gave you.
No need to play it quiet.
Not anymore.
Breath steady old man.
Prove you' re not completely useless.
What the hell.
Go out with a bang.
He likes to hear them scream.
I' ve seen his victims and their twisted little faces...... all wide- mouthed and bug- eyed...... frozen in their last horrible moment of living.
No screams.
Either I' m just in time or I' m way too late.
It' s nothing.
Barely a flesh wound.
On your feet, old man.
Rourk!
Give it up!
Let the girl go.
You can' t do a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan!
You know who I am!
You know who my father is!
You can' t touch me, you piece- of- shit cop.
Look at you.
You can' t even lift that cannon you' re carrying.
Sure I can!
Cover your eyes, Nancy.
I don' t want you watching this.
I mean it baby.
Cover your eyes right now.
I take his weapons away.
Both of them.
Hell of a way to end a partnership.
For God' s sakes, don' t make it any worse.
Don' t make me kill you.
I' m doing fine, Bob.
Never better.
Ready to kick your ass.
Keep it talking.
By time, just a few more minutes.
Just until backup gets here.
Sit down and stay down.
I' il kill you if I have to.
Keep his mind off the girl.
Skinny little Nancy.
Can' t kill her once the backup gets here.
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.
Hey.
Don' t listen to him, he' s a crazy man.
A tough man you are, huh?
You stay right where you' re at.
You shoot your partner in the back...... then you try to scare a little girl.
Later, I' il pull my spare rod.
Plug you a couple times.
Show you how it' s done.
We could' ve worked something out, but you' ve blown that.
Sit down or I' il blast you in half.
You' re so slow, you' il never stop me.
Sit down.
You' il never be able to stop me.
I finally sit down, just like you told me to.
The sirens are close now.
She' il be safe.
Things go dark.
I don' t mind much.
Getting sleepy.
It' s Ok.
She' il be safe.
An old man dies.
Little girl lives.
Fair trade.
The night is hot as hell.
It' s a lousy room in a lousy part of a lousy town.
I' m staring at a goddess.
She' s telling me she wants me.
I' m not going to waste one more second wondering how I' ve gotten so lucky.
I want you.
She smells like angels ought to smell.
The perfect woman.
The goddess.
I need you.
Goldie.
She says her name is Goldie.
There hours later and my head' s feeling several sizes too big...... and that cold thing happens to my stomach...... and I realize Goldie is dead.
Not a mark on her.
You' d have to check her pulse to notice those perfect breasts...... of hers aren' t moving like they would if she was breathing.
She was murdered and I was right here when it happened.
Lying next to her...... stone drunk, just like she was.
Damnit Goldie.
Who are you and who wanted you dead?
Who are you besides an angel of mercy giving a two- time loser like me the night of his life?
It sure wasn' t my looks.
So why the sleazy saloon.
Why the kindest Goldie.
The cops.
They' re telling me too much.
Showing up before anybody but me and the killer could know there' s been a murder.
Somebody paid good money for this frame.
No reason at all to play it quiet.
No reason to play it any way but my way.
Whoever killed you is going to pay, Goldie.
Open up.
Police!
I' il be right out.
I don' t know why you died, Goldie.
I don' t know why and I don' t know how.
I never even met you before tonight.
But you were a friend and more when I needed one.
And when I found out who did it...... it won' t be quick and quiet like it was with you.
It' il be loud and nasty.
My kind of kill.
And when his eyes go dead, the Hell I send him to will seem like Heaven after what I' ve done to him.
I love you Goldie.
Claire?
Don' t worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.
Got any beers around this place?
No way I' m giving you any alcohol.
Besides, it' s not what you came here for anyway, is it?
No.
Go ahead.
It work' s without them.
Thanks.
You' re the best.
Lucille' s my parole officer.
She' s a dyke, but God knows why.
With that body of her' s, she could have any man she wants.
The pills come from a girlfriend who' s a shrink.
She tried to analyze me once, but she got too scared.
Haven' t seen you like this in awhile.
Had a fight with some cops.
Didn' t happen to kill any of them, did you?
Not that I know of.
But they know they' ve been in a fight, that' s for damn sure.
How the hell do you suppose I' m going to square this with the board.
There ain' t no squaring it, not this time.
This isn' t some bar room brawl...... or some creep with a gas can trying to torch someone.
Hey hey, this is big.
Settle down, Marv.
Take another pill.
Hey, there isn' t no settling down.
This is blood for blood and by the gallons.
This is the old day, and the bad days, the all or nothing days.
They' re back.
There' s no choices left.
And I' m ready for war.
Prison was hell for you Marv.
It' s going to be life this time.
How' s waking up every goddamn day and not even knowing why you' re here.
But I' m out now.
It took somebody who was kind to me.
Getting killed to do it.
But I' m out.
I know exactly what I got to do.
So you were scared, weren' t you Goldie.
Somebody wanted you dead and you knew it.
So you hit the saloons, the bad places.
Looking for the biggest meanest lug around, and finding me.
Well I' m going to find that son of a bitch that killed you...... and I' m going to give him the hard good- bye.
Walk down the right back alley in sin city...... and you can find anything.
Serves your face.
Take off.
He' s new here, Marv.
He didn' t know.
Katie' s my kind of joint.
Nancy' s just getting started with her gig, but already the crowd' s breathing hard.
Plenty of nights I' ve drooled over Nancy...... shoulder to shoulder with all the other losers like me.
But that' s not what I' m looking for tonight.
What' il it be, Marv?
A shot and a brew, Shellie, and keep it coming.
Sure, honey.
You take it slow now.
Most people think Marv is crazy.
He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century.
He' d be right at home on some ancient battlefield, swinging an axe into somebody' s face.
Or in a Roman arena taking a sword to other Gladiators like him.
They' d have tossed him girls like Nancy back then.
Show' s over, dickwad.
Drink up.
Now that' s one fine- looking coat you' re wearing there.
You' re killing days are over, you over- the- hill do- gooder son of a bitch.
I love hitmen.
No matter what you do to them, you don' t feel bad.
Take it off.
What?
Fine coat like that, and you' re bleeding all over it.
Alright, it' s all yours.
Who was it you loosers who killed Goldie?
The guy who did that... he knew what he was doing.
So tell me, man, who sent you?
I don' t hear you giving me any names.
So I guess when I shot you in the belly, I aimed a little too high.
You keep holding out on me like this, and I' m going to have to get really nasty.
It' s Telly.
Telly Stern... passed me the order.
He runs the tables over at the Triple Ace Club.
Thanks again.
Now the damnedest thing happens.
For a second I smell the angel' s smell that belonged to my Goldie.
Just need my medicine is all.
Bastard.
You' re going to pay for what you did to me.
You like talking, Louie?
How many for the kill?
It was Connely.
He set me up.
He' il never talk.
I don' t know about you, but I' m having a ball.
Connely talks.
They all talk.
And what have been your sins, my son?
Well, Padre.
I don' t want to keep you up all night, so I' il just fill you in on the latest batch.
These here hands of mine, they got blood all over them.
You' re speaking... figuratively.
I need to find something out, I just go out and...... look for somebody that knows more than me and I go and I ask them.
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.
That way, for instance, in fact, I killed there men tonight...... tortured them first.
You might say I' ve been working my way up the food chain.
First two are minnows, small time messengers.
But it was Connely.
They money man who fingered you, Padre.
Dear Lord, Marv.
This is a House of God.
Just give me a damn name.
Roark.
You really are pushing your luck, Padre, feeding me garbage like that.
It can' t be that big.
There' s a farm out North Cross and Lennox.
It' s all there.
Find out for yourself.
While you' re at it, ask yourself.
If that corpse of a slut is worth dying for?
Worth dying for.
Worth killing for.
Worth going to hell for.
Amen.
These keys say the Padre drove a Mercedes.
Or at least that' s what they' re passing off as a Mercedes these days.
Modern cars They all look like electric shavers.
Goldie.
Goldie.
That couldn' t be Goldie.
It' s my own fault, and nobody else’ s, that I got confused.
I' ve been having so much fun I forgot to take my medicine.
That wasn' t Goldie back there.
Goldie' s dead.
And that' s the whole reason I' ve been doing what I' ve been doing.
When you got a condition, it' s bad to forget your medicine.
The cold thing, it creeps into my gut and tells me one more time it won' t let go.
This is a bad place, this farm.
People have died here.
The wrong way.
I don' t want to fight, pooch.
I got no gripe with you.
Easy boy.
No way I was going to use my gun on you, buddy.
It' s whoever owns you, I' m curious about.
Because there' s blood on your breath, and I think I know what kind.
So I sniff around to see what' s buried.
Here we go.
Impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me,
I go blind.
Not a sound.
Nobody' s that quiet!
Nobody except the one who snuck in that hotel room two nights ago.
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.
You killed Goldie.
It was...
I blew it, Goldie.
I found your killer, but he was better than me.
Too quiet.
Too quick.
A killer born.
Why didn' t he finish the job?
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.
Lucille?
It' s not just that wolf of his.
The wolfs just get scraps.
Bones.
It' s him.
He eats... people.
He cooks them like they were steaks.
Let' s get you warm.
Just like they were steaks.
Now he' s got both of us.
It' s alright.
Take a nice slow breath.
Just look at the heads on the wall.
Heads on the wall.
The heads on the...
Son of a bitch.
He kept smiling that damn smile...... made me watch him... suck the meat off my fingers.
He made me watch.
He made me watch!
Christ, I could use a cigarette.
Dames.
Sometimes all they got to do is let it out...... and a few buckets later, there' s no way you' d know.
You brought us some big trouble this time, Marv.
Whoever' s behind this little thing, has his connections right in the department.
Any leads?
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out that hooker almost before I did.
What hooker?
The one you' ve been obsessing over.
The dead one.
Goldie.
I didn' t know she was a hooker.
It doesn' t make any difference about anything.
But I didn' t know that.
She was high class stuff.
She must' ve shown you quite a time.
Wait.
There' s a car coming.
Kevin.
All I' ve got is a face... and a name.
I' il see you later, Kevin.
Let' s go.
They' ve done checking the house.
They' re coming this way.
Bastards, I' il show them.
You' re not going to get any of us killed, Marv.
No, don' t shoot.
Please, listen to me.
I' m his parole officer.
He' s unconscious and unarmed.
So there' s no need to kill him.
Captain.
The target.
There' s no sign of him.
Here' s a sign...
That there is one damn fine coat you' re wearing -
I keep coming back to that cop I just killed and what he told me.
I was pretty steamed about what he' d done to Lucille.
So I took my time with that son of a bitch.
It wasn' t until I showed him all those pieces of himself that he said... just a name.
Patrick Henry Roark.
Man of the cloth.
He could' ve become President, but he chose to serve God.
And along the way, he just happen to become the most powerful man of the State.
He' s brought down mayors and governors like they were nothing.
He even made his rotten brother a U. S. Senator without breaking a sweat.
And here he' s going to get killed in the name of a dead hooker.
I' m getting used to the idea.
More and more, I' m liking the sound of it.
Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.
What if I' m wrong?
I' ve got a condition.
I get confused sometimes.
And with Lucille dead, I can' t get my medicine.
What if I' ve imagined all of this.
What if finally turn into what they' ve always said I was going to turn into.
A maniac.
A psychokiller.
Can' t kill a man without knowing for sure you ought to.
I' ve got to know for sure.
The merchandise is on display, by the time I make my way to Old Town.
For an hour or so, I ask around about Goldie.
I don' t get any answers, but I know I' m bound to.
Lucille said Goldie was a hooker.
And if she was, she has roots here.
Friends, maybe even family.
You can' t be Goldie.
Goldie' s dead.
Goldie.
Yeah, sure, right.
I haven' t eaten anything or taken my medicine for days now.
No wonder I' m seeing things.
Bastard.
He' s crazy.
Hit him again, Wendy... harder.
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendie?
Because that' s my name, you ape.
Goldie was my sister.
My twin sister.
I guess she was the nice one.
Goldie and the other six.
Where are they?
What did you do to them?
You crazy goddamn broad.
Just take a look at this mug.
Would any of you dames let me get close enough to you to kill you?
None of you would.
But Goldie.
And only she did because she thought I could protect her.
And I' il bet those cops didn' t do a damn thing about those other girls tonight.
But as soon as they hit me for a fall guy, they showed up, guns blazing.
But they didn' t get me.
And I' ve been killing my way to the truth ever since.
So go ahead doll... shoot me now.
Or get the hell out my way.
Nuts.
Ok, I better be getting all that sorted out.
What the hell?
I tied those knots.
That' s my specialty...
You sat there and took it, when you could' ve taken my gun away from me anytime you wanted to.
Well, sure.
I thought I might be able to talk some sense into you.
And I probably would' ve had to paste you one.
And I don' t hurt girls.
We need a pair of handcuffs.
What style you want?
I got a collection.
Just give him the ones you got with you, Gail.
It was a farmboy named Kevin who killed Goldie.
But it was Cardinal Roark who was behind him and I don' t know why.
I know that sounds crazy.
No it doesn' t.
Goldie worked the Clergy.
Just like that, a whopper of a puzzle piece falls smack in my lap.
I' m too dumb to put the whole picture together yet, but...... she fires up two cigarettes and hands me one and I taste her lipstick on it...... and suddenly my heart' s pounding so loud I can' t hear anything else.
I wanna reach over and touch her and taste Goldie' s sweat one more time...... but she isn' t Goldie.
Yeah, yeah, this' il do.
I' m also going to be needing a dozen two- foot lengths of...... this rubber tubing.
And a spool of razor wire.
A pair of those special gloves that' il...
let me handle the wire.
Beefing up the old home security, huh?
You bet your ass.
She was my sister.
So I' m in this one to the end.
But why are you willing to go up against Roark for someone you barely know.
She was nice to me.
Gave me something I didn' t even know existed.
I wasn' t never even able to... buy a woman.
Yeah, the way I look.
I take my mind off her and I crawl back inside myself.
It' s almost killing time, and I better get sharp.
I check the list.
Rubber tubing.
Gas.
Saw.
Gloves.
Cuffs.
Razor wire.
Hatchet.
Gladys.
And my mitts.
We' re close enough.
Pull over.
Yes, Marv.
Keep the engine running.
If I' m not back in 20 minutes, you get the hell out of here.
Don' t look back.
Kill him for me, Marv.
Kill him good.
I won' t let you down.
Heading downstairs to the kitchen.
Getting himself a midnight snack.
And I can guess what kind.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Damn, he' s slick!
Is that the best you can do, creep?
That' s right.
Get personal, get close.
I can take it.
I got you, you little bastard.
Let' s see you hop around now.
I try to slow my heart down and breath the fire out of my lungs.
My muscles make me a 1, 000 promises of pain to come.
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister, let me finish him.
You wasn' t supposed to come down here, Wendy.
Oh, but I wanted to ki...
I' m sorry kid, but I haven' t even started with this creep...... and I don' t want you watching the rest...... it' il give you nightmares.
God, I got to tell you, I' m good and bushed.
It' s not that fight of our that did me in either.
It' s all that sawing and tying.
It' s not as easy as it looks.
It could' ve been a real mess around here if I didn' t have that tubing for... turniquettes.
I got to admit...... there was a spurt or two.
You get the scent in the air.
To get that friend of yours to come running.
Well, what do you know.
Look who' s here.
Here he comes.
That' s a good dog.
He doesn' t scream.
Not even when the mutt' s had its fill...... and Kevin' s guts are lying all over the place...... but somehow the bastard is still alive, still staring at me...
Not even when I grab the saw and finish the job.
He never screams.
I put in a call to Katie' s and ask Nancy to get her clothes on and meet me at her place.
She say' s "Yes" like always.
Hey, Nancy.
You got any beers?
Sure, Marv.
Who' s the babe?
There isn' t much of anything Nancy wouldn' t do for me...... not since a year back when her frat boy roughed her up and I straightened him out but good.
It really gets my goat when guys rough up dames.
So what do you want me to do with her?
Well, your best bet is... drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.
What about you?
Are you leaving town?
Hell no.
I like it here.
I hotwire a parked cab and stay under the speed limit so as not to get any attention.
My head starts to clear, and things start to make sense.
I owe you, Goldie.
I owe you one, and I' m going to pay up.
So going after Roark means dying, win, or lose?
Hell, I' il die laughing if I know I' ve done this one thing right.
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.
Alright, keep a lookout.
Kevin?
What' s left of him, anyways.
The dog ate the rest.
Oh, my God.
You monster.
You... demon.
Don' t scream of I' il plug you.
He had the voice... of an angel.
Yet he spoke only to me.
And he' s dead now because of one stupid whore.
It' s not a real good idea for you to talk about Goldie that way... while I' m around.
When he came to me.
He was a tormented boy.
Tormented by guilt.
I tried to council him.
But the eating.
It filled him with white light.
Tearful, he swore to me that he felt the touch of God almighty.
What the hell do you know?
I know it' s pretty damn weird to eat people.
He didn' t just eat their bodies.
He ate their souls.
And I joined in.
They were all whores.
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody' d miss them.
And then your...
Goldie almost ruined everything.
She stayed in public places.
And then with you.
You were so convenient.
You' d broken man' s jaw that very night.
Who would believe a thug like you?
Kevin killed her.
I ordered the police in for you.
But you wouldn' t be caught.
You wouldn' t stop.
And now he' s dead and you' re here too.
Eliminate me.
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?
Killing a helpless, old fart.
The killing, no.
No satisfaction.
Everything up until the killing... will be a gas.
Kevin.
We' re going home.
You could scream now if you want to.
It' s beautiful, Goldie.
It' s just like I promised, only better.
And when his eyes go dead, the Hell I send him to must seem like Heaven after what I' ve done to him...
Freeze!
Oh my God!
Jerks.
They should' ve shot me in the head, and enough times to make sure.
It' s so stupid.
Everybody knows what' s coming...... but they go through the motions anyway, what a waste of time.
Month' s fall off the calendar while I breath and eat through tubes.
Night after night I wait for someone to come and finish me off.
After awhile I realize it' s not going to be so easy as that.
I' m on my feet for about ten minutes before the cops kick them out from under me.
They don' t ask me any questions.
They just keep knocking the crap out of me and waving a confession in my face...... and I keep spitting blood all over it and laughing at how many fresh copies they come up with...... then along comes this worm assistant district attorney who turns the recorder off and says...... if I don' t sign their confession, they' il kill my mom.
I break his arm in there places and I sign it.
From then on, it' s the circus everybody wants it to be.
They nail me for the works.
Not just the people I did kill...... but even Lucille and the girls that Roark and Kevin ate...... and even Goldie.
The judge is all fire and brimstone when she hands down the sentence...... midnight and my death are only a few hours away, when I get my first surprise in 18 months.
My only visitor.
I' m ready for anything but that scent.
I got him for you good, didn' t I, Goldie.
I' m sorry, Wendy.
I got confused again...... seeing you like this.
You can call me Goldie.
She smells like angels ought to smell.
The perfect woman.
The goddess.
Goldie.
She says her name is Goldie.
They fix me a pretty decent steak for my last meal.
They even throw in a brew.
It' s the first I' ve had since back at Nancy' s.
Then they shave my head and fix me with a rubber diaper.
And get to it.
And it' s about damn time, if you ask me.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
Would you get a move on, I haven' t got all night.
You heard the man.
Hit it.
That the best you can do, you pansies?
He' s done.
The Big Fat Kill.
Forget it, man.
You can bang on that door all night if you want to.
There is no way in Hell I' m letting you in.
I can' t believe you' re doing this to me, Shellie.
Everything we' ve shared.
It has to mean something to you.
It meant plenty.
Plenty of lost pay on account on how nobody wants to...... flirt with a waitress whose face is all purple and swollen up with bruises.
I know you' re angry, baby.
And I forgive you for that without you even asking me to.
That hurts, Shellie.
It' s one thing for you to play hard to get...... but don' t go trying to cut my nuts off.
I... am impossible to get.
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy, and get help...... like... a shrink.
Get help and... get lost.
Just open the door.
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I' il take care of this.
Just open the door.
Oblige him, Shellie.
I' m ready for him.
No.
If he knew that you were here with me, you don' t know how bad this can get.
This clown' s got a big mean drunk on.
And he' s got four friends out there in the hall, breathing had and just as drunk as he is...
I could swear I heard somebody in there with you just now.
Somebody?!
Jackie Boy, it' s a regular African lovefest in here.
Im no rasist.
I mean, I got me, I got me all five starters...... and half the bench of the Basin City Blues keeping me company.
You feel like taking them on?
You are teasing me, baby.
Some of my best friends...... but you are really pushing my buttons...... and the whole time you' ve been doing me like this.
I' ve been too polite to point out that at any time I want to.
I could kick this damn door to splinters.
Ok, baby You know what I can do.
You know what I can do...
Alright, Jack.
One...
Alright.
Two...
Alright, alright...
Troops, make yourself at home.
You brought your whole pack with you?
None of these bozos got lives, they got to hang out with you.
You' re going to love this baby.
You' re going to call up some of your friends...... who work in the saloon.
With you and the bunch of us, we' re going to...... hit every joint in town.
It' s just going to be great.
I ain' t calling up nobody.
That' s a man' s shirt, and I sure as Hell it ain' t one of mine.
You got somebody' s slow stink all over you.
You' ve been with another man.
You' ve been with him tonight.
He' s Superman.
He flew out the window just as soon as he heard you were coming...... because you scared him so bad.
You think I have no feelings at all.
If you' re going to slug me, just go ahead and get it over with, you sick bastard.
There you go, lying about me again, right in front of my friends.
I have never hit a woman in my life.
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.
Baby, we' re all here to have a good time.
Got to take a leak.
Wish you dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy.
Then you could' ve met my boyfriend.
Could' ve seen what a real man looks like.
There you go.
After my nuts again.
But I forgive you.
I' m a generous guy.
He is generous.
With temper of his, you never should' ve picked on him like you did.
You don' t have to.
You don' t have to worry about it.
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself or I' il cut your little pecker off.
I' ve been told.
Hey, baby.
I don' t hear you making those calls.
Answer me.
Oh, I don' t need this grief.
Hi, I' m Shellie' s new boyfriend and I' m out of my mind.
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again, you even think her name, and I' il cut you in ways that' il make you useless to a woman.
You' re making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake yourself.
You didn' t flush.
Troops.
Get out of here.
No questions, damnit, no questions.
Now!
Dwight, what in the Devil did you do to him?
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine.
I don' t think he' il be bothering you again.
How' s your jaw?
I' ve been slapped around worse.
Dwight?
He was from awhile back...... before you showed up again with that new face of yours...... and... it was only because I felt sorry for him.
It was only once.
I' ve done some dumb things.
Seeing as how I' m one of those dumb things, I can' t give you too hard a time about that, Shellie.
But this guy.
He' s a menace.
He might kill somebody if I don' t stop him.
I' il call you later.
No, don' t go!
Shellie shouts something I can' t quite make out over the racket of a passing police copter.
It sounds like "Stop".
But I can' t be sure.
It' s a chance I shouldn' t be taking.
But I can' t just go home and forget about it and let Jackie Boy and his pals have their fun.
They' re a pack of predators, and they' re out for blood tonight.
A woman' s blood.
Damnit, Dwight, damnit.
You fool.
You damn fool...
I cut Caddy across the car to pick up Jackie Boy heading like a bat out of hell up the hill...
I' m speeding.
That' s a good way to get yourself noticed...... and if you' re a murderer with a new face whose are fingerprint check away to the fast track to the gas chamber, like I am...... the last thing you want is to get noticed.
I don' t have nearly enough cash on me to bribe this cop...... and even if I did, there' s always the outside chance he' s one of the honest ones.
Do I try to talk my way out of this?
Or do I take this cop down and risk it all?
Then Jackie Boy saves me a great big streaming pile of trouble.
Watch it Jack!
Cops.
They' re right on our ass.
Not for long.
Not where we' re headed.
My gut tightens up.
Jackie Boy' s leading us straight to Old Town.
The cop shuts off his siren.
He knows he' s not the law.
Not in Old Town.
The ladies are the law here.
Beautiful and merciless.
If you got the cash and play by the rules, they' il make all your dreams come true.
But if you cross them, you' re a corpse.
Hop in, sugar.
We' il get you there.
Aww, sweetheart.
I work the dayshift, and it' s been a long day.
Besides, I don' t do group jobs.
Get in the car, baby.
We' il just talk.
It' il be nice.
I don' t do talk jobs, either.
Baby doll, I' ve had me one hell of a bad day.
I' ve been beat up every time I turn around.
But then day when I get turned down by a hooker.
When I got good hard earned cash to pay with.
Well?
There' s only so much a man can take.
Go try the Alamo over on Dillan Street.
That' s the Alamo, not the Amigo.
The Amigo' s a fag joint.
Are you having a good time?
Humiliating me like this for no damn reason at all?
That' s far enough, Dwight.
We' ve been on top of these peckerwoods since they first showed up with that cop behind them.
Everything' s under control.
Enjoy the show.
There' s no use arguing with her.
The ladies are their own enforcers.
So how' s the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up.
Not right now, Gail.
Oooh, wound up a little tight, aren' t we?
That' s your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.
That and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.
Damnit, Gail.
Not right now.
Those clowns, down the way.
They some of the barmaids' boyfriends?
One of them thinks he is.
He' s out of control.
I followed them here to make sure he didn' t hurt any of the girls.
Us helpless, little girls.
All kinds of death is about to hit less than 20 yards ahead of us.
And still it' s hard to take my eyes off her.
Us girls are as safe as can be, Lancelot.
Those boys in that Chrystler are one mistake away...... from seeing what Miho can do.
And she' s been aching for some practice.
She guards my glance upward to the pixie perched on the roofs edge.
Deadly Little Miho.
You' re running out of valley, cowboy.
Turn around.
Safe yourself and your buddies a ton of grief.
You' re a sassy little thing.
You ain' t hardly in any kind of position to be making threats.
The trap is set.
Locked and ready to spring.
So what?
They' re scum.
They deserve what' s coming.
So why this rotten feeling in my gut that something is awfully wrong?
They haven' t killed anybody I don' t know about.
They got pretty bad at Shellie' s place...... but they didn' t kill anybody.
And they won' t.
Why this rotten feeling?
Something Shellie said.
I can' t place it.
Ok, Ok, Ok, I sounded off a little more than I should' ve.
I' m a little edge.
Over the edge.
It' s not a woman you need, it' s a good night sleep.
You couldn' t handle a woman in the state you' re in.
She saying you don' t got what it takes, Jack.
You want to see it?
You want to see what I got?
Huh?
I' ve seen all shapes, all sizes.
Have you seen this one?
Get in the car.
Oh, sugar.
You just gone and done the dumbest thing in your whole life.
Oh, God, no.
This is crazy.
I don' t know where... for no reason at all.
Go ahead... go ahead.
He' s got the drop on her.
He' s got squat.
He' s dead, he' s just too dumb to know it.
I got you... right where I want you.
This is a career ending wound for.
There' s going to be hell to pay.
Watch your step, Jackie Boy...
Yeesh.
This isn' t funny!
Don' t anyone laugh.
I got friends you can' t imagine!
Everyone in here is going to pray.
Hang it up, she' s just playing with you.
You' re only making it worse.
You shut the hell up.
Don' t pull the trigger, she blocked the barrel.
It' il backfire.
I told you to shut up.
Can' t see...
I can' t see.
I can' t hear anything.
For God sake, Miho, finish him.
Yeah.
Make it quick, will you.
She doesn' t quite chop his head off.
She makes a Pez Dispenser out of him.
Then it' s straight to business...... stretching the corpses on the alley floor and checking their pockets...... digging up cash when they find it.
I' m fishing around in Jackie Boy' s pants.
His wallet is packed.
Master Card, Discover, Platinum American Express.
And nearly 300 bucks worth of 20s that I' m not too proud to stuff into my own pockets.
Then I find an atom bomb.
Jackie Boy.
You son of a bitch.
There was a helicopter that kicked up such a racket I couldn' t quite make out what she said.
I thought Shellie said "Stop".
She said "Cop".
Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.
"Iron Jack", the papers call him.
A goddamn hero cop.
It' s hell for years, the shaky truce.
The cops get a slice of the profits and free entertainment when they throw a party.
The girls get to administer their own brand of justice.
They get to defend their own turf.
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood and he' s not shopping for what the girls are selling.
They send him packing.
But they send him back alive.
That' s the rules.
That' s the truce.
The cops stay out.
And the Lord said unto Moses, ’’ Go.
Return into Egypt. ’’
And Moses took his wife and his son and he returned to the land of Egypt.
And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. ’
Let the ambassador from Priam, king of Troy, approach the Pharaoh.
Great Pharaoh, the gift of Troy is a fabulous fabric from the land of the five rivers.
Our thanks to Priam.
It is fabulous indeed.
- It shimmers like the Nile.
- How is it made?
No one knows.
It is spun on the looms of the gods.
They call it silk.
The ambassador from Jericho.
What kingdom has sent you?
The kingdom of the Most High.
- What gifts do you bring?
- We bring you the word of God.
What is this word?
Thus sayeth the Lord God of lsrael, ’’ Let my people go! ’’
The slaves are mine.
Their lives are mine.
All that they own is mine.
I do not know your God, nor will I let lsrael go.
Who are you to make their lives bitter in bondage?
Men shall be ruled by law, not the will of other men.
Who is this God that I should let your people go?
Aaron.
Cast down my staff before Pharaoh that he may see the power of God.
ln this you shall know that the Lord is God.
Mother!
He turned his staff into a cobra!
Nothing of HlS will harm you, my son.
The power of your God is a cheap magician’ s trick.
Jannes.
Mother, look!
Jannes, do you see?
Moses ’ serpent swallows up the others.
You gave me this staff to rule over scorpions and serpents, but God made it a rod to rule over kings.
Hear his word, Rameses, and obey.
Obey?
Are there no magicians in Egypt that you have come back to make serpents out of sticks?
Or cause rabbits to appear?
I will give your staff a greater wonder to perform.
Bear it before your idle people and bid them make bricks without straw.
- How can that be done?
- Let his staff provide them.
Or let them glean straw for themselves.
But their tally of bricks shall not diminish.
So let it be done.
(Man) Aaron.
Aaron, when do we leave Egypt?
We do not leave Egypt.
But Moses promised us.
But you said we’ d be freed!
I have brought more evil upon you.
God forgive my weak use of his strength.
(Man) Moses, what have you done to us?
It is Pharaoh ’ s order that you be given no straw to make your tally of bricks.
No straw?
How can we make bricks without straw?
You will glean the fields by night.
Your women and children, too.
ls this the deliverer?
You’ ve brought the wrath of Pharaoh upon us!
You put a sword in their hands!
Stone him!
Stone him!
Stand aside!
Come!
Follow!
There goes your deliverer.
Now go find your straw.
Remember the tally must be the same.
Not one brick less.
I cursed you.
Each time Rameses took me in his arms I cursed you, not him, because I love you.
The Moses who loved you was another man.
No, he was not.
You believe you’ ve changed, but you haven’ t.
You call yourself a prophet, a man of God, but I know better.
I don’ t believe only the thunder of a mountain stirs your heart, as you stir mine.
Nefretiri, I have stood in the burning light of God’ s own presence.
It was not he who saved you just now.
I did that.
Why, of all men, did I fall in love with the prince of fools?
But I believe anything you tell me when l’ m in your arms.
Why must you deny me and yourself?
Because I am bound to a God and to a people and to a shepherd girl.
A shepherd girl?
What can she be to you?
Unless the desert sun has dulled your senses.
Does she... grate garlic on her skin?
Or is it soft as mine?
Are her lips chafed and dry as the desert sand?
Or are they moist and red like a pomegranate?
ls it the fragrance of myrrh that scents her hair?
Or is it the odour of sheep?
There is a beauty beyond the senses, Nefretiri.
Beauty like the quiet of green valleys and still waters.
Beauty whose spirit you cannot understand.
Perhaps not.
But beauty of the spirit will not free your people, Moses.
YOU will come to me or THEY will never leave Egypt.
The fate of lsrael is not in your hands, Nefretiri.
Oh, isn’ t it?
Who else can soften Pharaoh ’ s heart?
Or harden it?
Yes.
You may be the lovely dust through which God will work his purpose.
Fill every jar with water.
For seven days there will be none to drink.
- But this well has never run dry.
- And the river is high.
- Whose word is that?
- One who knows.
So fill your jars or go thirsty.
- Miriam is always right.
- Yes, l’ m going back for more jars.
Yes, Joshua.
She comes to the well every day.
Wait and you will see her.
It is wise of Dathan to send you to the well, Lilia, or he might find his water poisoned.
They told me you were dead.
To all I love, Joshua, I am dead.
- Dathan?
- Yes.
Dathan.
Of your own free will?
Of my own free will.
You are no man’ s slave.
The hour of deliverance has come.
Not for me, Joshua.
Hail to thee, great god of the Nile!
Thy waters are the blood of Egypt.
Hail to thee, maker of barley, feeder of cattle, carrier of ships, greatest of all the gods.
Pharaoh of Egypt!
You have not yet obeyed the Lord.
Let my people go!
The point of the sword...
Let him rave that men shall know him mad.
Obey the Lord or he will raise his hand against the waters of the river.
I have come to bless the waters, you have come to curse them.
We will learn if a shepherd god is stronger than the gods of Pharaoh.
Water of life, give drink to the desert and make green the meadow.
Aaron.
Stretch out my staff against the waters.
Look!
Where he’ s touched the river, it bleeds.
The water turns to blood!
Blood flows from the god!
See how it spreads.
It lS blood!
That you may know the power of the Lord, for seven days, Egypt will thirst.
- Seven days without water!
- Pestilence will be everywhere!
Were it seven times seven days, no magician’ s trick will set your people free.
Sacred water, make pure the flood from which you came.
’ And God smote the land with all manner of plagues, ’ but still Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened. ’
Great one, you hear the cry of Egypt.
They would cry louder if THEY had to make the bricks.
Send them away.
The people have been plagued by thirst, by frogs, by lice, by flies.
They can endure no more.
Why do you bring this worker of evil before me?
The people desert the temples and turn from the gods.
You prophets and priests MADE the gods, that you may prey upon the fears of men.
When the Nile ran red, I too was afraid... until word came of a mountain beyond the cataracts which spewed red mud and poisoned the water.
Was it the staff that caused this?
Was it the wonder of your god that fish died and frogs left the water?
Was it a miracle that flies and lice should bloat upon their carrion and spread disease?
These things were ordered by themselves, not by any god!
Now go.
That you may know these things are done of God...
You shall see darkness cover Egypt when the sun climbs high to noon.
And you shall know that God is God and bow down to his will.
Nothing of this Earth can make me bow to you, Moses.
Behold, the hail comes.
When darkness has covered Egypt for three days, your ministers will send for me.
ln the three days of darkness, you have whined like frightened children in the night.
Moses said the sun would shine in three days and it is true.
Let his people go, or Egypt will be barren from the cataracts to the sea.
Will my father free the slaves?
Can taxes be collected from blighted harvests?
Does fear rule Egypt... or do l?
We fear no army of the Earth, but can we fight plagues with swords?
There is no shame in this.
It is not Pharaoh who yields to the slave, but his counsellors.
I have summoned Moses at your request.
(Counsellor) People will bless you, great one.
Does the world bow to an empty throne?
Empty?
Does a Pharaoh harden his heart against his son?
lf you let the Hebrews go, who will build HlS cities?
You told Moses to make bricks without straw.
Now HE tells YOU to make cities without bricks!
Who is the slave... and who is the Pharaoh?
Do you hear laughter, Rameses?
Yes, the laughter of kings in Babylon, in Canaan, in Troy... as Egypt surrenders to the god of slaves!
Bring the Hebrew in.
Go into the garden.
lt’ s not good for a son of Pharaoh to see his father humbled by a son of slaves.
My son, stand beside me.
Have the days of darkness made you see the light, Rameses?
Will you now free my people?
Great one, bid the scribe read the order.
Give me the writing.
You cannot resist the power of his god!
I know not his god!
Neither will I let his people go.
How long will you refuse to humble yourself before God?
lf you bring another plague upon us, it is not your god but I who will turn the Nile red with blood.
As your father’ s father did with the blood of our male children!
lf there is one more plague on Egypt, it is by YOUR word that God will bring it.
And there shall be so great a cry throughout the land that you will surely let the people go.
Come to me no more, Moses, for on the day you see my face again, you will surely die.
So let it be written.
I will give this spawn of slaves and his god an answer the world will not forget!
Commander of the Host, call on the chariots from Talis.
There SHALL be one more plague... only it will come upon the slaves of Goshen!
First- born of each house shall die, beginning with the son of Moses.
You are the shepherd girl that Moses married?
The queen of Egypt lS beautiful... as he told me.
My husband is not here.
ls this Moses ’ son?
Yes, this is our son.
What do you want of us?
You need have no fear of me.
I feared only his memory of you.
You have been able to erase it?
He has forgotten both of us.
You lost him when he went to seek his god.
I lost him when he found his god.
At least he left you a son to cherish.
I am here to save his son.
From what?
From Pharaoh ’ s decree that the first- born of lsrael must die.
Die?
God of Abraham!
Don’ t let him do this!
Not to the children!
A caravan for Midian awaits you and your son.
My chariot will take you to it.
l’ m surprised you noticed me.
You didn’ t at the palace this morning.
Why?
Were you afraid to look at me?
What do you want, Nefretiri?
You, Moses.
Everything about us is coming to an end!
You will destroy Egypt or Egypt will destroy you.
I belong to you, Moses.
She’ s gone with your son to Midian.
Why did she leave?
She knew you’ d try to save the other children before your own son.
From what?
Rameses is massing the Libyan axemen, the chariots, Sardinian swordsmen.
Why?
Tell me why!
To destroy the first- born of lsrael.
Oh, God!
My God!
Out of his own mouth comes thy judgement!
But I have saved your son!
It is not my son who will die!
It is the first- born of Egypt!
YOUR son, Nefretiri!
You would not dare strike Pharaoh ’ s son!
ln the hardness of his heart, Pharaoh brings death to his own son!
But he’ s MY son, Moses.
You would not harm MY son?
I, myself, am nothing.
God’ s power uses me to work his will.
You would not let him do this to me.
I saved YOUR son.
I cannot save yours.
Your god listens to you, Moses.
About midnight, the destroyer will come into the midst of Egypt and all the first- born shall die, from the first- born of Pharaoh to the first- born of his servants.
When you were Prince of Egypt, you held me in your arms.
I threw myself at your feet before the court of Pharaoh.
Because I loved you, Moses.
It is the Lord who executes judgement, Nefretiri.
Go back to your son.
Your love for me is stronger than the power of any god.
You will not kill my son.
Turn from thy fierce wrath, O Lord!
# To set me free
# Death cometh to me... #
No, Lilia, death will not come to you.
Joshua, you risk your life in coming here.
- You are first- born.
- So are you.
I bring lamb’ s blood to mark the doorposts and lintel... that the Angel of Death may pass you by.
Joshua, it is enough that you have come to me.
I am outcast among our people.
Don’ t save me from death, Joshua, save me from life.
Tomorrow will bring a new world.
No!
And no blood on this door!
Dathan, it will save her life!
Moses has God’ s promise!
Moses has words, Pharaoh has spears.
Remember, Joshua, of her own free will she’ s mine.
# And under his wing shalt thou trust # ’’ Though we stand in the shadow of death, ’’ the Lord is our God.
The Lord is one. ’’ (All) ’’ The Lord is one. ’’
# His truth shall be thy shield... # ’’ Shield us through this night of terror, O King of the Universe. ’’ (Woman screams)
Why is this night different from all others?
Because this night the Lord will free us from the bondage of Egypt.
# Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night # (Knock at door)
Or worse!
# Or from the arrow that flyeth by day #
Bithiah!
ln fear of your god they have set me free.
May a stranger enter?
There are no strangers among those who seek God’ s mercy.
My bearers?
All who thirst for freedom may come with us.
The darkness of death will pass over us tonight.
Tomorrow the light of freedom will shine upon us as we go forth from Egypt.
I shall go with you, Moses.
- A princess of Egypt!
- From the house of Pharaoh!
An idol- worshipper!
This woman drew me from the Nile and set my feet upon the path of knowledge.
Mered, bring a chair for Pharaoh ’ s daughter.
There is a great light shines from your face.
Perhaps some day I shall understand it.
He is God’ s messenger, Princess.
lf it is not forbidden to look upon the breath of pestilence, then see, for it is here.
Do not look, Eleazar.
Close the door, Joshua, and let death pass.
Will it pass, Moses?
Will it pass?
That is God’ s promise, Elisheba.
’’ Blessed art thou, o Lord our God ’’ Who bringeth forth bread from the earth. ’’ (Distant shouting)
(Man) Run!
Run!
There shall no evil befall you... or any plagues come near you.
# A thousand shall fall at thy sight #
Why do we eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs?
(Hoofbeats outside) (Man) Faster!
Take the other road!
The herbs remind us of the bitterness of captivity, Eleazar.
This is the bread of haste, that you will remember this night from generation to generation forever.
(Woman) Give me back my baby!
- They are my people!
- All are God’ s people.
Death is all around us!
But it passes those who have believed the Lord.
Always remember, Eleazar... he passed over your house.
Are the captains of Egypt afraid of a night mist?
- The death cry is everywhere.
- Some devil’ s curse!
Look!
l’ ve known battle for 30 years, Pharaoh, but never fear till tonight.
Aide.
Have the captains join their men.
At the coming of dawn we will strike.
No first- born Hebrew shall live.
Let the Hebrews go, great one, or we are all dead men.
He was your son?
My first- born.
There is no magic cure, no spell to use.
He is the first- born of Pharaoh.
We have no skill before this... pestilence.
My father.
My son.
Your own curse is on him.
- Where did you hear this?
- From Moses.
I would not let his people go because your serpent’ s tongue hardened my heart.
You only thought to keep Moses here.
You cared nothing for my throne... or my son.
I asked Moses for his life.
The shadow of death is on his face.
No...
He will not die.
Captain.
Take my fastest chariot.
Bring Moses to me.
I will bring him, mighty Pharaoh.
He’ s my only son.
You have conquered, Moses.
The foot of a slave is on the neck of Egypt.
You were saved from the Nile to be a curse upon me.
Your shadow fell between me and my father, between me and my fame, between me and my queen.
Your shadow now fills all things with death.
Go out from among us, you and your people.
I set you free.
It is not by your word, nor by my hand that we are free, Pharaoh.
The power of God has freed us.
Enough of your words!
Take your people, your cattle, your god and your pestilence.
Take what spoils from Egypt you will!
But go!
O Lord God... with a strong hand thou dost bring us out of bitter bondage.
Tomorrow we go forth a free nation.
For every man shall reap what he has sown and bow no knee except in prayer.
We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters...
With our flocks and with our herds will we go, for I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods.
He’ s dead.
Soca, great lord of the lower world...
I, who have denied the gods of Egypt, bow before you now.
Show that you have power above the god of Moses, and restore the life he has taken from my son.
Guide back his soul across the lake of death to the place of living men, and I will raise a temple to you mightier than the pyramids.
Hear me, dread lord of darkness...
Arise, O lsrael!
Behold the dawn of freedom!
’ And it came to pass, after the stifling night of terror, ’ came a day such as the world had never seen. ’ From east and west, from north and south, ’ they came with all they had, driving their flocks ’ and their herds and their camels before them. ’ By tens, by hundreds, by thousands, ’ unending streams of man and beast and burden, ’ and even very much cattle, ’ poured into the Avenue of Sphinxes. ’ Beneath the stone feet of the four colossal images of Rameses, ’ which their own sweat and blood and sinew ’ had hewn from solid rock, ’ a nation arose and freedom was born into the world. ’
(Child) Father, have you got Rebekka?
No, I haven’ t got Rebekka.
Here’ s the trough.
Sling it on your shoulders.
This is a blessed day!
- Here’ s Rebekka!
- Thank you!
- Can we take the cow?
- We’ re moving to the gates.
Rachel, help me with this brick yoke.
Don’ t forget the oil for the baths!
Where are we going?
To some land flowing with milk and honey!
l’ ve never tasted honey.
Anybody know the way?
lt’ s away from the whip!
Freedom will wet your throats in the desert.
This is the governor’ s house!
You cannot enter.
All of you!
Why do soldiers come here?
I put no blood on my door.
Then stone bleeds!
Your stonecutter did this to me!
All your gold cannot wipe that mark from your door... or from my heart.
For that, you’ il walk all the way to...
Where are we going?
Do you know where we’ re going?
To hell, I hope!
’ Like Dathan, they did not know where they were going, ’ and cared no more than their flocks. ’ Now they used the brick yokes for a very different burden. ’ There went forth among them ’ planters of vineyards and sowers of seeds, ’ each hoping to sit under his own vine and fig tree. ’ Out of this glorious chaos, ’ it is Joshua who brings order and purpose. ’
Set the standard of each tribe before the people!
Levite in the centre, Judah to the right, Hephron left.
(Woman) Watch where you’ re going!
Watch out for my geese!
Aaron and the elders are carrying a shrouded body, Grandfather!
They are the bones of Joseph, to rest in his own land.
Nubians, Grandfather!
- Here come treasure wagons!
- Spoils of Egypt.
All who shared the toil will share this gold!
Here, boy!
For the blind one!
A little golden calf, Grandfather, with horns!
An idol.
For idol- worshippers!
There are the fire- bearers!
Plant your fires at night beside the standards, that all may light their torches!
Eleazar, hang this on the wagon.
Now the cradle...
I have wagons for midwives and physicians.
Place them at 5, 000 cubits...
l’ il pay you back every lash you gave me, Dathan!
- ls this a day for hard feelings?
- l’ ve felt your whip!
Lilia is no slave, Dathan!
You can carry your own carton.
(Others laugh)
So, now, my brother, we have NEW task- masters.
We serve no masters now!
Yes, but not for long.
- Here.
Old woman.
That’ s it.
- Joshua!
Make way for the governor!
- You know who I am.
- I know who you WERE.
Go and tell Rameses l’ m coming back to my house.
That rabble may follow Moses into the desert today, but when their eyes are seared red by the sun and their cracked lips bleed with thirst, when their stomachs cramp with hunger, they will curse the name of Moses and his god.
Then I will lead them back to Pharaoh and the brick pits.
There are so many.
So many.
How shall I find thy road through the wilderness, Lord?
How shall I find water in the desert for this multitude?
Moses... the people are assembled.
Then let us go forth to the mountain of God, that he may write his commandments in our minds and hearts forever.
We march, praising his mighty name!
- What is the word, Joshua?
- Let the trumpets sound!
Hear, O lsrael!
Remember this day, when the strong hand of the Lord leads you out of bondage!
(All) The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!
The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!
- Yes!
Come on!
Joshua!
400 years in bondage and TODAY he won’ t move!
# The Lord is one!
Praise to God...
# Thank thee, O Lord... #
My litter can carry him.
I am poured out like water, my strength dried up into the dust... of death.
- We shall plant your fig tree!
- Children shall eat of its fruit!
Do you hear that?
You have a strong new son!
’ And he brought forth the people with joy and gladness. ’ He bore them out of Egypt ’ as an eagle bears its young upon its wings. ’ But again...
Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened. ’
How many more days and nights will you pray?
Does he hear you?
Dread Lord of Darkness, are you not greater than the god of Moses?
I have raised my voice to you, yet life has not come to the body of my son.
- Hear me!
- He cannot hear you.
He’ s nothing but a piece of stone with the head of a bird.
He WlLL hear me.
I am Egypt.
Egypt?
You are nothing.
You let Moses kill my son.
No god can bring him back.
What have you done to Moses?
How did he die?
Did he cry for mercy when you tortured him?
Bring me to his body!
I want to see it!
This is my son.
He would have been Pharaoh.
He would have ruled the world.
Who mourns him now?
Not even you.
All you can think of is Moses.
You will not see his body.
I drove him out of Egypt.
I cannot fight the power of his god.
HlS god?
The priests say that Pharaoh is a god, but you are not a god, you are even less than a man.
Listen to me, Rameses, you thought I was evil when I went to Moses, and you were right.
Shall I tell you what happened, Rameses?
He spurned me, like a strumpet in the street.
I, Nefretiri, Queen of Egypt!
All that you wanted from me he would not even take.
Do you hear laughter, Pharaoh?
Not the laughter of kings, but the laughter of slaves on the desert!
Laughter?
Laughter?
My son, I shall build your tomb upon their crushed bodies!
lf any escape, their seed shall be scattered and accursed forever!
My armour.
War crown.
Laughter?
I will turn the laughter of these slaves into wails of torment!
They SHALL remember the name of Moses, only that he died under my chariot wheels!
Kill him with your own hands.
Let the trumpet sound.
Alert the watch towers.
Assemble all the chariots at the city gate.
I obey!
Ready my chariot.
I will bring you back your temple treasure!
Bring it back to me stained with his blood.
I will!
To mingle with your own!
(Commander) Salute!
(All) Hail!
(All) Hail!
Remember your first- born!
- (All) Death to the slaves!
- Death to their god!
Hail!
Forward!
Do you hear thunder?
Over the sea?
No, it comes from the desert.
That’ s the thunder of horses!
Look!
Pharaoh ’ s chariot!
We’ re trapped against the sea!
Caleb, warn the north tents!
Joshua?
That’ s Joshua’ s horn!
All men to the pass!
Get horses, wagons!
Form a barrier!
What’ s the alarm?
Pharaoh ’ s chariot!
Block the pass with carts!
Women and children, to the sea!
Bring shovels!
Mallets!
Hear me!
Hear me!
Can mallets stop arrows?
Will your cart stop Pharaoh ’ s chariots?
Women, do you want your men killed?
Moses!
Pharaoh ’ s chariots!
l’ ve ordered men to block the pass!
- We can’ t fight chariots!
- Order the men to move back, Joshua.
Move back?
Where? lnto the sea?
lnto the hand of God.
Deliverer?
He’ s delivered you to death!
Look!
Look!
Blame Moses for this!
Deliver him to Pharaoh!
(All) Yes!
Stone him!
The god of Moses is a poor general... to leave him no retreat.
Ten times you have seen the miracles of the Lord!
And still you have no faith!
He delivers you to death!
Stone him!
Stone him!
Listen to Moses!
He speaks God’ s will!
- They will stop for me!
- A chariot knows no rank.
Was it because there where no graves in Egypt that you took us to die in the wilderness?
Fear not!
Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord!
- A pillar of fire!
- The work of God!
Through it!
No, great one!
You cannot breach the fire of God!
Gather your families and flocks.
We must go with all speed.
To drown in the sea?
How long can the fire hold?
After this day you shall see his chariots no more!
You’ il be dead under them!
The Lord of Hosts will do battle for us!
Behold his mighty hand!
The wind opens the sea!
God opens the sea with the blast of his nostrils!
- Lead them through the waters.
- His will be done!
He opens the waters for them and he bars our way with fire.
Let us go.
Men cannot fight a god!
Better to die in battle with a god, than live in shame.
Praise God and down into it!
God has delivered us!
- Help us!
- Never mind the wheel!
Pull!
Pull for your lives!
ls your life worth so much?
Save the bread if you can!
Bring Caleb to help with the wagons!
Moses!
Stand on the rock where the people can see you and have hope!
Above us!
The fire dies!
Sound the pursuit!
Chariots, halt!
This is work for a butcher, not a Pharaoh.
Destroy them all.
But bring Moses to me alive.
Level spears!
Forward!
- Here!
Take him!
- Wait!
Wait!
Grandfather, look, the horses are coming!
The chariots!
Run!
Better to serve than to die here!
Who shall withstand the power of God?
Thou didst blow with thy winds and the sea covered them!
Who is like unto Thee, O Lord?
From everlasting to everlasting... Thou art God!
(All) The Lord is one!
The Lord is one!
Before you strike... show me his blood on your sword.
You couldn’ t even kill him.
His god... lS God.
’ And Moses led lsrael from the Red Sea ’ into the wilderness of Sinai. ’ And they camped before the holy mountain. ’ And when the people saw ’ that Moses delayed to come down out of the mountain, ’ they gathered together. ’
Could anyone live on that summit for 40 days and nights?
- Yes!
By the will of God!
- Who knows the will of God?
Do you?
Or you, Sephora?
His grieving wife.
She came back to find her husband.
But even she cannot hope he lives!
Moses went up into the forbidden ground to receive God’ s law!
But he’ s not returned!
We sympathise.
But will sympathy lead us to this land flowing with milk and honey?
(Man) Now we have no leader!
Moses WlLL return... AAH!
Would a God who’ s shown you such wonders
let Moses die before his work is done?
His mother!
So beautiful is the hope of a mother!
But there are other mothers among you!
What will become of your children?
- We must have faith!
- Faith in what?
You, Aaron?
Can you lead us to this land of promise?
- Do you know where it is?
- Across the wilderness!
- Then who is to lead us?
- YOU, Dathan!
Where could I bring you but Egypt?
- Where there is death?
- No!
Where there is food!
- Pharaoh would kill us.
- Not with a god of Egypt before us!
- Make one, Aaron.
- Aaron knows the art of the temple!
(Others implore)
He will not!
He would rather see our flesh rot in the wilderness.
You WlLL make a god for us!
A god of gold!
A golden calf!
Korah shall be the high priest!
Bring baskets!
Buckets!
Shawls!
Anything you have!
Take off your earrings, your bracelets, your necklaces...
Aaron will make us a golden calf!
- The gold we took from Egypt!
- There!
From the burning bush, O Lord, you charged me to bring the people to this holy mountain, to behold your glory and receive your law.
What have I left undone?
’ l am... ’ l am... ’ l am the Lord thy God. ’ Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
’ Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.
’ And they overlaid the image with pure gold. ’ And Aaron fashioned it and smoothed it with the hammer, ’ ready to be graven by cunning art and man’ s device. ’ And he fastened it with nails that it should not move. ’ And he that smote the anvil ’ did beat the molten gold into thin plates. ’ For they had gathered their treasure into the midst of the furnace, ’ and did blow the fire upon it to melt it. ’ And they adorned themselves in rich apparel and costly array, ’ veils of blue, purple and scarlet, and fine linen wrought in Egypt. ’ And the women tread grapes into new wine. ’ ’ Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.
’ Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
’ Honour thy father and thy mother.
’ Thou shalt not kill. ’
(Cheering) ’ And the people sinned a great sin, ’ for they had made them a god of gold. ’ And they bore him upon their shoulders and rejoiced, ’ saying, ’’ This be our god, O lsrael. ’’’
Are you mourners of Moses afraid to face the new god? ’ Then they were as children who have lost their faith. ’ They were perverse and crooked and rebellious against God.
They did eat the bread of wickedness, ’ and drank the wine of violence, ’ and did evil in the eyes of the Lord. ’ And the people cried, ’’’ The graven image hath brought us joy, ’’ ’ and they worshipped the golden calf and sacrificed unto it. ’
Here is your sacrifice!
’ Thou shalt not commit adultery.
’ Thou shalt not steal.
’ Thou shalt not bear false witness ’ against thy neighbour.
’ Thou shalt not covet anything that is thy neighbour’ s. ’
(Moses) Written with the finger of God.
’ Go!
Get thee down, ’ for thy people have corrupted themselves. ’
’ And the people rose up to play and did eat and drink. ’ They were as the children of fools ’ and cast off their clothes. ’ The wicked were like a troubled sea ’ whose waters cast up mire and dirt. ’ They sank from evil to evil and were viler than the earth. ’ And there was rioting and drunkenness, ’ for they had become servants of sin. ’ There was manifest all manner of ungodliness and works of the flesh. ’ Even adultery and lasciviousness, ’ uncleanness, idolatry and rioting, ’ vanity and wrath. ’ And they were filled with iniquity and vile affections. ’ And Aaron knew that he had brought them to shame. ’
Abiram!
Korah!
Bind the sacrifice with cord!
Even unto the horns of the altar!
The light of God shines from you, Moses.
Do not kneel to me, Joshua.
These tablets of stone...
The writing of God.
His Ten Commandments.
There is a noise of war in the camp.
It is not the noise of war.
It is the noise of song and revelry.
Moses!
Joshua!
Woe unto thee, oh lsrael.
You have sinned a great sin in the sight of God!
You are not worthy to receive these Ten Commandments.
Aaron!
We are gathered against you, Moses!
You take too much upon yourself!
We will not live by your commandments.
We are free!
There is no freedom without the law.
Whose law?
Yours?
Did you carve the tablets to become a prince over us?
Who is on the Lord’ s side...
let him come to me!
(Confused shouts)
- You have cursed us.
- These people made me.
He showed you no milk and honey!
I show you a god of gold!
Come with me!
Follow me!
Blasphemers! ldolaters!
For this you shall drink bitter waters!
God has set before you this day his laws of life and good and death and evil.
Those who will not live by the law... (Shouts of panic) shall die by the law!
’ And the Lord’ s anger was kindled against lsrael. ’ And to prove whether they would keep his commandments or no, ’ he made them wander in the wilderness 40 years, ’ until the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord ’ was consumed. ’ But Moses ’ eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. ’ And he went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountains, ’ and the Lord showed him all the land ’ that was beyond the river Jordan. ’
The Lord was angry with me because I disobeyed him by the waters of strife.
And he said unto me, ’’ Behold the new land with thine eyes. ’’ Thou shalt not cross over this river Jordan. ’’
Then I shall stay.
I am called by the Lord, Sephora.
I go alone.
Look, Moses.
The people have come to the river Jordan.
ln the Ark they carry the law you brought them.
You taught them not to live by bread alone.
You are God’ s torch, that lights the way to freedom.
I love you.
Joshua, I charge you and strengthen you, for you shall go over Jordan to lead the people.
As for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord.
Mered, give me the books.
Eleazar... set these five books in the Ark of the Covenant, by the tablets of the Ten Commandments, which the Lord restored unto us.
Go.
Proclaim liberty throughout all the lands, unto all the inhabitants thereof.
[Man]
[Man # 2]
Roger that.
"the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure... on which man has ever embarked."
We got a short! - and after that sudden, horrible fire... on the launchpad during a routine test... that killed American astronauts Gus Grissom,
- Ed White and Roger Chaffee, - Get us outta here! there were serious doubts that we could beat the Russians to the moon.
landed on the moon.
The big news came just a moment ago.
Mission Control gave the spacecraft permission... to go for the extravehicular activity -- that is, for the walk on the moon -- far earlier than anticipated, 9: 00 p. m.
The important thing when you' re penetrating the lunar module... is your attitude and your relative speed.
Let' s say this is me in the command module and this is you,
- All right. - in the LEM.
That' s called a probe.
- ls that true?
- Absolutely.
And, Tracey, when you feel that thing slide in, everything' s clickin ', it' s like no other feeling in the world.
- A little liquid propulsion.
- What' s the big occasion?
How' s it goin 'at Mission Control?
It' s a nervous time.
They' re pacin 'around, smokin' like chimneys.
Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies.
Jim Lovell.
- This is Tracey.
- How do ya do, Tracey?
- This is the man.
Apollo 8.
- This guy did ten laps.
- With one hand on the wheel.
Hey, Marilyn.
- This is the last champagne in Houston.
Very good.
- Everything else all right?
- Everything' s on course.
Hey!
Cadet Lovell.
Put this on ice.
Make sure it gets cold.
- You gonna get a haircut this summer?
- I' m on vacation.
Oh, get a haircut.
- I wouldn' t mind bein 'up there tonight.
- God, who wouldn' t.
Don' t worry.
Our day' s comin '.
They' re not gonna cut the program before number 14.
- Uh- huh.
Asked who we bribed to get on Jim Lovell' s crew.
I told him they wanted to make sure he got the best.
Well, they got that right.
- Come on!
Put on Walter!
- Jules Bergman!
John, turn it up!... has completed putting on the spacesuits and the boots.
I really appreciate you all coming to this dress rehearsal party...
- for my Apollo 12 landing.
Sit down, Conrad.
I think we should all take a moment to recognize... the exemplary -- hell, damn near heroic -- effort displayed by Neil Armstrong' s backup for this historic moon walk, and, of course, his crew.
Let' s hear it for Jim Lovell, Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise.
There he is!
There he is!
Hey!
Kids!
We had a good touchdown.
We can verify the position of the opening I ought to have on the camera.
What?
You think it' s too late for him to abort?
He still has time to get out.
He just needs somebody to wave him off.
Pull up, Neil!
- Pull up!
Okay, Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.
Wow.
I' m at the foot of the ladder.
The LEM footpads are only depressed in the surface about, uh... one or two inches.
- It' s almost like a powder.
Armstrong is on the moon.
Neil Armstrong, 38- year- old American, standing on the surface of the moon... on this July 20, 1969.
That' s one small step for man... one giant leap for mankind.
"That' s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
- You' re drunk, Lovell.
I' m not used to the champagne.
Me neither.
I can' t deal with cleaning up.
Let' s sell the house.
All right, let' s sell the house.
They' re back inside now, lookin 'up at us.
lsn' t that somethin '?
I bet Jannie Armstrong doesn' t get a wink of sleep tonight.
When you were on the far side on 8, I didn' t sleep at all.
I just vacuumed over and over again.
Christopher Columbus, Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong.
Neil Armstrong.
From now on, we live in a world where man has walked on the moon.
It' s not a miracle.
We just decided to go.
On Apollo 8, we were so close, just 60 nautical miles down and --
It was like I could just... step out and walk on the face of it.
I want to go back there.
Where' s my mountain?
It' s, uh, right up by the --
It' s -- Okay, do you see where the shadow crosses... the white area there?
That' s the Sea of Tranquility, and your mountain' s there, on the edge of that.
It' s your mountain.
Mount Marilyn.
I don' t see it.
Well, you gotta look harder.
- [Chuckling]
Jim!
[Lovell]
The astronaut is only the most visible member... of a very large team, and all of us down to the guy sweeping the floor... are honored to be a part of it.
"Give me a lever long enough and I' il move the world"?
That' s what we' re doing here.
This is divine inspiration.
It' s the best part of each one of us, the belief that anything is possible.
Things like a computer that can fit into a single room... and hold millions of pieces of information, or the Saturn 5 rocket.
This is the actual launch vehicle that will be taking Alan Shepard... and his crew on the first leg of the Apollo 13 mission.
When are you going up again, Jim?
I' m slated to be the commander of Apollo 14 sometime late next year.
lf there is an Apollo 14.
Jim, people in my state have been asking why we' re continuing... to fund this program now that we' ve beaten the Russians to the moon.
lmagine if Christopher Columbus had come back from the new world... and no one returned in his footsteps.
Attention, all personnel.
Clear level three.
Are there any other questions?
How do you go to the bathroom in space?
Well, I tell you, it' s a highly technical process... of cranking down the window and looking for a gas station, which --
- Oh, there' s Deke Slayton.
Deke, you might be able to answer this lady' s question.
Deke is one of the original Mercury seven astronauts, ladies and gentlemen.
Now he' s our boss.
He hands out the astronauts' flight assignments, so naturally we kick back part of our salaries to Deke.
- How much this month?
- Something' s come up.
- Sure, you -- Uh, Henry?
- Anybody home?
- I' m not being a cheerleader, Mom!
You don' t understand!
I worked so hard on this!
Maybe I don' t understand, but you' re not wearing that out in this neighborhood.
She' s not even wearing a bra!
- You can see everything!
Hey, everybody.
Marilyn, trick or treat.
You know that Easter vacation trip we had planned for Acapulco?
I was thinkin 'there might be a slight change in destination.
Really?
Maybe, say... the moon.
Al Shepard' s ear infection has flared up, and we' ve all been bumped up to the prime crew of Apollo 13.
Straight to the head of the line and the Fra Mauro highlands.
Six months?
You' re moving up six months?
- Dad, can I please wear this?
- Sure.
- No!
Absolutely not.
- They' re not rushing things, are they?
You' re gonna be ready in six months?
We' il be ready.
I wouldn' t want to be around Al Shepard tonight.
We' re gonna have to get up to speed.
- Go, go.
- I' m gonna walk on the moon, Marilyn.
I know.
I can' t believe it.
Naturally, it' s 13.
It comes after 12, hon.
Apollo 13, you are go for docking.
All systems are nominal and on the line.
Okay, S- 4B is stable, slot panels are drifting free.
The drogue is clear.
The docking target is clear.
[Mattingly]
I' m comin 'up on that now.
Two... one... mark.
Seventy- five feet.
We' re comin 'up on docking.
Let' s shut down some thrusters on 'em.
We' il see what he does.
Wait a minute.
I lost something here.
I can' t translate up.
Houston, we are drifting down and away.
- Wanna back off and take another run?
- No, I got it.
Let me just try and get it stable here.
I' m gonna reset the high gain.
I' ve got the target back in the reticle.
We' re stable.
Go ahead and recycle the valves.
Forty feet.
- They' re all gray.
Twenty.
Ten feet.
- Capture.
- That' s it!
- That' s it.
- Sweet move, Ken.
- Gentlemen, that is the way we do that.
- Man, that woke me up.
Apollo 13 backup crew, you' re up in the simulator.
- Nice job, Jim.
- That' s three hours of boredom... followed by seven seconds of sheer terror.
Good job, guys.
You just won the Christmas turkey.
Nice try, Frank.
You really outfoxed 'em, brother.
Yeah, but it wasn' t perfect.
Used up too much fuel.
You' re above the curve.
Not by much.
Listen, guys, I wanna work it again.
We gotta be up with the dawn patrol headed for Bethpage, what, 0700?
- Wheels up at 0700.
- Yeah, I know, but my rate of turn is still a little slow.
I really think we should work it again.
- Well, let' s get it right.
- Okay, set it up again, Frank.
Okay, 13 backup crew.
It' il have to wait.
- Prime crew' s up for another run.
Apollo 13, we show S- 4B shutdown... and all systems are nominal.
Fred, set the S- band omni to B, and when you get in the LEM, two forward.
- Good shape over here.
- [Alarm Buzzing]
- Hey, we got a problem.
- [Astronauts Shouting]
- Ken, get your helmet on!
- I can' t get it locked!
[Astronauts Shouting]
Oh, God!
I thought the stars would fall down on you.
That' s silly.
Stars can' t fall on us.
You' re a smarter kid than I was.
How long will it take to get to the moon?
Four days.
But that' s pretty fast.
See, this is the Saturn 4B booster, and it shoots us away from the Earth... as fast as a bullet from a gun... until the moon' s gravity actually grabs us and pulls us... into a circle around the moon... which is called an orbit.
All right?
Fred and I float down the tunnel into the lunar module, this spidery- lookin 'guy.
Only holds two people, and it' s just for landin 'on the moon.
And I take the controls and I steer it around... and I fly it down, adjustin 'it here, the attitude there, pitch, roll... for a nice, soft landing on the moon.
Better than Neil Armstrong.
Way better than Pete Conrad.
Dad... did you know the astronauts in the fire?
All of 'em.
Could that happen again?
Well, I' il tell ya somethin 'about that fire.
Um, a lot of things went wrong.
The, uh -- The door.
It' s called the hatch.
They couldn' t get it open when they needed to get out.
That was one thing.
Well, a lot of things went wrong in that fire.
Oh, yes.
Absolutely.
We fixed it.
It' s not a problem anymore.
I can' t believe they still have you doing public appearances.
Well, Henry Hurt was... all over me.
But with a training schedule this tight --
Well, it' s -- It' s the program, Marilyn.
You know, it' s NASA.
Hey, you' re Jim Lovell, aren' t ya?
[Laughing]
Lucky 13!
Right on!
That' s the second time it' s done that.
I was looking at the kids' school schedule coming up.
- It' s a very busy week.
I' m thinking about not going to the launch.
The kids need me at home, honey.
Marilyn, we' ve had these kids for awhile now.
They' ve never kept you from comin 'to the other launches.
She' s just had this stroke.
Mom' s fine.
It' s not like I' ve never been to a launch.
The other wives have not done three.
I just don' t think I can go through all that.
I' il just be glad when this one' s over.
Well, you' re gonna miss a hell of a show.
- Hey, guys.
See ya in a few weeks.
Take care.
Bring us back a moon rock.
So the number 13 doesn' t bother you.
Only if it' s a Friday, Phil.
Apollo 13, lifting off at 1300 hours and 13 minutes... and entering the moon' s gravity on April 13?
Ken Mattingly here has been doing some scientific experiments... regarding that very phenomenon, haven' t you?
Well, I had a black cat, uh, walk over a broken mirror... under the lunar module ladder.
It didn' t seem to be a problem.
[Laughing]
Does it bother you that the public regards this flight as routine?
There' s nothing routine about flying to the moon.
I can vouch for that.
And, uh, I think that an astronaut' s last mission -- his final flight -- that' s always going to be very special.
Why is this your last, Jim?
I' m in command of the best ship... with the best crew that anybody could ask for, and I' il be walking in a place where there' s 400 degrees difference... between sunlight and shadow.
I can' t imagine, uh, ever topping that.
We have that scheduled for 0900 hours tomorrow.
- That' s not gonna work, Walter.
- Why?
Freddo and I are gonna be goin 'over the lunar surface experiments tomorrow... and Ken' s gonna be back in the simulator.
We' re gonna be goin 'over the flight plan tonight.
Thanks.
Jim, we' ve got a problem.
We just got some blood work back from the lab.
Charlie Duke has the measles.
So we need a new backup.
- You' ve all been exposed to it.
- Oh, I' ve had the measles.
Ken Mattingly hasn' t.
You wanna break up my crew two days before the launch... when we can predict each other' s moves, read the tone of each other' s voices?
Ken Mattingly will be getting seriously ill... precisely when you and Haise will be ascending from the lunar surface.
That' s a lousy time for a fever.
Jack Swigert has been out of the loop for weeks.
He' s fully qualified to fly this mission.
I' m sorry, Jim.
I understand how you feel.
We can do one of two things.
We can scrub Mattingly and go with Swigert, or we can bump all three of you to a later mission.
I' ve trained for the Fra Mauro highlands, and this is flight surgeon horseshit, Deke!
Jim, if you hold out for Ken, you will not be on Apollo 13.
It' s your decision.
- [Woman]
Listen, l- I gotta take that.
- Oh, why?
- Because I' m on the backup crew, and the backup crew has to set up the guest list and book the hotel room.
Swigert.
Yes, sir.
Uh- uh, I understand.
- Thank you, sir.
Damn.
Medical guys.
I had a feeling when they started doing all the blood tests that --
I know it' s their ass if I get sick up there, but, I mean -- Jesus!
He' s, uh --
He' s strong.
It' il be a hell of a mission.
One for the books.
You sure about this?
Why don' t I talk to Deke?
I' m sure we can work this out.
This was my call.
Must' ve been a tough one.
Look, I don' t have the measles.
I' m not gonna get the measles.
Shit.
Trajectory is holding steady.
We' re right on the line.
We' re in 05 G' s, so we' re feeling that gravity now.
Houston, we are at 400, 000 feet passing entry interface.
About to lose signal.
Reentry data is nominal, and we have radio blackout.
What' s the story here?
I got a corridor light.
We' re comin 'in too shallow.
I' m goin 'to manual.
Houston, switching to S. C. S. - Roger, Thirteen.
Okay, we' re at three G' s.
Five G' s.
We' re comin 'in too steep.
I' il stay in this roll, see if I can pull us out.
We' re at eight G' s.
Ten.
- [Beeping]
- Twelve G' s.
We' re burnin 'up.
- Damn it!
I gave 'em a false indicator light at entry interface.
Even Mattingly didn' t get it the first time.
How ya feelin ', Freddo?
Charbroiled.
So what happened?
Came in too steep.
We' re dead.
No shit.
Yeah, we were into program 67 there, so --
Okay, we' re gonna do this again, obviously, but give us a minute to get our switches reset.
Jim, could we have a word?
Oh, sure, Deke.
I wouldn' t have to work for you, Deke.
Well, we have two days.
We' il be ready.
Let' s do it again.
Do it again.
Margaret, get them!
Fred, Stephen, come here!
You' il fall!
We can' t go across that road.
We don' t want Daddy to get our germs and get sick in outer space.
Hey, boys.
Not givin 'your mom a hard time, are ya?
Princess, you look beautiful.
Well, hey, that looks like Marilyn Lovell.
But it can' t be.
She' s not coming to the launch.
I heard it was gonna be a hell of a show.
- Who told you that?
- Some guy I know.
[Man]
Okay, folks.
Let' s say good night.
- Good night!
You hear about Ken?
Yeah.
Stand back, please.
Ah, Guenter Wendt.
I wonder where Guenter went?
- You walk on ze moon, ja?
and we talk on ze moon.
How do you feel?
Good.
Might be a little warmer in here, huh?
- How are you today?
- Good.
Yeah.
Oh, God, no!
- We have the oxygen burn system?
- Check.
- Check.
- [Gas Hisses]
Communication umbilical on.
- What?
- Gum.
- Aw, sorry.
Thanks.
I' m gonna give these guys a beautiful ride.
Sure you will, Jack.
You need more air?
You want some apple?
Aw, I hate this already.
No.
I got 30 days' til this blastoff.
This is for Gene.
Mrs. Kranz has pulled out the needle and thread again.
The last one looked like he bought it off a gypsy.
[Kranz]
This is from your wife, Gene.
Thank you, Tom.
I was startin 'to get worried.
There we go.
I like that one, Gene.
- Sharp, Gene.
Jim, you' re all set.
Very sharp.
Hey, Gene, I guess we can go now.
Save it for splashdown, guys.
Apollo 13 flight controllers, listen up.
Give me a go, no go for launch.
- Go.
- RETRO.
- FlDO.
- Guidance.
- Guidance go.
- Surgeon.
- Go, Flight.
- EECOM.
- We' re go, Flight.
- TELMU.
- Go.
- Control.
- Go, Flight.
- Procedures.
- lNCO.
- We are go.
- Network.
- Go.
- Go.
- CAPCOM.
- We' re go, Flight.
We are go for launch.
Roger that, Houston.
Pad leader, what' s your status?
- [Cheering]
T minus 60 seconds and counting.
- [Man On Radio]
Stand by.
Fuel pumps.
This is it.
A few bumps and we' re haulin 'the mail.
They' re ready for takeoff.
We are go for launch.
- six... ignition sequence starts...
- [Rumbling]
three... two... one... ignition!
The clock is running!
We have liftoff!
Houston, we have cleared the tower at 1313.
Okay, guys, we got it.
Come on, baby.
Altitude is on the line.
Velocity right on the line.
Roll complete.
We are pitching.
Thirteen, stand by for mode one Bravo.
- FlDO, how we lookin '?
Right down the middle.
[CAPCOM]
We see your B. P. C. is clear, Thirteen.
Roger.
E. D. S. to manual.
lnboard.
Get ready for a little jolt, fellas.
That was some little jolt.
Tower jett.
Houston, we' ve got a center engine cutoff.
Go on the other four.
We show the same.
- Roger.
Looks like we lost it.
- FlDO, what' s that going to do?
Stand by, Flight.
I need to know if the l. U. 's correcting for the shutdown.
Houston, what' s the story on engine five?
We' re still go.
We' il be all right as long as we don' t lose another one.
Roger that.
Thirteen, we' re not sure why the inboard was out, but the other engines are go, so we' re gonna burn those engines... a little bit longer.
Roger that.
Our gimbals are good.
Our trim is good.
Looks like we just had our glitch for this mission.
Thirteen, stand by for staging.
- Roger that.
S- 2 shutdown.
S- 4B ignition.
Thrust looks good, Flight.
Flight, S- 4B cutoff in ten seconds.
Thirteen, this is Houston.
Predicted cutoff is 12 plus 34, over.
Coming up on 12 minutes 34.
- [Lovell]
And -- - SECO!
Shutdown.
And that, gentlemen, is how we do that.
Oh, boy.
Hope I can sleep.
Mom, that was loud.
Here, hold my hand.
I can' t believe you did this four times.
- The worst part' s over.
This doesn' t stop for me until he lands on that aircraft carrier.
Well, you just look so calm about it.
[Reporters]
Mrs. Lovell!
Mrs. Haise!
Can we speak to you?
Can we just have a word with you?
- How' re ya feeling?
- Well, very proud... and very happy, and we' re thrilled.
Flight, Booster.
I show S- 4B shutdown.
T. L. l. is on the money.
Looks good, Flight.
Roger, FlDO.
We' re goin 'to the moon.
Flight, we have reacquisition of signal at Hawaii.
Flight, everything looks good.
C. M. P. here.
I' ve exchanged couches with Jim.
I' m in the pilot' s seat.
I' m gonna go ahead and get set for transposition and docking.
Roger that, Jack.
Freddo, you okay?
Okay, let' s get turned around and pick up the lunar module.
Odyssey, you' re go for pyro arm and docking, and we recommend you secure cabin pressurization.
Roger that.
Okay, we' re ready for C. S. M. separation.
Okay, S. M. R. C. S. isol valves are all gray.
Okay, Swigert, command module pilot, she' s all yours.
- [CAPCOM]
The S- 4B is stable.
- Translation looks good.
- We confirm that, Thirteen.
- We' re gonna start to pitch around... to line up with the LEM.
You know, Freddo, Frank Borman... was upchuckin 'most of the way to the moon on Apollo 8.
I' m all right.
Let' s go to work.
And pitching up.
Pitch rate, 2. 5 degrees per second.
Roger, Jack.
[Kranz]
Keep an eye on that telemetry.
Roger that. lf Swigert can' t dock this thing, we don' t have a mission.
- How' s the alignment?
- G. D. C. align.
- [Jets Fire]
One hundred feet.
[Jets Firing]
Ah, don' t worry, guys.
I' m on top of it.
FlDO, let me know when you' re ready.
- Okay, let' s uplink that.
- How we lookin '?
Forty feet.
[Jet Fires]
[Haise]
Come on, rookie, park that thing.
Ten feet.
- That' s it.
- Talk back is barber pole.
- Go ahead and retract.
Houston, we have hard dock.
That' s a good deal, Jack.
Let' s start back up with procedure 17.
Okay, Houston, we have LEM extraction.
We copy that, Thirteen.
Now you' re off to the Fra Mauro highlands.
- I gotta get out of this suit.
- Houston, we are ready... for the beginning of the P. T. C., and I think once we' re in that barbecue roll, Jack and I will eat.
- Are you sure?
I could eat the ass out of a dead rhinoceros.
- By the numbers so far.
We just ran a minimum load test on the cooling system.
- See you tomorrow.
- Take care.
- [Liquid Draining]
[Chuckling]
Overboard dump comin 'up.
- [Hissing]
- Here it comes, the constellation Urion.
Now, that' s a beautiful sight.
Barbara, we are going to your father' s broadcast.
I' m never coming out!
I hate Paul!
No one else can ever play their records again!
She' s still going on about the stupid Beatles breaking up?
You' re stupid!
- Barbara!
- I' m not going, Mom!
Dad won' t know if we' re there!
The whole world is going to be watching this broadcast, and so are we.
Okay, uh, good evening, America, and welcome aboard Apollo 13.
I' m Jim Lovell, and we' re broadcasting to you tonight... from an altitude of almost 200, 000 miles... away from the face of the Earth, and we have a pretty good show in store for you tonight.
Barbara.
One of the first things we' d like to do... is provide you with the appropriate background music.
So, uh, hit it there, Freddo.
That, uh, was supposed to be the theme to 2001, in honor of our command module Odyssey, but there seems to have been a change in the program.
When I go up on 19, I' m gonna take my entire collection of Johnny Cash along.
- Where' s their broadcast?
All the networks dumped us.
One said we made goin 'to the moon as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh.
My son' s supposed to be on.
He' s in outer space.
This is all the channels we get, Mrs. Lovell.
It' s that damn TV Guide again.
- Come here and take -- - Do they know they' re not on the air?
We' il tell them when they get back.
I forgot to file my 1040 return.
- I meant to do it today, but --
That' s no joke.
They' il jump on him.
Well, folks, let' s head on down to the lunar excursion module.
- [Lovell]
Fred Haise and I will float through this access tunnel... into the lunar module, leaving --
... the spacecraft will remain connected.
Well, folks, as you can probably tell, the Aquarius isn' t much bigger than a couple of telephone booths.
The skin of the LEM in some places... is only as... as thick as a couple of layers... of tinfoil, and that' s all that protects us from the vacuum of space.
We get away with this because the LEM is designed only for flight in outer space.
Fred Haise, Renaissance man.
Okay, we' il head back up the tunnel now and back into the Odyssey.
All right, we' ve returned to the -- - [Bang]
Stand by one, Houston.
Gotcha!
Houston, that bang you heard was Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve.
He gets our hearts goin 'every time with that one.
Okay, we' re, uh, about to close out the Aquarius... and, uh, return to the Odyssey.
Our next broadcast will be from Fra Mauro on the surface of the moon.
So, uh, this is the crew of the Apollo 13... wishing everyone back on Earth a... a pleasant evening.
[Sighs]
Daddy was funny.
They might air a few minutes of it on the news tonight.
- You' d think so.
- Bye.
I' d say that was a pretty successful broadcast.
That was an excellent show.
- Thank you very much, Houston.
We' ve got a couple of housekeeping procedures.
We' d like you to roll right to 0- 6- 0 and null your rates.
Rolling right, 0- 6- 0.
And then if you could give your oxygen tanks a stir.
Roger that.
- [Buzzing]
- [Alarms Continue]
- Nothing.
I stirred the tanks.
- Whoa!
Say again please.
Houston, we have a problem.
We have a main bus B undervolt.
- We' ve got a lot of thruster activity.
[Lovell]
It just went off- line.
There' s another master alarm.
- That was no repress valve.
- Maybe it' s in quad C.
- We' ve got a computer restart.
- I' m gonna reconfigure the R. C. S. - We' ve got a ping light.
The way these are firing doesn' t make sense.
We' ve got multiple caution and warning.
We' ve got to reset and restart.
I' m going to S. C. S.
Flight, their heart rates are skyrocketing.
- EECOM, what' s your data telling you?
- O2 tank two not reading at all.
Tank one is at 725 psi and falling.
Fuel cells one and three are, uh --
Oh, boy, what' s going on here?
Flight, let me get back to you.
- Flight, they' re all over the place.
- They keep yawing close to gimbal lock.
- I keep losing radio signal.
Flight, their antennae must be flipped around.
One at a time, people.
ls this an instrumentation problem, or are we looking at power loss?
That can' t happen.
It' s got to be instrumentation.
Let' s get the hatch buttoned.
The LEM might have been hit by a meteor.
The tunnel' s really torquin 'with all this movement.
- [Alarms Continue]
- [CAPCOM]
Main bus A undervolt?
- Main bus A undervolt down to --
Main bus B is reading zip now.
We got a wicked shimmy up here.
These guys are talking about bangs and shimmies.
- [CAPCOM]
You are breaking up, Thirteen.
- Can' t get this hatch to seal.
Just stow it. lf we' d been hit by a meteor, we' d be dead by now.
I' m gonna try to get us out of this lurch.
- Roger that, Thirteen.
- [Haise]
It' s fighting me.
What' s the story?
We keep flirting with gimbal lock.
[CAPCOM]
We need a confirmation.
What systems do you have down?
- S. M. R. C. S. Helium one.
- A and C are barber pole.
Houston, I' m switching over quad C to main A.
- Roger that, Thirteen.
- Okay, Houston, fuel cell one, fuel cell three.
We got a main bus B undervolt, cryo pressure, suit compressor.
What don' t we have?
A. C. bus one, A. C. bus two, command module computer and O2 flow high.
Maybe this is a caution and warning failure.
Houston, we are venting something out into space.
I can see it outside of window one right now.
It' s definitely, uh... a gas of some sort.
It' s got to be the oxygen.
Roger, Odyssey.
We copy your venting.
- Give me an alignment.
- Think about things we can connect.
- Anything look abnormal?
Okay, listen up.
Quiet down, people.
Let' s stay cool, people.
Procedures, I need another computer up in the R. T. C. C.
I want everybody to alert your support teams.
Wake up anybody you need and get them in here.
Let' s work the problem, people.
Thirteen, Houston.
We are going around the room.
We' re gonna get you answers.
[Swigert]
We keep venting, we' re gonna keep hitting the edge of that deadband.
Take a look at the O2 on number one.
200 pounds and falling.
Tank one:
218 psi and falling.
[Haise]
ls that what you' re gettin '?
- [CAPCOM]
We' re seeing the same, Thirteen.
- Can we review our status, Sy?
Let' s look at this thing from a standpoint of status.
[Sighs]
I' il get back to you, Gene.
We' re not gonna have power much longer.
- The ship' s bleedin 'to death.
- [Kranz]
Yeah.
Go, EECOM.
Um, Flight, I recommend we shut down the reactant valves of the fuel cells.
What the hell good is that gonna do?
lf that' s where the leak is, we can isolate it there... and we can save what' s left in the tanks and run on the good cell.
You close 'em, you can' t open' em again.
You can' t land on the moon with one healthy fuel cell.
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.
From my chair here, this is the last option.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, Sy.
Thirteen, this is Houston.
We want you to close react valves on cells one and three.
Do you copy?
Are you saying you want the whole smash?
Closing down the react valves for fuel cells shut down?
Shutting down the fuel cells?
Did I hear you right?
Yeah, they heard me right.
Yeah, Jim.
We think that closing the react valves may stop the leak.
- Do you copy, Jim?
Yes, Houston, we copy.
We just lost the moon.
Okay, Freddo, shut those down.
Let' s see what this does.
lf this doesn' t work, we' re not gonna have enough power left to get home.
- Shit!
- Goddamn it!
Uh, Houston, O2 on one is still falling.
Freddo, how long does it take to power up the LEM?
Three hours by the checklist.
We don' t have that much time.
Shit!
Jack, before the batteries completely die on us in here,
let' s power down everything so we can save as much as we can for reentry.
Fifteen minutes of oxygen and that' s it.
Okay.
Okay, guys, listen up.
Here' s the drill.
We' re moving the astronauts to the LEM.
We' ve got to get some oxygen up there.
The essential hardware only.
GNC, EECOM, we' re gonna be shutting down the command module at the same time.
We' il have to transfer the guidance system from one computer to the other, so I want those numbers up and ready when our guys are in position.
We' ve gotta transfer all control data over the LEM computer... before the command module dies.
The lunar module just became a lifeboat.
Odyssey, this is Houston.
We need you to power down immediately.
You' re gonna have to power up the LEM at the same time, so get somebody over there.
[CAPCOM]
We' ve got serious time pressure.
How much time?
Can you give me a number?
We' re looking at less than 15 minutes of life support in the Odyssey.
We' ve got 15 minutes, Freddo.
[Lovell]
Houston, be aware I' ve moved from the command module into the LEM.
- That' s right.
I' il be in 210.
[Swigert]
Are you back with me now?
Aquarius, this is Houston.
You have about 12 minutes to power up.
I can' t see any stars.
There' s a lot of debris floatin 'around out there.
Now I' m ready to power down the computer.
I' m gonna need your gimbal angles, Jack, before you shut down the computer.
Okay, Jim.
All right, all right.
I got it.
Hold on.
- [Haise]
Houston, our computer is up.
- [CAPCOM]
Roger.
Jack, we need to proceed with steps 12 through 17 quickly.
You' re down to about eight minutes remaining.
Fuel cell pump' s off.
O2 fans, tank two off.
Okay, Houston, check me.
I have completed these gimbal conversions, but I need a double check of the arithmetic.
- Yeah, you can go, Jim.
- The roll CAL angle is minus two.
Lunar module roll is 355. 57.
1678 -- Correction.
167. 78.
- Stand by.
[Lovell]
We' ve got negative visibility in our star field, and if this paperwork isn' t right, who knows where we' il end up out here?
Looks good, Flight.
- Good here.
- He' s good, Andy.
- We' il go on those numbers.
You' re good.
[CAPCOM]
Jack, turn off the l. M. U. Switch to S. C. S.
Over.
It' s a great day in New York.
It' s girl watchers' weather.
I like those ingenious girl watchers who put on Con Edison helmets... and dig trenches in the street to get a better view.
ls it Swigert?
Yeah, first bachelor.
He' s the kind, they say, has a girl in every port.
He has that reputation.
I think he' s sort of foolishly optimistic, taking nylons and Hershey bars to the moon.
What do you say?
Less viewers or fewer viewers?
Three million fewer viewers watched the space shot than did the last one.
An ABC New --
Here is ABC science editor Jules Bergman.
The Apollo 13 spacecraft has lost all electrical power, and astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert... are making their way through the tunnel to the lunar module, using it as a lifeboat, so they' il have electrical power for their radios on the command module.
Slow down.
An electrical failure.
What exactly does that mean?
The emergency has ruled out any chance of a lunar landing... and could endanger the lives of the astronauts themselves... if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever is left of the command module' s oxygen, can' t last them until they can get back to Earth.
What do you mean there' s no immediate danger?
Can they get back?
[Bergman]
The LEM' s descent rocket engine will be used in aborting the mission... and getting the astronauts safely back to Earth.
The Apollo 13 astronauts may be in grave danger.
No, don' t give me that NASA bullshit!
[CAPCOM]
- Roger that.
- Houston, wait!
[CAPCOM]
You' re down to about five minutes now, Jack.
We have no attitude control on Aquarius.
They don' t have control?
Did we miss a step here?
- What?
I don' t know.
[Frantic Chattering]
We' re all out of whack.
I' m trying to pitch down, but we' re yawing to the left.
[Haise]
She wasn' t designed to fly attached like this.
It' s like flying with a dead elephant on our back.
Flight, Guidance.
We' re getting awfully close to center here.
Watch that middle gimbal.
We don' t want you tumbling off into space.
Freddo, inform Houston I' m well aware of the goddamn gimbals!
[Lovell]
I don' t need to hear the obvious.
I' ve got the frappin 'eight- ball in front of me!
Aquarius, this is Houston.
[Haise]
You want us to go to VOX?
You have a hot mike.
We are reading everything you say.
Sorry, Jim.
- [Woman]
Marilyn?
I' m sorry.
Jeffrey' s calling for you.... the terseness of Kraft and the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.
- This has been a very close call.
We' re not out of the woods yet.
Jeffrey?
Why are so many people here?
Oh, well, you know... your dad' s flying his mission.
He said he was going to get me a moon rock.
Right.
Well... something broke on your daddy' s spaceship, and he' s gonna have to turn around before he even gets to the moon.
Was it the door?
- How you doing?
- [Lovell]
Houston, Aquarius.
- [CAPCOM]
Uh, roger that, Aquarius.
- Have him close it out.
Jack, we can close out your procedure now.
Do we know for sure that we can power this thing back up?
It' s gonna get awfully cold in here.
Copy that, Jack.
We' il just have to deal with that later.
- We' re clear.
We' re going to the LEM.
We confirm shutdown, Jack.
Lunar module now in control.
Roger that, Houston.
This is Odyssey signing off.
Freddo, we' re gonna have to execute some sort of burn.
It' s a matter of when.
- Did they shut us all down in there?
- Yeah.
Didn' t think we' d be back in here so soon.
Over.
Okay, people, listen up!
Gentlemen, I want you all to forget the flight plan.
From this moment on, we are improvising a new mission.
Sorry about that.
- Find a bulb around here.
How do we get our people home?
Do we turn 'em around?
- Yes!
- I can' t guarantee the burn yet.
- No, sir, no, sir, no, sir!
We get them on a free- return trajectory.
I agree with Jerry.
We use the moon' s gravity to slingshot them around.
The LEM will not support three guys for that amount of time.
We do an about- face.
We bring the guys home.
Absolutely.
We don' t even know if the Odyssey' s engine' s working.
lf there' s been serious damage to this spacecraft --
That is not the argument!
- [All Arguing]
- I' m not gonna sugarcoat this for you!
Let' s hold it down.
The only engine with enough power for a direct abort... is the S. P. S. on the service module.
From what Lovell has told us, it could have been damaged in an explosion, so let' s consider that engine dead.
It' s just too risky.
We' re not gonna take that chance.
The command module is only good for reentry.
That leaves us with the LEM, which means free- return trajectory.
Once we get the guys around the moon, we' il fire up the LEM engine, make a long burn, pick up some speed and get 'em home as quick as we can.
Gene, I' m wondering what the Grumman guys think about this.
We can' t make any guarantees.
We designed the LEM to land on the moon, not fire the engine out there for course corrections.
Well, unfortunately, we' re not landing on the moon, are we?
I care about what it can do.
Let' s get to work.
Let' s lay it out, okay?
Flight, he says it will be ready in time.
After this burn, we' ve got to build time in the flight plan for them to sleep.
- Run it by the F. A. O. - I' ve run it by the F. A. O.
Do we know how long we' re gonna fire that burn?
He specifically wanted a quote from a flight director.
- Who wanted a quote?
- The President.
- The President?
- Nixon.
- [Sighs]
- We are not losing the crew.
Five to one against?
- Three to one?
- I don' t think they' re that good.
We are not losing those men!
- How long are they gonna have to burn the engine?
Look, tell him... three to one.
Expect loss of signal in less than one minute.
[Haise]
Roger that, Houston.
We' il hear from you again at acquisition of signal.
You wanna look?
Oh, look at that.
Aquarius, that' s 30 seconds until loss of signal.
Mare Tranquillitatis.
Neil and Buzz' s old neighborhood.
Comin 'up on Mount Marilyn.
Jim, you gotta take a look at this.
I' ve seen it.
Aquarius, this is Houston.
We expect loss of signal in approximately ten seconds.
So long, Earth.
Catch you on the flip side.
When you go into the shadow of the moon... and the moon is between you and the sun, then you see stars that are more brilliant than anything you' ve seen... on the clearest nights here on Earth.
And then you pass into the lunar sunrise over the lunar surface.
It must be an awe- inspiring sight.
l- l- I can' t wait to see it myself.
The problem now is not so much a question of an adequate oxygen supply, but it is the rate of consumption of water, which is vitally needed for the cooling operations... to maintain the electronic systems and so forth.
Look, it' s Fra Mauro.
I can see our landing site.
Look at the Tsiolkovskii crater.
I can' t believe how bright the ejecta blanket is.
It' s like snow.
It' s beautiful.
That' s Mare lmbrium to the north.
Thirteen, this is Houston.
We' re reading your telemetry.
It' s good to see you again.
[CAPCOM]
We are picking you up at a velocity of 7, 062 feet per second... at a distance from the moon of 56 nautical miles.
Stand by for your P. C. plus two burn data.
Gotta tell you, I had an itch to take this baby down, do some prospectin '.
Damn, we were close.
Gentlemen, what are your intentions?
I' d like to go home.
We got a burn coming up.
We' re gonna need a contingency if we lose comm with Houston.
Freddo, let' s get an idea where we stand on the consumables.
Jack, get into the Odyssey... and bag up all the water you can before it freezes in there.
Let' s go home.
Aquarius, we got some P. C. plus two burn data for you fellas.
So you' re telling me you can only give our guys 45 hours?
That brings them to about there.
Gentlemen, that' s not acceptable.
- Gene, we' ve got to talk about power.
Whoa, whoa, guys!
Power is everything!
What do you mean?
Without it, they don' t talk to us, they don' t correct their trajectory, they don' t turn the heat shield around.
We gotta turn everything off now.
- They' re not gonna make it to reentry.
- What do you mean, "everything"?
With everything on, the LEM draws 60 amps.
At that rate, in 16 hours the batteries are dead, not 45.
And so is the crew.
We gotta get them down to 12 amps.
- How many?
You can' t run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps, John.
We gotta turn off -- We have to turn off the radars, cabin heater, instrument displays, the guidance computer, the whole smash.
Guidance computer.
What if they need to do another burn?
They won' t even know which way they' re pointed.
The more time we talk, the more juice they waste.
- That' s the deal?
- That' s the deal.
Okay, John.
The minute we finish the burn, we' il power down the LEM.
All right.
Now in the meantime, we' re gonna have a frozen command module up there.
We' re gonna have to power it up using nothing but the reentry batteries.
- That' s never been tried.
- We' ve never even simulated it before.
Well, we' re gonna have to figure it out.
I want people in our simulators working reentry scenarios.
I want you guys to find every engineer who designed every switch, circuit, and light bulb that' s up there.
Then talk to the guy in the assembly line who actually built the thing.
Find out how to squeeze every amp out of both of these goddamn machines.
I want this mark all the way back to Earth with time to spare.
We never lost an American in space.
We' re sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch.
Failure is not an option.
Ken?
Huh?
- Good, you' re not dead.
I' ve been trying to get in touch with you for 45 minutes.
Jesus, John, what are you doing here?
I gotta get you in the simulators.
- What?
- There' s been an explosion.
Command module shut down.
- What about the crew?
- Crew' s fine so far.
Trying to keep them alive in the LEM.
We' re gonna have to shut that down pretty soon too.
We got a lot of people working the numbers on this one, Ken.
Nobody' s too sure how much power we' re gonna have when we hit reentry.
The command module' s gonna be frozen up pretty good by then.
You see this ammeter rise over 20 at any point, power- up is no good.
Our guys can' t reenter.
Okay?
How much power do we have to play with?
- Go.
- Yeah, Ken Mattingly just got here.
Copy.
He' s here.
They' ve been losing heat since the accident.
They' re gonna start getting water condensation on the control panels.
- Ken, you know what' s going on?
- John' s brought me up to speed.
- We don' t really know.
We gotta get started on some shortcuts for power- up.
You know how short?
- It' s all in the sequencing.
lf we can skip whatever we don' t absolutely need... and turn things on in the right order, maybe --
- You started on a procedure?
The engineers have tried, but it' s your ship.
- Okay.
Frank, I need the sim cold and dark.
Give me the exact same conditions they' ve got in there now.
And I need present status of every instrument.
I need a flashlight.
That' s not what they have up there.
Don' t give me anything they don' t have on board.
Put him in space, fellas.
Okay, Houston, the quad heater circuit breakers are open.
[CAPCOM]
We copy that, Thirteen.
Aquarius, we don' t want you to make any more waste dumps.
The venting may push you off course.
- Oh, Christ.
- [Swigert]
No more waste dumps.
We' re just gonna have to store it.
Jack, we' re gonna need some more urine bags.
Okay, Houston, that leaves us with just the computer, which I' m shutting down now.
And that' s it.
We just put Sir lsaac Newton in the driver' s seat.
ls it A. M. or P. M.?
A. M. Very, very A. M.
Haise is running a temperature, and none of them has slept.
I can' t order these guys to go to sleep.
- Could you sleep up there?
- It' s gonna get cold in there for them.
Gene, we have a situation brewing with the carbon dioxide.
We got a CO2 filter problem on the lunar module.
Five filters on the LEM.
Meant for two guys for a day and a half.
They' re already up to eight on the gauges.
Anything over 15 and you get... impaired judgment, blackouts, the beginnings of brain asphyxia.
What about the scrubbers on the command module?
- The ones on the LEM are round.
[Sighs]
Tell me this isn' t a government operation.
[Doctor]
Those CO2 levels are gonna be getting toxic.
Well, I suggest you gentlemen invent a way... to put a square peg in a round hole... rapidly.
Okay, people, listen up.
The people upstairs have handed us this one, and we gotta come through.
We gotta find a way to make this... fit into the hole for this... using nothing but that.
- Let' s get it organized.
- Okay, let' s build a filter.
Better get some coffee going too, someone.
The Haise family lives in El Lago, Texas.
His wife, Mary, is from Biloxi, Mississippi.
When Fred Haise was growing up in Biloxi, he may have looked ahead to a fine family, but he never dreamt of flying.
- Good morning.
- Henry.
Don' t you ever sleep?
I have a request from the news people.
They want to put a transmitter up on the lawn.
Transmitter?
It' s kind of a tower for a live broadcast.
I thought they didn' t care about this mission.
They didn' t even run Jim' s show.
Well... it' s more dramatic now.
Suddenly people are --
lf landing on the moon wasn' t dramatic enough, why should not landing be?
Look, I, um, realize how hard this is, Marilyn, but the whole world is caught up in it.
- It' s the biggest story since -- - No, Henry.
Those people don' t put one piece of equipment on my lawn.
lf they have a problem with that, they can take it up with my husband.
He' il be home on Friday.
And have no place to go
Hey, Freddo.
It' s too cold in there.
That' s a nice one of Mary.
- You don' t look too good, Freddo.
- I' il survive.
- There' s aspirin in the medical kit.
- I took some.
Jim, I' m all right.
It was an accident, Mary gettin 'pregnant.
You should have seen the look on my face when she told me.
Well, that has a tendency to happen.
Yeah.
I wonder if it' s a boy or a girl.
You' re gonna find out soon enough.
Sure.
I never dreamed I' d ever get to do something like this: come up here on a real mission.
Most of the guys I graduated high school with... never even left home, and here I am.
[Sighing]
Oh, yeah... here you are.
It hurts when I urinate.
Well, you' re not gettin 'enough water.
I' m drinking my ration the same as you.
I think old Swigert gave me the clap.
- He' s been pissin 'in my relief tube.
Well... that will be a hot one at the debriefing for the flight surgeon.
- That' s another first for America' s space program.
Listen, um...
I' ve been going... over some stuff, and I' m a little worried about this cold affecting our battery efficiency.
[Lovell]
It could cost us amp hours on the back end?
- That' s a possibility.
- I' ve been goin 'over the numbers again.
Have they called up with a reentry plan yet?
Hold on.
I can' t remember the ratio to temperature.
We got no references on board.
Listen!
They gave us too much Delta V. They had us burn too long.
At this rate we' re gonna skip out of the atmosphere and never get back.
What are you talkin 'about?
- How' d you figure that?
- I can add.
They' ve got half the Ph. D. s on the planet working on this.
Houston says we' re on the money.
What if they made a mistake and there was no way to reverse it?
There' s no reason for them to tell us!
What do you mean?
That' s bullshit!
There' s a thousand things that have to happen in order.
We are on number eight.
You' re talking about number 692.
ln the meantime, I' m trying to tell you we' re coming in too fast.
I think they know it, and that' s why we don' t have a goddamn reentry plan.
Thank you, Jack.
- Ow!
- Hey!
This piece of shit' s gonna get you home.
That' s because that' s the only thing we got left, Jack!
- What are you saying, Fred?
- I think you know what I' m saying.
Now wait a minute.
All I did was stir those tanks.
What was that gauge reading before you hit the switch?
- You don' t know, do you?
They brought me in to do a job!
They asked me to stir the tanks, and I stirred the tanks!
- Stop kicking yourself in the ass.
- This is not my fault!
No one is saying it is.
lf I' m in the left- hand seat when the call comes up, I stir the tanks.
- Yeah, well, tell him that.
- and you don' t know!
- Look, we are not gonna do this.
We' re not gonna go bouncing off the walls for ten minutes... because we' re just gonna end up right back here with the same problems!
Try to figure out how to stay alive!
- [Shouts]
Are we on VOX?
[Calmly]
Go ahead.
[CAPCOM]
Yeah, Jim, could you check your CO2 gauge for us?
Yeah, Houston, we were just looking at that.
That can' t be right.
I went over those numbers three times.
Jim, that sounds about right.
We were expecting that.
That' s very comforting, Houston.
[CAPCOM]
We' re working on a procedure down here for you.
- Do you copy?
- Oh, Christ.
All right, Houston, we' re standing by for those procedures.
Christ, I know why my numbers are wrong.
I only figured it for two people.
Maybe I should just hold my breath.
- Heads up.
Heads up.
- Someone get that.
Heads up, people.
Look out now.
- What' s this?
- That' s what they gotta make.
- Right here.
That' s it?
All right, Aquarius, this is Houston.
Do you have a flight plan?
Affirmative, Andy.
Jack' s got one right here.
Okay, we have an unusual procedure for you here.
We need you to rip the cover off.
[Laughs]
With pleasure.
- a lithium hydroxide canister -- - Two, two.
I' m sorry.
- Duct tape.
[CAPCOM]
Duct tape.
The red suit hoses, and you' ve got the flight plan cover.
What about their level of carbon dioxide?
It' s, uh, climbing.
Wait a second.
That' s not what he said.
He said we' re working on it.
You want to cut the duct tape three feet long.
- Just use your arm.
- It' s a good arm length.
- I see what you' re getting at.
Hold on.
- [CAPCOM]
All right?
- Hold on, Houston.
While the astronauts appear to have enough oxygen to keep them alive, one thing they have too much of is carbon dioxide.
With each breath, the three men expel... more of the poisonous gas into the lunar module cockpit, and the scrubbers intended to keep the atmosphere breathable... are quickly becoming saturated.
Oh, shit.
I tore it.
Houston, what do we do if we ripped the bag?
Can we tape it?
- Oh, no.
Uh, stand by.
What should I tell 'em to do?
They should have one more.
But they' ve still got a long way to come.
They are now working on their backup facilities, their emergency facilities.
The problem is, if anything more goes wrong, they' re in real trouble.
As most of you are aware, there is no rescue possible in space flight.
Any rescue system the space agency has long since calculated --
- [CAPCOM]
Once you have the sock in place,
- we' re gonna want you to bungee...
- Work it in. the entire filter assembly to the bulkhead,
- We' re getting close to 15.
So how does this flight compare to other emergency situations you' ve faced?
- [Haise]
Houston, filter' s in place.
- Cabin gas return to egress.
Suit circuit relief to close.
- CO2 canister select to secondary.
- Here goes.
I can hear air moving.
Just breathe normal, fellas.
Aquarius, please advise on CO2 status.
Yeah, Houston, we' re taking a look at those numbers now.
We' re still holding close to 15, Houston.
Standing by.
Houston, the CO2 level has dropped to nine... and it is still falling.
That is good to hear, Aquarius.
And you, sir, are a steely- eyed missile man.
Okay, spacecraft control to computer.
- [Buzzing]
- We overloaded.
We used way too much power.
There must be a sneak circuit between step seven and ten.
- Which one has the leak?
- Don' t know that yet, John.
We have to go back and try 'em one at a time.
You need a break, Ken?
lf they don' t get one, I don' t get one.
Well, if it won' t work, get me another one.
- My son' s supposed to be on.
- I know, Mrs. Lovell.
- Hi, Blanch.
- They can' t fix a thing in this place.
Blanch, it' s Marilyn.
Hi, Grandma.
- I was gonna see Jimmy.
- I know.
We came to tell you something.
There' s been an accident.
Jimmy' s okay.
But he' s not gonna get to walk on the moon.
Well, they said he was.
I know.
Um... that was before.
Now there' s been an explosion, and they' re all okay.
They' re all right.
But now they' re just going to... try to figure out a way to get them home.
And it' s a little bit dangerous.
Oh, sweetie.
Are you scared?
Well, don' t you worry, honey.
lf they could get a washing machine to fly, my Jimmy could land it.
Without a love of my own
[CAPCOM]
Jack, you' il be happy to hear we contacted President Nixon, and he' s gonna grant you an extension on your income taxes... since you are most decidedly out of the country.
[Sniffs]
That' s wonderful news.
Tell them they have to sleep.
Haise is running a fever of 104.
Thirteen, we' ve had another request from the flight surgeon... that you fellas get more sleep.
He doesn' t like his readings down here.
Let' s see how he feels about this.
I am sick and tired of the entire western world... knowing how my kidneys are functioning!
- [Steady Tone Continues]
Uh, Thirteen, this is Houston.
Jim, we just had a dropout on your bio- med sensors.
I' m not wearing my bio- med sensors, Houston.
Okay, Jim.
Copy that.
- Now I' m losing all three of 'em!
It' s just a little medical mutiny, Doc.
I' m sure the guys are still with us.
Let' s cut 'em some slack, okay?
It' s not the velocity, it' s the angle.
Maybe they' re still venting something that' s throwing off the trajectory, but we are definitely shallowing again.
- We are up to a 5. 9.
- Damn it.
At this rate, they nick the Earth' s atmosphere and bounce off into space.
We need another burn to get them back in the corridor.
Copy that.
- Fire the engines and get 'em on course.
Aquarius, this is Houston.
Jim, we' ve got another course correction for you.
What' s up?
Something about another course correction.
Uh, we copy, Houston.
[CAPCOM]
Negative on that, Jim.
We can' t spare power for the computer.
We gotta do this blind?
Without the computer, what do we use for orientation?
We' ve got to be able to give these guys something.
Without the power, we can' t give them a reading.
I' m not talking about power, I' m talking about reference.
No, there' s no references.
We have debris up there.
Houston, what' s the story with this burn?
We' re trying to hash something out down here, Aquarius.
Stand by.
Look, Houston.
All we need to hold attitude is one fixed point in space.
- [CAPCOM]
Yeah.
Well, Houston, we' ve got one.
lf we can keep the Earth in the window, flying manually, the co- ax crosshairs right on its terminator, all I have to know is: how long do we need to burn the engine?
- [CAPCOM]
Roger that, Jim.
Can they fly it manually and still shut it down... on time without the computer?
I guess that' s the best we can do.
We' re out of time.
ln order to enter the atmosphere safely, the crew must aim for a corridor just two and a half degrees wide.
lf they' re too steep, they' il incinerate in the steadily thickening air.
lf they' re too shallow, they' il ricochet... off the atmosphere like a rock skipping off a pond.
The reentry corridor is, in fact, so narrow... that if this basketball were the Earth... and this softball were the moon, and the two were placed 14 feet apart, the crew would have to hit a target no thicker than this piece of paper.
Okay, people, on your toes.
We' re doing this one blind.
Gene, I want you to understand we' ve never tried this before: burn, cold soak, burn, cold soak, burn, manual control.
- [Sighs]
I just want you to know the engine' s never been tried like this.
- [Sighs]
I know what you' re trying to do.
I won' t hold you personally responsible.
lf it lights, it lights.
Let Lovell do the rest.
They' re gonna burn the engines and steer it manually, attempting to keep the Earth in the window.
Okay, this is gonna take all three of us.
you handle the pitch.
Put on the translation controllers, all backwards.
you need to thrust aft, not forward.
I' il do the same on mine with everything else.
We' re going to burn at ten percent thrust for 39 seconds.
- Jack, you time us.
- Got it.
Give us a count of the last ten seconds up to 39.
Let' s not miss this.
You up to this, Freddo?
I' m with you.
Standing by for corridor control burn.
Okay, Jim, you can fire when ready.
You are go for the manual burn.
Mark.
[Pushes Button]
Come on, baby.
One more burn.
- Nine, eight, seven, six, five,
- four, three, - Ullage is go. two, one, ignition!
- Oh, yeah.
- Master arm off.
- Okay, here we go.
Helium regulator on.
R. C. S. is go, ten percent thrust.
- Bring her around, Freddo.
- Ten seconds.
- [Lovell]
All right, drop it down, Freddo.
We' re driftin '!
- I' il roll it.
Back off.
- I can' t get it stable.
She' s dancin 'all over the place!
- Fifteen seconds.
[Haise]
She' s driftin '.
[Lovell]
Hold it right there.
That' s it.
- Shit!
I' m losin 'it!
- Bring the Earth up.
Come on.
Forward.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Helium regulator' s closed.
Bring it down, Freddo.
Just nose it down.
- Thirty seconds.
- [Lovell]
Ease your touch!
She' s comin 'in.
Damn it, that' s mine.
That' s me.
Come on, baby.
Hold it.
Damn it!
- Back!
That' s it!
Hold it!
Steady. -... seven, eight, nine!
[Shuts Off Thrusters]
Houston, we have shutdown.
That' s close enough, Jim.
Good work.
I knew it!
How about that LEM, huh?
How about it?
- You betcha.
Thirteen, stand by.
We' re evaluating our power usage on that burn.
Well, let' s hope we don' t have to do that again.
Gentlemen, you' ve given our guys enough to survive 'til reentry.
Well done.
Now we gotta get 'em in, so tell me about the power- up procedures.
Here' s the order of what I want to do.
I want to power up Guidance, E. C. S., Communications, warm up the pyros for the parachutes and the command module thrusters.
The thrusters are gonna put you over budget on amps.
They' ve been sitting at 200 below for four days.
Fine.
Then trade off the parachutes, something.
Well, if the chutes don' t open, what' s the point?
You' re telling me what you need.
I' m telling you what we have to work.
- I' m not making this stuff up.
- They will need all these systems, John.
We do not have the power, Ken.
We just don' t have it.
Okay, I' m gonna go back and reorganize the sequencing again... and find more power.
Let' s start from scratch.
Clear the board.
I don' t know where the hell we' re gonna find it.
[Lovell]
I' ve had an engine flame out a few times in an aircraft... and was curious as to whether it was going to light up again, things of that nature, but, uh, they seem to work out.
ls there an instance in an airplane emergency when you can recall fear?
I remember one time, I' m in a Banshee at night in combat conditions, so there' s no running lights on the carrier.
It was the Shangri- la, and we were in the Sea of Japan.
My radar had jammed, and my homing signal was gone... because somebody in Japan was actually using the same frequency, and so it was leading me away from where I was supposed to be.
I' m looking down at a big, black ocean, so I flip on my map light.
Then, suddenly, zap, everything shorts out right there in my cockpit.
I can' t even tell what my altitude is.
I know I' m running out of fuel, so I' m thinking about ditching into the ocean.
I look down there and then, in the darkness, there' s this, uh, there' s this green trail.
It' s like a long carpet that' s laid out beneath me.
It was the algae.
It was that phosphorescent stuff that gets churned up in the wake of a ship.
It was, it was, it was just leading me home.
Now, if my cockpit lights hadn' t shorted out, there' s no way I' d have ever been able to see that.
So, uh, you, uh, you never know... what, what events are going to transpire to get you home.
Spacecraft commander Jim Lovell, no stranger to emergencies.
- How' s it going, Fred?
- What the hell was that?
Let' s hope it was just the burst disk.
[CAPCOM]
We confirm that.
Houston, is that going to affect our, uh, entry angle at all?
Uh, negative.
Your entry angle is holding at 6. 24, Aquarius.
Houston, uh... we, we sure could use... the reentry procedure up here.
When can we expect that?
Uh, that' s coming real soon, Aquarius.
We just can' t throw this together at the last minute.
So, here' s what you' re gonna do.
You' re gonna get the procedure up to us, whatever it is, and we' re gonna go over it step by step, so there' s no foul- ups.
I don' t have to tell you we' re all a little tired up here.
The world' s getting awfully big in the window.
- Jim, this is Deke.
- It' s Deke.
They don' t know how to do it.
- Maybe Jack' s right.
What' s the story?
We' re gonna get that power- up procedure to you.
We' re gonna get it as soon as we possibly can.
Ken Mattingly' s in the simulator right now.
Ken' s working on it?
- Look...
I know this sequence works, John.
The sequence looks good.
- [Mattingly]
By how much?
- Three or four amps.
Goddamn it, John!
ls it three or four?
- Four.
- Four!
[Sighs]
We know they have some power left in the LEM batteries, right?
[Arthur]
Right.
- I' m listening.
- So... reverse it.
Reverse the flow and see if we can draw these four amps... from the LEM batteries before we cut it lose.
- Why can' t we do that?
- Do we have a procedure for that?
You' re gonna lose a lot in the transfer, Ken.
Yeah, yeah, but all we' re talking about here is four amps.
I want whatever you guys got on these power procedures.
Gene, they' re already --
I don' t want the whole bible, just a couple of chapters.
- We' ve got to get something up to them.
- They' re working on it.
I' il call the simulator and get an estimate.
Goddamn it!
I don' t want another estimate!
I want the procedures, now!
- [Mattingly]
How am I reading?
- Fine, so far.
- You' re under the limit.
Keep going.
Okay.
Floodlights to fixed.
Okay, I' m bringing up the guidance.
C. M. C. attitude l. M. U.
C. M. C. source.
C. M. C. mode, auto, and we' re on the computer.
- Go ahead.
- ls your computer on now?
Up and running.
How do we look?
I think we got it, buddy.
Arthur, my notes are clear on that last sequence, right?
- I was getting a little blurry there.
[lndistinct Chattering]
Here' s Ken.
Here' s John.
It' s good to see you, Ken.
- [Kranz]
We didn' t have time.
Aquarius, Houston.
Do you read?
Yeah, we read you, Ken.
Are the flowers blooming in Houston?
Uh, that' s a negative, Jim.
I don' t have the measles.
- Jim, is Jack in there with you?
Uh, yeah, stand by one.
We gotta get him on comm.
- Oh, damn it.
Thanks, Jackie.
I think it would really help if you could... just distract her when the heavy predictions come in.
We' il give it a shot.
- Thanks.
Blanch, these nice, young men are gonna watch the television with you.
This is Neil Armstrong, and this is Buzz Aldrin.
- Hi.
- Are you boys in the space program too?
Okay, Jack, give me a read- back on that last procedure.
Uh, stand by, Ken.
Ken, I' m having trouble reading my own writing.
I guess I was a little more tired than I thought.
Uh, don' t worry, Jack.
I' il talk you through it.
Okay, find the main bus breakers on panel 11.
Yeah, main bus breakers.
- Got it.
- [Mattingly]
Ken, there' s an awful lot of condensation on these panels.
What' s the word on these things shorting out?
Uh, we' il just take that one at a time, Jack.
It' s like tryin 'to drive a toaster through a car wash.
Main bus B is closed.
[FlDO]
Flight, we' re still shallowing up a bit in the reentry corridor.
It' s almost like they' re underweight.
- Now how could they be underweight?
- We didn' t land on the moon.
- Rocks?
- That' s affirm.
Uh, one more thing, Jim.
While Jack' s working on the power- up, we' d like you and Freddo... to transfer some ballast over to the command module.
Ballast?
Um, that' s affirm.
We got to get the weight right.
We were expecting you to be toting a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks.
Right, Houston.
- [Swigert]
Yeah, go ahead, Ken.
Okay, now, uh, panel five.
Circuit breaker caution and warning main B closed.
- [Alarm Buzzing]
- Master alarm off.
Okay, Jack, uh, on panel seven, B- MAG number two, power to warm- up.
- [Flicks Switch]
Sequential logic one and two on.
Sequential logic... two on.
C. M. R. C. S. pressure on.
[Swigert]
C. M. R. C. S. pressurization.
As her husband prepares to jettison his lunar module lifeboat,
Marilyn Lovell waits with her children, her neighbors... and, we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.
Only the Lovell' s eldest son, Jay, is absent... as he holds vigil with his classmates... at the St. Johns Military Academy in Wisconsin.
ABC News science editor Jules Bergman.
With a crippled command module, and surviving by using the LEM' s systems, there can be no easy maneuver.
Their LEM lifeboat is doing things and working longer... than it was ever intended to.
[Mattingly]
Okay, Jack, we' re ready to see if the computer will accept... uplink of the reentry data now. uplink of the reentry data now.
- [Swigert]
We got our eight- balls back.
- [Mattingly]
Okay, Ken, uh, uplink telemetry, command module to accept, right?
That' s affirm.
Go ahead and try it.
Come on.
Uplink completed.
- Yeah.
- [Men Chattering]
How we doin '?
[Sighs]
Boy, I wish you were here to see it.
- I' il bet you do.
Way to go, Jack.
Go, RETRO.
Flight, we are looking at a typhoon warning...
- on the edge of the prime recovery zone.
- Say again, RETRO.
We are looking at a typhoon warning on the edge of the prime recovery area.
This is just a warning.
It could miss them.
Only if their luck changes.
Jim, we' re ready for S. M. jettison!
All right, Jack, on three!
One... two...
- upward thrust.
- We' re loose!
- Reverse thrust!
[Lovell]
Okay, Houston, service module is free.
We' re gonna take a look at what we have here.
Copy that.
There it is.
I see it!
Houston, we' re getting our first look at the service module now.
One whole side of the spacecraft is missing.
Right by the high gain antennae a whole panel is blown out, right up, right up to our heat shield.
Uh, copy that, Aquarius.
Can you see that?
Oh, man, that' s incredible.
The heat shield.
The heat will build up to as much as 3, 000 or 4, 000 degrees Fahrenheit.
On a lunar reentry flight, the heat approaches 4, 000 degrees.
So, uh, Blanch?
Did Jim make Eagle Scout or not?
- He did.
[TV]
lf the heat shield is even slightly cracked, the extreme cold could have split it wide open.
[Cronkite]
Perhaps never in human history... has the entire world been united by such a global drama.
ln New York City, thousands of people have gathered... to watch updates of the mission in Times Square.
Many countries offered help, and the State Department said... it would ask for it if it were needed.
[Cronkite]
ln Rome, Pope Paul led 50, 000 people... in prayers for the safe return of the astronauts.
ln Jerusalem, prayers at the Wailing Wall.
Uh, it' s about time to bail out of this ship, Freddo.
Freddo?
You okay?
I' m, uh -- I' m freezing.
Can you hold out just a little longer?
- Long as I have to.
- Aw, come on.
It won' t be long.
Just a little while longer, Freddo.
Just a little while longer.
We' re gonna hit that water in the South Pacific.
- [Shivering]
- It' s 80 degrees out there.
- Eighty degrees.
- You are a mess.
- [Chuckling]
Odyssey, Houston.
Uh, how we doin ', guys?
We' re closing in on lunar module jettison.
As you know, that is time- critical.
We should be making our move into the command module.
[Lovell]
Roger that.
- Here, let me give you a hand there, Freddo.
We' re coming up on LEM jettison.
ls everyone strapped in, Ken?
We' re getting real close.
Copy that, Flight.
Thirteen, Houston.
We' re coming up on LEM jettison.
Stand by.
Have you got everybody in the Odyssey?
[Swigert]
Okay, the pyro batts look good.
I don' t think we' re gonna have to tie the other batteries.
Sorry, Jack, it' s an old habit.
She' s yours to fly.
Okay, Odyssey, I want to double- check some reentry procedures... right after we jettison the LEM, which is coming up in 30 seconds.
What is that?
Oh, I was getting a little punchy, and I didn' t want to cut the LEM loose with you guys still in it.
That' s good thinking.
Stand by, Houston.
We have lunar module jettison.
She sure was a good ship.
Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.
It' s almost time, honey.
[Crewman]
Let me put it this way.
Their thrusters may be frozen.
Their guidance system might be malfunctioning.
Their heat shield could be cracked.
And their parachutes might be three blocks of ice.
Clearly, we have some obstacles to overcome.
Okay, but now I' m asking you, when will we know?
Well, blackout lasts for three minutes.
lf they' re not back in four, we' il know.
Velocity now reading 34, 802 feet per second.
- Range to go 2, 625 nautical miles.
[Sighs]
Okay, Ken, we are aligned for reentry.
Fred, how are the batteries looking?
[Haise Sighs]
Batt A looks good.
- Batt B:
No volts, the amps are okay. - and 30 seconds.
Batt C:
Shit, no volts, only two amps.
Roger.
Let' s tie all the batteries onto main A and main B.
Flight, they' re still shallowing a bit up there.
Do you want to tell 'em?
- [RETRO]
Not now, Flight.
Copy that.
RETRO says the typhoon is still a presence in the splashdown area?
- Yeah.
- We got the parachute situation, the heat shield, the angle of trajectory and the typhoon.
There' s so many variables, I' m at a loss --
I know what the problems are.
This could be the worst disaster NASA' s ever experienced.
With all due respect, sir, I believe this is going to be our finest hour.
Expect entry interface in 45 seconds.
And on my mark, your velocity... will be 35, 245 feet per second.
35 seconds to entry interface.
Gentlemen... it' s been a privilege flying with you.
Flight, we have loss of radio contact.
Roger that.
Expect to regain signal in three minutes.
It all depends on the heat shield.
Back to the lwo Jima and our live cameras there.
[Reporter]
Coming up now on three minutes until time of drogue deployment.
Standing by for any reports of acquisition.
One minute and 30 seconds to end of blackout.
No reentering ship has ever taken longer... than three minutes to emerge from blackout.
This is the critical moment.
Will the heat shield hold?
Will the command module survive the intense heat of reentry?
lf it doesn' t, there' il only be silence.
- Mommy, you' re squishing me.
- Oops, sorry, sweetie.
It' s okay.
Okay, Flight, that' s three minutes.
- We are standing by for acquisition.
- Copy that.
Do you read me?
Expected time of reacquisition, the time when the astronauts were expected to come out of blackout, has come and gone.
About all any of us can do now is just listen and hope.
We' re about to learn whether or not that heat shield, which was damaged by the explosion three days ago, has withstood the inferno of reentry.
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?
Three minutes, 30 seconds.
Standing by.
Odyssey, Houston.
Odyssey, this is Houston.
That' s four minutes.
Standing by.
Odyssey, uh, Houston.
Do you read?
Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.
- It' s good to see you again.
Odyssey, Houston.
Welcome home.
We' re glad to see you.
Good job.
- Thank you.
They made it.
Houston, we' re at stable one.
The ship is secure.
This is Apollo 13 signing off.
- Good job.
Our mission was called a successful failure, in that we returned safely but never made it to the moon.
ln the following months, it was determined... that a damaged coil built inside the oxygen tank... sparked during our cryo stir and caused the explosion that crippled the Odyssey.
It was a minor defect that occurred two years... before I was even named the flight' s commander.
Fred Haise was going back to the moon on Apollo 18, but his mission was canceled because of budget cuts.
He never flew in space again.
Nor did Jack Swigert, who left the astronaut corps... and was elected to Congress from the state of Colorado.
But he died of cancer before he was able to take office.
Ken Mattingly orbited the moon as command module pilot of Apollo 16... and flew the space shuttle, having never gotten the measles.
Gene Kranz retired as Director of Flight Operations just not long ago.
And many other members of Mission Control have gone on to other things, but some are still there.
And as for me... the seven extraordinary days of Apollo 13 were my last in space.
I watched other men walk on the moon and return safely, all from the confines of Mission Control and our house in Houston.
I sometimes catch myself looking up at the moon, remembering the changes of fortune in our long voyage, thinking of the thousands of people who worked to bring the three of us home.
I look up at the moon and wonder... when will we be going back... and who will that be? "Takas ve satýþ için vcddivx@ hotmail. com"
We have seen a star in the east.
It told us the Son of God is born.
Nativity Play/ Sermon/ Dinner
The Lord Jesus was laid in a manger...... to bring salvation to the souls of those...... with no place of their own.
Nothing is harder than to have no place...... but many are those without one.
Tell me about it!
In their solitude, they long for someone who will say:
"I want you to be here."
Not me, thanks.
Be quiet!
Jesus was born to offer those alone a place in which to be alive!
"Joy to the world, the food has come."
Gin!
It' s "the Lord has come"!
You don' t know much, do you?
More than some faggot.
I am a mistake made by God.
In my heart, I am a woman.
Women can have children.
What if a miracle like the Virgin Mary getting pregnant...... was to happen to a homo?
Better give me a little extra.
After all, I' m eating for two.
Serves you right!
Miyuki!
Time to eat!
Miyuki!
Close your legs!
Act like you were a woman.
I am a woman.
And it' s a waste to spill food like that.
Don' t just gobble your bread.
Eat it with love for the people who made and brought it here.
I hate that Bible- thumping.
You' re just like Akiko.
Who' s Akiko?
My old lady.
Well!
Don' t call your mother that.
Eat shit, you old fart.
"Shit" I' il take, but "fart" I won' t!
That hurts!
You old...... "bag lady."
You peep pretty loud for a chick that can' t even find its own worms.
Should a burden on society like you be talking?
You' re a burden on us.
What does that make you?
The kettle the pot' s calling black!
You mouthy brat!
Can' t you at least get along at Christmas?
Oh, yes....
Miyuki, I got you a present.
They' re gone!
A whole set of "World Literature for Children."
Why would I need that?!
Hana looked hard for those!
Even a homeless teenage runaway needs a Christmas present!
I choose not to go home.
Six months on the street means you don' t have a home.
I can go home any time I want to.
It' s the ones who say that who never do.
Speak for yourself, you old geezer!
What are you doing to Dostoevsky?!
I won' t take that, today of all days!
Not even my father ever hit me!
So I' il do it for him!
Grow up, will you?!
Don' t hurt yourselves.
Show more respect, kid!
I' m not a kid!
With little tits like these?
You filthy old pervert!
That' s harassment!
Will you two stop!
Huh?
It' s been...... abandoned.
There, there, there.
Care for this child.
What a world!
Oh, man!
Oh, my!
You' re a little girl.
I wonder what your name is.
"John Doe."
She' s a girl, I said!
He' s so rude!
How old was I when I started living like this?
Thirty- something?
I still thought that I was better off...... than a child with no home.
There, there, now!
We' il take you somewhere warm.
The cop shop' s that way!
This is a Christmas present from God!
She' s our baby!
Huh?

Sorry!
What do you mean, take her with us?
I' m just doing God' s will.
Her parents might come back.
What parent would leave a child out in this cold?!
That' s a devil, not a parent!
Kiyoko wanted us to find her.
"Kiyoko"?
"Kiyoko"?
Why "Kiyoko"?!
From kiyo, "pure," on this purest of nights.
How tacky!
Kiyoko' s a fine name!
Did you have a girlfriend named that?
Idiot!
Look, we can' t just name her!
She' s not a puppy or a kitten!
So I' m taking her home.
To a cardboard box?
There' s no room!
This is a once- in- a- lifetime chance!
Let me feel like a mother!
A haiku:
"A little baby / powdery snow on its cheeks / on this holy night."
Directed by Satoshi Kon
Peek- a- boo!
Oh, dear!
Tell me what' s wrong!
Shut up!
Hey!
I know, I know, he' s not your mommy.
He' s just a homeless homo.
Don' t say that in front of her!
A baby crying around here will sound weird!
We' re going to take you to the police soon, okay?
You' re not going anywhere, are you?
Idiot!
We' re taking her to the police!
Don' t shout or she' il never shut up!
Why won' t you stop crying?
Are you hungry?
There, there!
Maybe she' s sick.
Tomorrow....
I promise I' il take her then.
Christmas should be the happiest day of the year.
If we take her in now, it' il always be the worst day of her life!
Maybe...... she needs a diaper.
Hana, boil some water.
I' il make some milk.
Hey!
Whose side are you on?!
Go buy some water!
My angel isn' t drinking from the tap!
Why me?
Where does a bum get off telling me "Them that works eats"?
Just for tonight, remember.
Tomorrow we take her to the police.
So "no man is an island" after all, huh?
You' re buying water?!
A Christmas miracle.
What a haul!
Watch where you' re going, brat!
You watch where you' re going!
I was married once.
With a child?
No, don' t tell me!
I don' t want to hear this!
You never forget for one second.
A child' s the only thing you hold dearer than life itself.
A boy?
No.
Bullshit!
Come on!
Give it back!
Hey, you' re the girl who hangs out with Gin.
Get out of here, will you?
We don' t want Gin after us.
Why not?
You' re the light of his life, that' s why not!
There' s not much light in a cardboard box.
Let me have this book.
How old?
Twenty- one, I think.
Five or six years older than Miyuki, I guess.
That old?
If she was alive.
When I was 20 I got a girl pregnant, and we got married.
I was in heaven.
You could have poked me in the eye and I' d have just smiled at you.
But my daughter got sick, and the medical bills were huge.
I was something of a bicycle racer then.
I needed money.
There was this race....
You threw it?
A punk I knew had this scheme.
They found out, I got kicked out of racing, and my girl died.
I just didn' t feel like working anymore.
And then my wife followed my daughter.
Oh, no!
That' s how you get to be a man like me.
I didn' t want to hear that!
I hate sad stories!
It' s freezing!
You' re used to this.
Kind of.
I' il give her the milk.
Dreams do come true.
I always dreamed of being the mother of a little girl.
A nice, warm house, a pretty daughter.
Even if my husband was no good...... I would accept dire poverty as long as I had my child.
Feed the poor kid!
You' re so pretty.
The prettiest little girl in the world.
What do you want?!
They' re gone.
Santa Claus, maybe?
"Uncle Bag" and the baby are gone.
What' s that faggot thinking about?!
Man, he' s got big feet!
You can' t have feet fixed.
Are you taking her back?
There' s probably an APB out on her.
And for you.
I doubt it.
An arrest warrant, maybe.
Her parents are probably sorry about this now.
So let' s take her to the police.
A baby' s always better off with its real mother.
Not necessarily.
Sometimes a foster mother' s better.
- What?!
- Don' t be stupid.
I never knew my real mother.
But I' il bet if she saw me now, she' d flip.
How can someone homeless raise a child?
I know, I know!
I don' t want her shunted from one foster home to another...... without even one memory...... of ever having been loved.
You don' t have to be a foundling to feel that.
They must have had reasons.
Nothing should make you abandon a child!
That means you' ve taken love and tossed it away, like trash.
Yeah, but what can we do about it?
Find her mother.
And ask why she abandoned her baby.
If she can make me understand...... I' il forgive her, and my mother too.
Find her?
How?
We' il have to pay again.
This is an expensive year- end!
What if we find another baby?
They don' t toss them out in twos.
Another key!
Look at these panties.
You' d catch cold in them!
Are they the ones?
Are these your folks?
Look, business cards.
A hostess club won' t be open at this hour!
We' ve got some walking to do.
You' ve gotta be kidding!
He was eating for two!
But why pack like you' re off on a trip and then abandon a baby?
Maybe it was one last trip they were taking.
A family suicide?!
Then what do we do?
We can' t search the next world!
Shh!
We apologize for any inconvenience.
Trains will be delayed due to heavy snowfall.
It' s so hot in here!
What a stink!
Have you bathed lately?
No.
Or washed my clothes.
How embarrassing!
Oh, dear!
There, there.
Did she piss herself?
That' s why it stinks!
Quiet!
Shut that kid up!
Watch it!
Hey!
Miyuki!
What' s she up to?
We wasted our train fares!
It was me who paid them.
I' m sorry!
There' s no more milk.
Go ahead, blame it all on me.
Oh, cheer up!
Let' s sing a song.
What' s that?
The Sound of Music, of course.
Never heard of it.
That' s going to make you even hungrier.
I' m starving!
I told you!
Look after my little angel.
Go on without me.
Just say you' il never forget the queer you once knew.
Look.
A cemetery.
I' m not dead yet!
Now I' m alive again!
But there' s nothing for a baby in these offerings to the dead!
We' il get by!
Yeah, sure!
"We' il get by!"
People keep on saying that till they end up living like us!
And while we keep on saying it, the kid' il end up under a stone here.
"Kiyoko"!
She has a name!
Yeah, whatever.
And she' s cute.
She' s so pretty.
But listen to me.
I' m serious.
You listening?
If you really care about that kid...... you' il find her someone to take care of her.
I speak from experience.
That' s what her parents said, I bet.
What do you mean?
I wouldn' t abandon a kid.
Don' t be stupid!
No.
Your family abandoned you!
There you go again!
Am I going to sit and listen...... while some dumb faggot pisses on me?
What are we doing here?
Tell me.
Wracking our brains!
We' re scavenging offerings left in a cemetery.
And why?
Because we' re homeless.
- Stop it!
- No!
I' m not going to stop.
We are three good- for- nothing bums...... who can' t even look after ourselves.
Shut up!
I' m thinking!
I won' t shut up.
You can' t get milk from an old queer' s tits, no matter how hard you think.
Come on, Hana!
You know we can' t do this.
Speak for yourself!
This way the whole family will be dead.
Oh, my!
You' re so lucky, Kiyoko!
God must really love you!
Then why was she...... dumped?
Left!
- That' s a dead end!
- It' s right!
- Tails.
- Heads.
What' s this guy doing parking like that?
Doesn' t he know what a "public thoroughfare" is?
How did that happen?
Bad luck.
The car got stuck, and I forgot the parking brake.
Then someone shouted, "Dorothy, wait!"...... and then I heard, "Whoops!"...... and the damn car rolled on top of me.
I don' t bring my men with me when I' m visiting the old man' s grave.
I owe you.
Call me if you' re ever in trouble.
Oh, no, we never have any trouble.
You' re from Kinshicho?
We were just going there.
I know it' s rude to ask....
If it' s rude, then don' t ask.
Come on.
Would you know this establishment?
"Midori"
Know it?
Its owner' s marrying my daughter today.
He' s one of my men, but he' s too cocky.
I was against it.
But your daughter chose him.
The daughter I brought up, married to a man like that....
Know what I mean?
But if your daughter' s happy with him...... isn' t that the main thing?
You' re right!
I went to the old man' s grave so I wouldn' t cry at the wedding.
Watch the road!
Good evening, sir!
Make yourselves at home.
Daddy, you' re late!
Sorry, sorry.
I almost got killed.
I owe them my life.
My daughter, Kiyoko.
Oh.
Hello.
What have you gotten us into?!
Just shut up and eat!
Diaper change.
Your turn, Miyuki.
Don' t you think Kiyoko has amazing luck?
Yeah.
Maybe she does.
Oh, yeah.
Her name' s Sachiko.
Not "Midori"?
Just at the club.
She' s Sachiko, "happy child," though she didn' t look it.
But some plastic surgery turned her into a good little earner.
She quit.
Said she was pregnant.
Do you know where she is?
I doubt you' il wring any money out of her.
No, I have something to give her.
I' m sorry I spilled your food.
You remember her?
Midori, the skinny broad.
She said her husband was in debt.
What' s wrong with you?
That bastard.
Do you know him?
Then she borrowed more money from us...... and ended up screwed both ways.
You know where she is?
If it weren' t for his damn get- rich- quick scheme...
If it weren' t for his damn get- rich- quick scheme...... I' d still be with my wife and kid!
But aren' t they both dead?
I' il kill the bastard!
You' il get killed!
Mitsuo!
Mitsuo!
It was that maid!
Are you okay?!
She' s got a gun!
Hey, what --?!
Kiyoko!
Miyuki!
Hey!
Thank you very much.
She' s got a gun, you know!
- Our lives are already wasted!
- Hana!
There!
Yes!
One of your cabs picked up a young woman with a baby.
Number 1 2- 25.
Send it to...... the Tokyo Tower.
My name is --
Hey!
Wait a minute.
We' re homeless bums, not action- movie heroes.
What we need now is the police.
If you like the police so much, get them to adopt you!
Those children are like family!
I thought I could depend on you!
Don' t talk like you were my damn wife.
I' m not going anywhere.
Gin!
We' ve done all we could.
You' re giving up?
There' s nothing we can do.
You are really the lowest of the low!
The best thing you' il ever do is die in the gutter!
Oh, poor you!
You' il be dead and no one' il care!
All you ever do is cause people trouble!
Dead or alive, you' re living trash!
The king of trash!
Okay, so I' m trash.
But you' re ugly.
- Yes?
- I want to get rid of some trash.
I don' t think I' d fit.
Yeah, that' s what I am, living trash!
Who cares if you die in the gutter?
You' re dead all the same.
You okay?
Hang in there, Gramps.
- May I make one last request?
- What?
Give me a drink of that.
You' re not selling me into slavery!
Somebody, help!
I always wanted to die drunk, in a nice old house.
Now I' m halfway there.
Fate works in strange ways.
I' ve lived a long time...... but I' m just trash, as worthless dead as alive.
Don' t talk like that!
You remind me of myself when I was younger.
Looking at you now...... may I make a last request?
Get rid of this for me.
Some people will be hurt if it' s known who I am.
Okay.
I understand.
No one will ever know.
Take care of yourself, okay?
May I make a last...?
Request?
And now, goodbye.
That' s it!
Thanks, Gramps!
Time for the New Year' s clean- up!
Big breasts....
Cool!
Husband?
Father --
Police.
Your dad' s a cop?!
My father was a policeman!
Father, policeman?
Except I' m the one he' s going to be arresting.
Hold it.
Hi!
How' ve you been?
Now?
Just cleaning up.
Hey, wake up!
Come on!
No!
Not that!
Time to die, old man!
Kiyo' s coming?
I' m there!
The girls are drinking near here.
Yeah?
All cleaned up.
Give it back!
Give me that back!
Her foreigner husband looked like he was in a real bad mood.
Did he hit her?
No, she was being real nice for a girl so young.
My wife could learn something!
His foreign assailant fled, taking a young woman and a baby hostage.
With the groom in serious condition, police speculate this may be a war...... between crime syndicates.
Hey, this is serious!
I' m not kidding around, either!
My mom' s religious.
She chants all the time.
Me.
Isn' t she cute?
I found her.
Those spots on her back look like wings.
So I called her "Angel."
But she' s gone.
Father.
I stabbed my father.
I can never go back.
The baby?
A gift from God.
Yes.
Give me a break!
I' ve got a family at home!
Those children are my family!
They went in there.
Hey!
The fare!
I' il be right back.
Miyuki!
Kiyoko!
Miyuki!
Kiyoko!
Where are you?
Kiyoko!
Miyuki!
How could you do this to me?!
It' s your own fault!
You never listen to anything I say!
Use the scarf I made you...... to mop up the blood!
What have you done with Angel?!
Where is she?
Where is my Angel?
She' s right here.
Our angel.
I' m hungry.
Make me some food.
Why?
What are you doing in my house?
Miyuki, take Kiyoko.
I' il get dinner.
Kiyoko!
Miyuki!
Uncle Bag?!
Oh, I' ve missed you, my little angel!
I wish I was her mother, but I' m just another homo.
Miyuki...... I' m so glad you' re safe.
Where' s the geezer?
He could be dead for all I care!
I' m dying.
Maybe he went home.
Who cares?
All he thinks about is himself.
Yeah, Miss Hana, but you' re in love with him, aren' t you?
Don' t be silly!
I like my men to be more "manly."
The kind of man I like is slender, middle- aged, tanned...... with a divine square- back haircut and a lower- town accent...... who says, "Ah, what the hell"...... when I don' t quite have the cab fare.
So, what now, Miss Hana?
Why are you calling me that?
"Uncle Bag" is fine.
It' s hard to say.
I' m glad.
He just died there?
He was homeless.
I might be next.
Just do your job.
Gin!
Gin!
Gin!
Take it easy.
Gin!
Calm down!
Where is that man of mine?!
Kiyo....
If only tonight...... I wanted to see you before I died.
Kiyoko!
What is your desire?
My magic, or an ambulance?
- An ambulance.
- Well!
Aren' t you rude!
What are we going to do?
Kiyoko can' t sleep out on the street!
The geezer' s not here, we' re freezing, sleepy, hungry.
This sucks!
I guess there' s no choice.
I never thought I' d be here again.
I' m sorry.
We' re closed for a private party tonight --
Hana?!
I know I have no right to come strolling in now...... but there' s no one else I can call on, "Mother"!
Hana!
Mother!
Hana!
Geezer?!
What happened, Gin?!
Some kids beat me up.
I guess I' m just not an action hero.
He said he knew you.
But he said he was homeless, you know.
So am I.
What?
But why?!
Since Ken died I' m like a canary...... that' s forgotten its song.
You sing all the time!
Isn' t she cute?!
I wish I could have one!
So Ken died, did he?
AlDS?
He slipped on the soap.
Well, death is always a hair' s breadth away.
But if you were in trouble, why didn' t you come back?
We certainly had fun here, didn' t we?
In this old bar
I' ve had so much to drink
My old memories
All start to blur
My lover
Has left me
People call me notorious
Aw, you' re ugly!
Good for nothing
Get off!
Good for nothing
What a terrible thing to say
Eat shit, you old fart!
"Shit" I' il take, but "fart" I won' t!
I couldn' t come back after I' d done that.
A little bit of money took care of that.
I' m just happy you' re all right.
Stop it!
You scare me when you start crying.
What about that baby?
Is the girl its mother?
Well....
Where is your mother, anyway?
Abandoned?!
Yes!
I' ve been abandoned!
Them' s the breaks, I guess.
I could see me in her.
Born on the street, and back there again.
That' s why I want to find her a home full of love!
All I ever wanted was love!
Ow!
What the hell?!
The geezer' s come out.
Where are my clothes?!
Way to go, Gin!
Come back any time.
Thank you, Mother.
My mother' s white breath / as she watches me set out / on a long journey.
Oh, man!
An empty building' s always nice, but look who got here first.
I' d just love to fill up on some meat!
Don' t you dare!
Just kidding!
The snow' s let up.
Okay.
Get me some sake.
Just one.
- No!
- I wish.
"Honey, I' m home."
You stayed in there?
You' d think you were homeless!
Actually, we' re looking for these people.
Sachiko Nishizawa.
Do you know her?
She never paid me back for her Neighborhood Association dues.
Are you a relative?
No!
We' re acquaintances of a relative.
Her husband was no better.
Gambling day and night, and mean when he drank.
Living on his wife' s earnings and borrowed money.
Where are they now?
I wouldn' t know.
Mrs. Kurumizawa might.
They left about three months ago.
The house was seized for debt.
One night they just up and went.
They were a nice couple at first...... but it wasn' t long before they started fighting.
That' s poverty for you.
All that debt didn' t stop him from lording it over her.
Even the most dedicated wife has her limits.
You' d see bruises sometimes.
The poor woman.
Not on her, on him!
Oh, dear!
But his mother would always take his side against her.
His parents built them this house.
Where do they live?
Mrs. Yamanouchi might know.
Her mother- in- law was always complaining...... that she never did any housework.
But her son was perfect, of course.
Of course!
That' s why I told her...... she' d never see a grandchild with his wife working in a club.
But she did get pregnant.
Well, a man and a woman....
They can always find time...... to do what they must!
Shinkocho 1 - 2- 25 Maison Happiness Apt.
What if they ran out from this new place too?
What a horrible man!
Poor Sachiko!
Working to pay off her husband' s gambling debts!
Right!
But I never thought of abandoning the kid!
- Huh?
- Nothing.
That' s no reason to just dump the kid!
I' ve said that all along.
Miyuki:
Angel has come home.
Dad.
Doesn' t it ever get tired of snowing?
Thank you.
I wonder how we look to them.
Like a bum, a homo, a runaway and a foundling.
Kiyoko is God' s messenger.
We' re her servants.
Unpaid servants.
Paying for a father' s sins.
Yeah, if her father had been any good at all...... we wouldn' t be going through all this.
Even a good- for- nothing father never forgets a child.
I' m going out.
What' s the matter with her?
A child never forgets its parents.
I never stop wanting...... to see my daughter, just once.
So she' s alive?
Yeah.
And your wife?
I' m sure she' s remarried...... and living happily.
"Hello.
It' s me, Miyuki. "
Why did you split up?
- Drinking and gambling.
- What?!
Just like....
I' m a louse.
But I' ve always wanted to do something for her as a father...... even just a little.
When I was gambling this would have been nothing.
Now I' ve had to sweat blood just to save 30, 000 yen.
That' s great, Gin!
We can stuff ourselves!
Stuff you!
Ishida speaking.
Miyuki?
Is that you?
Are you all right?
I' m sorry!
I' m sorry!
I' m sorry!
Excuse me, but if you wouldn' t mind....
"Get out," you mean?
Other customers might like to sit down.
There' s hardly anyone here!
You guys stink!
What are you?
Homeless or something?
Who are you looking at?
Hold it, you!
It' s New Year' s Sale time at The Food Store!
Come to The Food Store for all your special New Year' s needs!
See in the New Year with your family!
Call an ambulance, quick.
Right!
I knew it!
Kiyoko really is the messenger of God!
Hey!
Miss Hana!
Hey!
Hana!
Following a recent gangland shooting incident...... police are seeking a fugitive thought to be Latin American.
Mitsuo Hiruta, shot three times...... in protecting the leader of his syndicate...... will be questioned after he recovers from his wounds.
Isn' t she cute!
When was she born?
Not long ago, I guess.
So the mother....
I' m not.
What' s her name?
Kiyoko.
That' s my name too.
What a coincidence.
Your friend is very weak.
Make sure he gets rest and proper nutrition.
Doctor!
Believe it or not, we' re homeless.
I' m just a doctor.
Rest and nutrition don' t fit with our lifestyle, you realize.
I can try to cure disease.
Lifestyle is something you have to fix.
All anyone can do is their best.
Take care.
The bill for today is 29, 830 yen.
Bring your health- insurance card and you' il get a refund.
I' m sorry, Gin!
Stop crying!
You' il get the bills all wet.
That' s 30, 000 yen.
Kiyoko?!
Dad?
So you took up nursing.
I see.
I' m glad you' re well.
Oh, yeah, I' m just great.
How' s your mother?
Fine.
Yeah?
That' s good.
What are you doing now?
I' m in recycling.
I had to drop something off here.
You must hate me.
I was never any kind of a father to you.
But that 30, 000 yen was money I' d saved up for you.
You may not believe it.
I always wanted to see you.
When I was little, Mom and I searched for you.
We even checked unidentified corpses.
After you disappeared, Mom ran the store herself.
The store?
It was hard for a woman to run a bicycle shop alone.
That' s not quite the same as a bicycle racer.
The man you owed money to was shot and wounded the other day, you know.
He lived?!
That' s a relief.
I thought you' d say that.
I ran up the debts, not him.
Thank that doctor for me.
He seems like a nice guy.
I' m getting married.
Oh?
That' s good.
To him.
Great!
But isn' t he about my age?
He' s been married.
His daughter got sick and died...... and his wife followed her.
That man makes me so mad!
Aren' t you moved?
Here' s the address and phone number.
Yours?
The old house is gone.
Even if you can' t now, call me sometime.
Kiyoko!
I' ve had about all I can stand!
Miss Hana?
Telling us you were a racer!
I was always at the track.
Yeah, betting!
And your debts snowballed so you couldn' t face your family...... and you ran and hid in a cardboard box!
Yes, damn it!
That' s what your father is!
He can' t bet, he' s spineless, his feet stink and he can' t drink!
He kills off his wife and daughter to buy sympathy!
He said you had an incurable disease!
With a father like that, you have my sympathy!
Is this how you repay me?!
Repay you?!
Am I hearing right?
If we' re talking about debt, I' m waiting for my change!
Debt' s a concept you don' t even understand!
You understand how to troll through garbage cans!
And how to get in debt and how to make babies.
Though you' re not too good at raising them, are you?
And your debts you shove off on your wife.
Always running away, never doing anything right!
Running away' s the only racing you ever did!
Miyuki!
We' re leaving!
Miss Hana?
I guess he' s better.
Should you have said that in front of her?
If she' s his daughter, she' il forgive him.
Being able to speak freely...... is the lifeblood of love.
Maybe I' m na: i: ve.
So you' re in love with him?
Don' t be silly.
I' m the Weeping Red Devil.
What?
It' s a story I love.
There was a red devil who wanted to be friends with people.
But since he was a devil, no one would go near him.
So his friend the blue devil made a plan.
He' d wreak havoc among the people, and the red devil would save them.
When you try to achieve something, someone' s bound to get hurt.
You always have to sacrifice something.
The plan worked.
But the blue devil had to go away so they' d never know it was a trick.
It' s a sad story.
But that means you leave.
Where will you go?
It' s best for everyone when they' re with their family.
Soon we' il find Kiyoko' s mother.
And then what?
You don' t have a real family!
Rare "Line Of Ones" Wins Lottery
Numbers have been drawn for the annual New Year' s Jumbo Lottery.
Top prize in the 200- million- yen lottery is a very rare number.
Group 1 1, number 1 1 1, 1 1 1...... is worth 50 million yen.
A different group pays 1 00, 000 yen.
To repeat, the winning prize number is....
This just in.
Police have released a sketch of an infant taken...... from a hospital in Tokyo' s Shinagawa Ward.
We' ve come all the way here, but we don' t have her address!
The geezer' s got it!
Let' s go back.
Where are you going?
- The police!
- What?
You hated that idea!
I was just ego- tripping.
Now I want to apologize to her parents.
They might not be able to sleep waiting for news about her.
That' s what we said from the very start!
They might even be about to commit suicide!
I' ve done something that can' t be taken back!
I' il throw myself in this river.
I' il step neatly out of my shoes, stand on the handrail, and be at peace.
But then I' il see a baby' s face on the water.
No!
While I see this child' s face, I cannot die!
Hey, you!
No!
You' re too young for this!
Please!
Let me die!
You!
Sachiko Nishizawa.
What were you thinking of?!
Is that an apology?
If we hadn' t found this child, she would' ve frozen to death!
It wasn' t me!
My husband took her away when I wasn' t there!
I' ve looked and looked!
Is that true?
All I' ve suffered on account of that man!
"Hi, Mom!"
God really loves this child, you know.
I want you to give her lots of love too.
Do right by her, or you' il pay for it.
I' m so sorry!
I' m sorry!
Mrs. Nishizawa!
What are you doing in here?!
Get out of here!
Get out!
Wait!
I' m no thief.
You' re lying!
Get out!
Where' s the baby?!
Did an old queer and a girl come to give it back?
What are you talking about?!
You abandoned a baby!
I can prove it.
Are you a cop?
Huh?
I' m just a bum who was passing by.
Are you right in the head?
I' m damn near crazy from all this!
Why is the baby you abandoned on the news as being "taken away"?
They' il call us kidnappers!
It wasn' t me.
That' s not my kid.
What?
There, there!
Don' t cry!
Take care.
Raise her right.
See you again someday.
Never leave her again.
On the year' s last day / when all of a life' s accounts / have been settled up.
Sachiko stole that baby out of the hospital.
She stole a baby and then abandoned it?!
That' s a person' s life!
She lied to me about it!
And now it' s gone way out of control.
I don' t want anything to do with it!
Take the kid to the police!
What?!
Don' t act like you' re not part of this!
You don' t want to get involved?
You' re her husband!
That' s all over!
I' m getting my life back together.
Look!
I won 1 00, 000 yen in the lottery.
My luck' s turned!
I know a guy just like you.
He threw away his life and his family.
No.
They threw him away.
I' m no loser!
These were in your wife' s bag.
Any idea where she might have gone?
She said she was going to be with her baby.
She was going to kill herself!
There' s no time to waste!
No!
She was just going to go look for the kid.
She' s desperate.
That only means one thing!
But where do I look?!
Hana!
Miyuki!
Kiyoko!
God must be busy at this time of year.
Better once a year than never.
Geezer?
You' re too late.
You just missed a very moving finale.
What' s the matter?
"Kiyoko"!
"Stomach"?
"Mother"!
Now that' s settled...... what the hell do you mean?!
Fake!
The mother!
Sachiko' s a fake!
Pardon?
Why won' t you drink?
A baby has to drink from its mother' s breast.
We' il never be close if you don' t!
Sorry.
Wrong people.
She can' t be far!
But where do we look?
We can' t just give her up now!
That' s Kiyoko!
Should you be running?
If I don' t run now, when will I?
This way!
Returning stolen goods to a thief!
How could we be so dumb?!
Who said "family suicide"?
You did!
- Which way?
- Left.
- Okay, right!
- Why?
You' re a lousy gambler!
You got that right.
Somebody help!
Hey!
Wait!
Thief!
Thief!
What' s wrong?
A woman just stole my truck!
Hey!
Thief!
Yes!
That woman!
She' s a baby thief!
Be quiet, will you?
Be a good baby!
Stop!
Give Kiyoko back!
Give me a break!
I' m forever in your debt!
Gin!
That woman' s crazy!
Get closer!
I can' t!
You have to, for Kiyoko!
- Who' s Kiyoko?!
- Step on it like a man!
Okay!
Please!
Be quiet!
- Gin!
- Geezer?!
Geezer!
Go for it, Gin!
No action star can touch you!
Pass her!
We' il die!
Step on it!
Okay!
Stop crying!
Don' t be afraid.
I' il never leave you again.
You want to die?!
Gin!
Gin!
There!
- Are you okay?!
- Where' s Kiyoko?
- Faster!
- Okay!
Which way?
We' re at the scene...... where a truck has crashed into a building in Shinagawa.
Now a woman holding a baby has appeared on the roof.
Witnesses say the woman is connected with the incident...... as she was driving the truck.
Now there' s someone else on the roof!
Stay away!
No!
Tell me why you took that baby.
I didn' t!
This baby is mine!
You' re lying!
Its real parents are worried sick about it!
That' s not true!
You of all people should know what it' s like to lose a child!
She' s dead.
My baby died before she was even born!
All the other babies looked so healthy there in the ward.
I wanted to die.
But then this baby smiled at me.
I decided she was mine.
I thought as long as I had her, everything would be fine.
My husband would mend his ways, and we' d be a real family.
That' s bullshit!
If you' re going to die, do it alone!
A life is a life.
It' s only born once.
You, me, or Kiyoko.
Give her back, okay?
I want to be reborn.
Sachiko!
Sachiko, don' t die!
Come back to me!
I was wrong!
Please, don' t kill yourself!
We' il start again!
We' il be reborn!
Sachiko!
I' il go first and wait for you.
Sachiko!
Please!
Let me die!
Kiyoko wants to see her mom and dad!
I want to go home.
I' m sorry!
Take her...... to her mother and father.
Oh, no.
Hana!
I' m okay!
I' m still alive!
Inspector, I don' t know how to thank you.
We' re not the ones you should thank.
Man, that was a good sleep!
Get me a cigarette, Miyuki.
- In my jacket.
- Yeah, yeah.
That was some New Year' s!
It' s "No Smoking" here.
Lighten up!
I' m a hero!
You mean "we"!
I guess we won' t have to listen to Kiyoko' s damn crying anymore.
She' s not "Kiyoko" anymore.
I' m not pleased.
What can we do?
Not that.
This is a men' s ward!
Perhaps we' re intruding.
No, it' s just...... I' m told they' re homeless.
Who cares?
We' d like them to be her godfathers.
Come in.
Excuse us.
The baby' s parents would like to thank you --
Dad....
Some things start out big, and some things start out small, very small.
But sometimes the smallest thing... can make the biggest changes of all.
Dad, get over here.
- Zini, it' s not safe.
- Oh, I always have to go when stuff' s happening.
Well, what is it?
It was an egg.
Look.
- It' s a cold- blooded monster from across the sea.
- Vicious, flesh- eating.
- Looks like a baby to me.
Babies grow up.
You keep that thing, one day, we' il turn our backs -- it' il be picking us out of its teeth.
- Things like that eat things like us as snacks!
So, what do we do?
Get rid of it!
What has gotten into you?
Plio, that thing is dangerous!
I' m sorry, little one.
Okay, get rid of it.
I will.
It looks hungry.
Here.
It' s okay.
- We' il teach him to hate meat.
Watch his head.
I- I mean, watch it, he could bite.
This monster' s got no teeth.
Gum us to death?
Zini, come on.
Look at that sweet little face.
Does that look like a monster to you?
Let me out!
Hair ball.
That was great!
Get him!
Attacking lemurs!
Suri, please!
Come on!
Pick on someone your own size!
Help!
Aladar, you' re not dead.
No!
All right, guys, break it up.
Remember the courtship?
- You gonna miss seeing all that smooching.
- That' s okay, Plio.
- It' s a shame you don' t like kids.
- Nasty little vermin.
Go find Zini.
He' s rehearsing pickup lines.
Let' s hope he' s found some new material.
Hey, sweetie, if you' il be my bride, I' il groom ya.
Oh, that' s good.
Girls, I' m known as the "professor of love", and school' s in session.
- Yeah, I still got it.
- I hope it' s not contagious.
- I' m a raging epidemic of romance.
Let' s get goin '.
[Zini]
I can' t wait to hear the mating advice of an old monkey.
Hey- hey- hey, I heard that in his day, that old monkey was quite a swinger.
You talkin 'about Yar?
- Yeah, to hear him tell it, he put the "prime" in "primate".
Really?
Whoo!
- Make 'em look good, son.
- Come on, Yar.
- [Lemur]
Hey, ladies!
- Hey, beautiful!
Hey, free samples!
Zini.
Come on.
I am the action!
You always have next year.
Hey, I' m lucky to be rid of them.
- before you know it, they all wanna move to a bigger tree.
Oh, well.
Poor Zini.
No, we have two.
Well, it' s never really been his best event.
- Oh, Aladar, if only there was someone on the island for you.
Well, you know, who looks like you, but prettier.
Come on, Plio.
What more could I want?
Dad?
Something' s wrong.
Aladar, where' s Suri?
She' s up in the... tree.
Come on!
Go!
Mom!
- Suri!
Mom!
- Suri!
Suri, where are you?
Run!
Yar, come on!
Jump!
Zini, jump!
Hold on!
Plio!
Yar!
Where are you?
Aladar, over here!
Oh, Suri.
They' re all gone.
I' m here.
Come on.
We can' t stay here.
Now, now, Suri.
There' s nothing to be afraid of.
What?
- [Suri]
- [Plio]
Where did it go?
Let' s go see.
Hey!
- [Plio]
It' s scaring Suri.
No, it' s not.
Everyone just be quiet.
- [Plio]
Yar, grab on!
Aladar, they' re stopping!
Stay out of my way!
Move it!
Watch it.
Zini, get your head down.
Walkin 'backwards, huh?
Well, let me know if that gets you there any faster.
Keep those little legs movin 'Url, or you' il get left behind.
Look at all the Aladars.
- If you' re even thinking of joining them --
Hang on!
Oh, Eema, I wish we were at your nesting grounds now.
All this pushing and shoving about, just for a place to sleep.
I' m not used to this kind of behavior.
- Baylene, you got big feet.
Just give 'em a kick.
Ooh, I couldn' t possibly.
Shoo, shoo.
You wanna get to the nesting grounds alive?
Uh, it' s just, we overheard you talking, and, um --
Look at Url.
- He doesn' t normally warm up to strangers so fast.
- What an unfortunate blemish.
- Good mud bath' d clear those right up.
Excuse me?
Um, he' s my grandfather, couple of times removed.
Try a couple of species removed.
Uh, my name' s Aladar.
This is my family.
We' re... all that' s left.
I' m so sorry.
Baylene' s the last of her kind.
Finding stragglers like her all along the way.
I heard you say something about... nesting grounds?
It is the most beautiful place there is, child.
It' s where the herd goes to have their babies.
Will we find anybody that looks... like us there?
Oh, the last few days, I' ve seen 'em all shapes and sizes.
Who knows what we' il find.
The hard job now is just getting there.
- And we' re being driven unmercifully.
- By who?
Kron, the herd' s head honcho.
An older woman like myself --
It' s -- Well, it' s positively indecent.
What' s the worst he can do?
Oh!
What' s his problem?
- That' s him, honey.
Kron, got a second?
- Get lost, kid.
Relax, Bruton.
- Who are you?
- Uh, Aladar.
Why aren' t you uphill with the -- uh, young bloods?
- Well, I was back here talking to these guys.
- I guess they -- They' re having a hard time keeping up.
- So, you know, maybe you could slow it down a bit?
Let the weak set the pace.
Now, there' s an idea.
Better let me do the thinking from now on, Aladar.
- Hey, they need help back here.
Watch yourself, boy.
Don' t worry.
That' s how my brother treats newcomers, no matter how charming they are.
You sure know how to catch a girl' s eye, there, stud.
I wouldn' t be catchin 'nobody' s eye if I was you, especially Neera' s.
You just keep your head down, and you mind what Kron tells you.
Since when do we take orders from the likes of him?
Kron has swatted flies bigger than you, pops.
I could hold that monster' s brain in the palm of my --
- than get 'em bitten off by... those things.
Well, you just consider yourself lucky that' s all that' s following us.
Hey, wake up.
- Enough with the beauty sleep.
You' re ravishing already.
Hello!
Anybody in there?
Zini, what are you doing?
- Come on!
Move it!
[Zini]
The herd' s gathering without us.
Rise and shine!
Kron says everybody goes.
Come on.
Huh.
The charm never stops around here.
Uh, no -- no, sir.
Unless you got a death wish, you and that little parasite better get moving!
Hey, hey, hey, there' s your girlfriend.
- What are you talkin 'about?
- You know what I' m talkin 'about:
Big ankles.
Yeah, I made a real impression on her.
What you need is a little help from the love monkey.
That, children, is what' s known as a "jerkasaurus".
[Baylene]
- It looks like a very long walk.
- [Eema]
If you smell somethin 'sizzlin', it could be me.
We' re moving too slow.
I' il pick up the pace.
Hey, old girl, you' re wandering off a bit.
That' s all I need: a monkey on my back.
On your feet, Eema.
We can' t let those things eat you.
They' re out there waiting.
- [Yar]
We made it?
It' s just over that -- that hill, baby.
Oh, thank goodness.
Remember water?
Oh, it' s time to refresh my memory.
I' m just gonna walk right into that lake... - until the water' s up to my eyeballs... and soak it all in.
Maybe the rains collected somewhere else.
What do you want us to do?
Take a scout and check the entire perimeter.
Enough!
You have to be strong now.
The nesting grounds are only a few days away.
Keep moving!
- Kron, we' ve never gone this long without water.
Then we save the half that deserves to live.
They' re moving already?
Oh- ho, we' il never keep up.
There was water here, always water here before.
We always had water, always.
- And -- And plenty of mud.
- Oh, Eema, please.
The herd won' t wait.
We must carry on.
You gotta get up.
- There was water everywhere.
- There is no water, dear.
- Baylene, don' t move.
- Oh, what is it?
- Do you hear that?
- I sure do.
Lift your foot, Baylene.
Now press down.
I always did like big girls!
- Water!
- Oh, my goodness!
- Water!
Come on!
- He found water.
That' s it, Eema.
Come drink.
Kron, look.
Good.
Now, get out of the way.
Wait!
There' s enough for everyone!
- Eema!
That' s it.
That' s very helpful.
I think they' re scared of me.
Who wouldn' t be?
You are pretty scary.
Come on over, guys.
She' s just a hair ball.
- And proud of it.
He' s gonna find you some water.
Now, you just take a foot and press.
Come on.
Let' s - let' s work together here, huh?
One, two, three.
Good job, Suri.
- So, where are your parents, anyway?
- A lot of us are on our own now.
You like kids, I see.
- Well, the skinny ones can be a little chewy.
I' m Aladar, the... "jerkasaurus".
Ohh.
Sorry, about that.
- Dad, wake up.
Why did you help that old one?
What else could we do?
You mean, you actually --
Well, that happens all the time.
- You don' t survive if you' re not -- - Strong enough.
Well... yeah.
Is that you talking, or your brother?
Everything' s so different.
I - I don' t know what to think anymore.
Look, Neera -- we watch out for each other, we all stand a chance of getting to your nesting grounds.
- You sound so sure.
- I' m not, but it' s all I know.
So, um -- Oh, water.
I' il, uh, get you some water.
- Sure.
Just... press.
- No.
You -- You first.
One down... and, well, one down.
Kron!
- What?
They never come this far north.
The fireball must' ve driven them out.
You led them right to us!
Maybe you can feed them with your hide!
Move the herd out, double- time!
- What' s happening?
- My brother' s moving the herd.
Kron, what' s going on?
Carnotaurs.
If we don' t keep moving, they' il catch up to us.
But... the others in the back -- They' il never make it.
They' il slow down the predators.
You can' t sacrifice them like this!
That could be you back there!
If you ever interfere again,
Stay away from him!
Aladar, no.
You just -- just go.
Let' s go!
Let' s go!
Carnotaurs!
Carnotaur.
A mouthful of teeth with a bad attitude.
Get on!
We' re losing them!
Aladar, slow down.
Oh, it' s Bruton.
It appears we weren' t the only ones left behind.
- What happened?
- Carnotaurs.
Oh, we should keep moving.
- We can' t just leave him here.
- We can if we move fast enough.
Hey, you don' t look so good.
Save your pity.
I just need some rest.
Now, get away from me.
Suit yourself.
Change your mind, we' il be in those caves.
It' s dark, but at least it' s dry.
It' s the dark part I' m having trouble with.
Ouch!
Sorry, Url.
Sturdy little thing, ain' t he?
We appear to have a visitor.
You coming in, or what?
What is it with you?
At least I know enough to get in out of the rain.
Now, come on.
- Uh, you can lie down with us.
It' s warmer.
May I remind you that he' s one of them?
Well, looks like he' s one of us now.
Who booked this trip, anyway?
Ah, you' il be at the nesting grounds soon enough.
Well, when I get there, I' m gonna give Kron a piece of my mind.
You tell him, Eema.
If I could sleep that deep, I' d be in paradise.
If you could sleep that deep, honey, you' d be dead.
This plant grew on our island.
It will make you feel better.
Why is he doing this?
Pushing them on with false hope?
It' s hope that' s gotten us this far.
But why doesn' t he let them accept their fate?
- And what is your fate?
It' s the way things are.
Only if you give up, Bruton.
It' s your choice, not your fate.
Well, the plant will help.
- Wake the others.
Go!
Hurry!
Move it, Eema!
[Plio]
Aladar!
You help the others!
Bruton!
No!
Bruton!
You did what you could.
We' re going to make it.
Let' s do it again.
- Uh, I spy with my little eye -- - A rock.
You got it again!
Ooh!
You are good!
Well, I' il tell you what I spy.
- What do we do now?
- I guess we just go back.
Hold on a moment.
Zini, what is it?
- Do you smell that?
Get a load of that.
Everybody stand back.
We' re outta here!
Aladar, look out!
No!
You were right.
And I' m going to go on believing it.
And I, for one, am not willing to die here.
Oh, dear.
The nesting grounds.
It' s -- It' s untouched.
Our new home.
And it comes with a pool!
Cannonball!
Amateur.
Look out below!
- Not bad.
But I don' t get it.
Not to mention Neera.
Soon enough.
Oh, no.
- I spoke too soon.
- What is it?
That is the way we used to get in here.
They' il never make it over that.
Aladar, wait!
Kron' il eat you alive.
Let him try.
I hope Kron' s in a listening mood.
Stay here.
We' il find a way around it.
In the morning, we' il climb it.
We have to keep trying.
Our survival, our future, is over these rocks.
Now, let' s go home!
You' il make it, won' t you, boys?
- No.
- Watch them.
They' re tough!
[Aladar]
Get the herd out of here!
A carnotaur is coming!
- Keep moving!
- [Aladar]
- I' ve been to the valley!
Show 'em!
- Kron, listen to him.
- Look, we gotta go now!
- Go where, straight to the carnotaurs?
If we hurry, we can get around them!
You can' t get over those rocks!
There' s a sheer drop on the other side!
You' re gonna kill the herd!
I know a way to the valley, and everybody can make it!
Kron!
They' re staying with me!
Neera!
He' s led that monster right to us!
Don' t move!
If we scatter, he' il pick us off!.
Stand together!
[Neera]
[Eema]
Bringing in babies is what I do best.
I' d say it' s been a few years since you' ve hatched an egg.
- You' re right, so let me practice on your head.
Look!
Somebody wants to meet you.
Aren' t you the sweetest little small fry I ever did see?
He looks just like me.
Meet your dad.
He' s not as crazy as he looks.
Oh, happy day.
Well done, little one.
Come here, you little rascal.
You' re your father' s son, all right.
Look what I found!
New neighbors!
Any of you ladies up for a game of "monkey in the middle"?
Easy!
None of us really know what changes, big or small, lie ahead.
One thing is certain -- Our journey' s not over.
We can only hope that, in some small way... our time here will be remembered.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
I' m gonna be a dad!
My baby' s gonna be delivered any minute.
- Hey, get out of the way.
- Hey, I' m gonna be a dad.
Congratulate me.
Good for you, Herb.
Don' t even think about it.
Hey!
How are you?
Nice to see you.
I' m gonna be a dad!
Congrats!
Hey, Mr. Nuts, did you hear the news?
- Yeah.
- Beautiful day, isn' t it?
I' m here.
I' m here.
- I' m here.
- Oh, honey, I' m so sorry.
You missed the delivery.
It' s okay.
Making the baby' s the fun part.
Honey, I think you' ve got the wrong...
No, I don' t need to see the directions.
Push, push.
Push!
Twelve hours of labor.
Oh, but it was won' th it.
Look at him.
Look at him.
Rodney Copperbottom.
He' s got your mom' s eyes and my dad' s nose.
I knew we were smart to save those parts.
This Copperbottom will do great things for the world, I can feel it.
- Honey?
- What?
What' s that extra piece?
Oh, no, they always put in an extra...
We did want a boy, right?
This won' t hurt a bit, son.
Got your nose.
Got your nose.
Got your...
- Hi, son.
- Are those my big- boy parts?
They sure are.
They' re not shiny.
Well, they' re not brand- new.
They' re preowned.
So...
They' re hand- me- downs from your cousin Jeffrey.
And they' re only for a year.
Hey, Dad, who' s that?
That, Rodney, is Bigweld.
The greatest robot in the world.
I thought you were the greatest robot in the world.
No, besides me.
He' s the head of Bigweld Industries.
He invents things that make everyone' s life better.
- Could I meet him?
- Sure, maybe someday.
- Dad?
- Yeah?
- What do you do?
I work in a big, fancy restaurant.
I' m a dishwasher.
And now, live from Robot City, it' s The Bigweld Show.
Oh, yeah!
Come on, Dad, you' re missing it.
All right, Rodney.
I' m coming.
I had to bring work home with me again, I' m sorry.
Mr. Gunk has really been piling it on.
And now, the host of our show, Bigweld.
Welcome.
This week I thought you' d like to take a look around Bigweld Industries.
This here is the front gate.
Kind of cute, ain 't it?
- Good morning, Tim.
- Good morning, Mr. Bigweld, sir.
Tim, who closed the front gate?
Well, I just thought since...
We never shut the gate, Tim.
Shutting this gate means shutting out fresh ideas.
See, every day, robots come here from hither and yon...... bringing us new ideas.
And I listen to every single one of them.
So remember, whether a bot is made of new parts, old parts or spare parts...... you can shine no matter what you' re made of.
He' s talking to me, Dad.
He sure is, son.
He sure is.
Okay, folks, let' s get to inventing.
You know, I love to tinker...... but all the tinkering in the world isn 't useful unless it starts with a good idea.
So look around for a need and start coming up with ideas to fill that need.
One idea will lead to another, and before you know it...... you' ve done it.
That' s it, Dad.
I have to look for...... a need.
Easy, now.
- Hey there, sport.
- Oh, hi.
These are your 12- year- old parts.
They' re...
Hand- me- downs.
I know, Dad.
- I don' t mind.
- They are from your cousin...... Veronica.
You know how popular she is.
Thanks.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Soon as you reach the age where your warranty expires, you start falling apart.
Pretty soon there' s gonna be more duct tape than me.
- Can I try it now, Dad?
- Oh, Rodney...
- Have you worked all the kinks out of it?
- This is gonna make your job easy.
I invented it for you.
Okay.
Let' s try it.
Great.
Okay, this is it.
Wonderbot, go to work.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey!
Copperbottom!
- Mr. Gunk.
- What is that?
- Oh, that.
My son made it.
- What' s it doing?
Mr. Gunk, please, you' re making it nervous.
It' s wrecking my kitchen!
- I' il stop it.
- No!
Your son, huh?
It wasrt his fault.
He had nothing to do with it.
Yes, sir, he' s a brilliant boy.
An inventor.
You, clean up this mess.
Inventor.
You' re the hand- me- down son of a dishwasher, and that' s all you' il ever be.
Somebody scrape this crud off of me.
And serve it to the customers.
Roundtrip or one- way?
One- way.
There you are.
I told you I' d find him.
- It' s a mother' s instinct.
He left us a note:
"I' m leaving.
I' il be at the train station. "
Never mind.
You' re coming home.
No, Mom.
I have to do this.
I' m going to Robot City tonight.
I' m gonna get a job and I' m gonna help Dad pay back Mr. Gunk.
Talk to him.
- Ro...
- Robot City?
You' re just a kid.
I' m never gonna be someone here.
I wanna meet Bigweld.
I wanna be somebody.
You are somebody.
Somebody who' s not getting on that train.
- Yes, I am.
- Talk to him.
- One ticket for Robot City.
- Where are you going?
- Not me.
Him.
- But...
Rodney, did you know that when I was your age, I wanted to be a musician?
I played pretty well too...... but my dad was worried I wouldn' t be able to make a living.
So I got refitted to be a dishwasher.
Now, I' m not complaining.
But I' ve always said to myself...... if I could do it over again, I would follow my dream.
You' ve got greatness in you, Rodney.
Never doubt it.
You go to Robot City.
You go meet Bigweld, and you show him your big ideas.
And, Rodney...... never, never give up.
All aboard.
Mom.
I won' t let you down, Dad.
I' il make you proud.
I know you will.
Excuse me, I wonder if...
- Gave at the office.
- I wonder if you...
Could you direct me to Bigweld Indust...?
- What?
- Perfect.
That will be 50 bucks.
Fifty bucks?
For what?
A beautiful picture of your first moment in Robot City.
There.
Your second moment.
That' s another $50.
Are you keeping track?
Come on, work with me, work with me.
More pout, less pose.
Great.
Inside of you is a fashion model waiting to throw up.
Give me those eyes.
Give me big anime eyes.
- Yeah!
Loving it, loving it, loving it!
- I don' t want any pictures.
- You don' t?
- No.
That' s all right.
Would you like a map to the stars' homes?
Where did he go?
- Buddy, wanna buy a watch?
- Don' t buy us, we' re fakes.
Next.
Excuse me, how do I get to Bigweld Industries?
Oh, great...
Never mind.
Hi, excuse me.
How do I get to Bigweld Industries?
What?
Yeah, thanks.
Cross- town express to Foundry District...... with stops at Bigweld Industries and Battery Park only.
Please tighten all spools, nuts, bolts and detachable appendages.
Riders with high oil pressure are advised to take the local.
Thank you, and have a nice day.
No, no.
- Say, are you following me?
- No.
- First time on the cross- town express?
- Well, actually, I...
Oh, boy.
Good luck in the big city.
If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.
And if you can' t make it here, welcome to the club.
- Oh, no.
What is it?
We' re going off the track.
We' re gonna crash!
- What?
- I don' t wanna die.
I was just kidding.
Just put your head between your legs.
Yeah!
There goes my stop.
It' s embarrassing.
Sorry.
You know, it used to be a lot worse.
They had this giant hammer...
Oh, they brought it back.
I know this town like the back of my hand.
Hey, that' s new.
Excuse me.
Can I help you?
Sorry, I...
- Hey, you' re Tim from the TV show.
- That' s me.
Well, hey, Tim.
Who closed the gate?
It' s never supposed to be...
Yeah, okay, what do you want?
I' d like to see Mr. Bigweld.
I' m an inventor.
Oh, why didn' t you say so?
Stand back.
Thanks.
What?
I got you.
You see, because you were all excited and then, boom!
All right, I had my laugh.
Go on in.
Now, that' s funny.
The second time.
You really think I' m gonna let you in.
But I' m not.
Sorry, kid, nobody gets in.
Company rules.
Company ru...?
Well, then how do they hire new inventors?
They don' t.
Those days are over.
My advice:
Then the job is yours.
So remember, whether a bot is made of new parts, old parts or spare parts...... you can shine no matter what you' re made of.
My goodness, what a remarkable legacy.
Concern for the common robot.
You don' t come across old- fashioned values like that anymore, friends.
And for good reason.
There' s no money in it!
Hello?
Memo to Bigweld:
We' re not a charity.
That' s why old fat face no longer sits in the big chair.
He' s a relic.
So I don' t wanna hear another, "Where' s Bigweld?"
We' il see him next month at the Bigweld Ball.
He always goes to that.
Now, let' s get down to the business of sucking every loose penny...... out of Mr. And Mrs. Average- Knucklehead.
What' s our big- ticket item?
Upgrades.
That' s how we make the dough.
Now, if we' re telling robots that no matter what they' re made of, they' re "fine"...... how can we expect them to feel crummy enough about themselves...... to buy our upgrades and make themselves look better?
Therefore, I' ve come up with a new slogan.
"Why be you when you can be new?"
I gotta tell you, I think it' s brilliant...... but, honestly, I' d like to hear what you employees think about this.
- Hear, hear.
- Out of the ballpark, Ratchet.
Just don' t look down.
Hey.
Get off.
Go on, get off.
Get off of...
Cappy, you haven' t said a word.
- It gave me chills.
- Thank you, thank you.
- But...
- But?
I' m just wondering, why would robots buy new upgrades...... if parts are so much cheaper?
Oh, right.
Well, that' s easy.
Because as of today, we are no longer making spare parts.
Do you know what I call robots who can' t afford upgrades?
Scrap metal.
You see them on the streets, misshapen and rust- covered.
They turn your insides out.
You wanna run home and scrub yourself.
Now, Cappy, I want your department to push our new slogan.
In fact, I' m moving you into the office right next to mine.
We' il be working very, very closely together on this one.
- Wort that be fun?
- Oodles.
- Oh, so sorry, I...
- What the...?
Who doesn' t seem to be here.
Gee, no, no.
But while he' s away, he left me in charge.
Oh, well, then let me show you what this can do.
I have a better idea.
Why don' t you let me show you what it can do.
It can do this!
So how did it go?
What the heck is going on around here?
Some highly polished jerk is sitting in Bigweld' s chair.
And you' re sitting on the sidewalk, magnetized.
Listen, I' il be back, and I' m gonna get to the bottom of this.
When you pick a lost cause, you really commit.
Where do they make dreamers like you?
Get lost, freak!
All right, break time.
All right, break time' s over.
Chop- chop.
Look who' s here.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.
How' s my boy?
Great.
I did just what you told me.
No more spare parts.
In a couple of weeks, those broken- down losers out there will be scrap metal.
You will be up to your bloomers in broken- elbow junk.
Such a good boy.
And after you finish off Bigweld...... there will be nobody out there to fix them.
Exactly!
You wanna swing that one by me again?
Idiot!
Those outmodes look up to him.
- Oh, come on, Mom.
- He' s not gonna be trouble where he is.
- What are you afraid of?
Grow some bolts.
Or do you want to end up like your father?
Good to see you.
Think what it would mean.
Not Bigweld Industries, Ratchet Industries.
Keep talking.
Ratchet City!
Yes, everything shiny.
No more Bigweld, no more outmode.
Let' s do it!
That' s my boy!
Are you hungry?
Can I get you something?
- You look thin.
- No, no, no, Mom.
I gotta go.
Bye, Pop.
So long, son.
Good luck with your dastardly plans.
Hey.
Hi there.
Listen, if I seem to be getting smaller, it' s because I' m leaving.
Foot, don' t fail me now.
Stop!
Hey, you got my foot!
Oh, great.
Happy now?
Not until you give me back my foot, you mugger.
I am not a mugger.
I happen to be...... a scrounger.
I didn' t know you were at the end of that foot.
Here, let me help you with that.
No, no, no, I' il do it myself.
I have my pride, you know.
Over here.
Oh, no.
No, not that close.
Hold on, hold on.
No.
No, no.
What' s the use?
There' s nothing left.
Hey, Diesel, I found you a voice box.
Here' s another one.
That' s no good.
Give me that.
I can never find parts in my size.
What is it, boy?
Hey, Fender, have you lost weight?
Lost weight?
Look at where you' re looking.
He' s a head in a basket.
We' re doomed.
Yeah, will you shut up, you neurotic nut?
Why, I' d smack you if I had a hand.
Wow, speak of the devil, here I come.
Dang!
Check this out.
Who would throw away such a cute little doodad?
- Don' t be scared.
- Hey, that' s mine.
That' s him.
That' s the guy.
I would know that face.
I know that face, and I know that foot.
He' s over there, moron.
That' s the perpetrator.
He knocked my head off.
- You want another piece of me?
- All right, buster.
If you think you can mess with my big brother, you' re...
You' re kind of cute.
Piper, would you behave yourself.
Now, come on, let' s get Fender fixed.
Again.
Here' s your thingamabob.
By the way, the name' s Piper.
Rhymes with "viper."
See you around.
We' ve told you a hundred times:
"Don' t talk to strange men."
Thank you, Manuel.
I talk to you.
Who' s stranger than that?
I got good news, and I got bad news.
- What' s the bad news?
- I checked the stock book.
And as of today, they are no longer making parts for your model.
You have been officially outmoded.
Outmoded?
Well, that' s fine.
What' s the good news?!
Well, when we had your parts, they were on sale.
How could this happen to me?
I' m practically a kid.
Look, pull yourself together.
All you need is an upgrade.
That new- upgrade smell.
Just came in, fully loaded.
Look.
It' s got cup- holders, standard.
Does it come in plus sizes?
Sure, take a look at the new Bigweld spring collection.
I can' t afford that fancy stuff.
All I need is one stinking neck joint.
Why did this happen to me?
I' m hurting me.
Idiot.
Sorry, pal, it' s either upgrade or the chop shop for you.
The chop shop?
I' m fine, I' m fine.
Look, no hands.
Ta- da!
Miss me?
- No one' s going to the chop shop.
- That' s right.
What do you think we can get for him?
Will you stop?
Listen, shiny pants...... you get back there and find a part for my brother.
We are not junk, we are not scrap, and we will not be treated this way.
I don' t have the parts.
Well, do you have two washers, an S- spring and some Fastweld?
I can fix you easy.
The Force is strong with this one.
When was the last time you got oiled?
I can' t answer that with my kid sister here.
Can it, Fender.
Hold still.
This might tickle.
We haven' t been properly introduced.
I' m Fender.
Used to be Bumper...... but had to change it when we came in to the country.
Copperbottom, Rodney Copperbottom.
Riddle me this:
Why did I meet you among the garbage?
Well, today I tried to get in to see Bigweld.
Well, if you find him, tell him we really need him to come back.
He cared about bots like us.
I heard they' ve done him in and left the rest of us to fall apart.
Well, that ought to do it.
Look at that!
And he fixed my neck.
- Sweeper!
- Sweeper?
Make yourself scarce.
What' s the big deal?
- Well, if you' re an outmode like Fender...
- Hey.
They sweep you up and take you to the chop shop.
Where they melt you down and turn you into something else.
You mean...?
Yep.
Sweepers.
Sweepers.
Here' s one outmode you' re not gonna get.
Fender, run!
That was close.
When in Robot City, guests of the Rusties...
- Stay at Aunt Fanny' s boarding house, where our motto is:
"Beats rusting outside."
Let me just let her know you' re here.
- We brought someone.
- I' m in the kitchen.
- Are you sure your aunt won' t mind?
- Relax, she' s not my aunt.
She just takes in bots who are broke.
Bless her little heart.
Well, then why is she called Aunt Fanny?
We couldn' t call her Aunt Booty.
Oh, crap.
She' s a little artsy- fartsy.
The artsy' s okay, but when she gets fartsy...
Look at...
Oh, right on my shoes.
I' m so clumsy.
What' s your name?
I' m Rodney Bigbottom...
No, I' m Rodney Copperbottom.
Copperbottom.
That' s a wonderful name, Bigbottom.
Well, I just...
- What happened to your friend?
- He' s been rear- ended.
Oh, there you are.
Aunt Fanny, he needs a place to stay.
Well, just make yourself at home.
That' s very kind of you.
My pleasure.
See a need, fill a need.
Hey, just like Bigweld.
Bigweld.
That' s a lot of robot.
You can bunk with me.
We' il ignore the gossip.
You missed a spot.
Fender, get out of my room!
I' m not in your room.
I am now.
Now I' m not.
I am.
Not.
Am...
Get out of my room.
Oh, man, this is my third oil change today.
Something' s wrong with me.
Sorry.
Here we are.
Home sweet home.
What' s mine is yours.
- Oh, dear.
- I' il get them.
Look at that.
Now they' re arm- wrestling.
Could you separate them?
Hurry, my backside itches.
I know that sounds bad, but I' m just doing musical arm farts.
You know how to do those?
They' re hard to do, because we' re metal, but that' s where the skill comes in.
I' m real close.
Listen.
No, wait.
No, wait, wait.
Like an old man.
You know, I' m a little tired.
Maybe tomorrow.
Kind of a rough day, huh?
Kind of.
My dad' s probably sitting by the phone...... waiting for his brilliant son to call...... and tell him what a big success my first day was.
I know it' s not your problem.
If you burden your friends, you won' t have any.
What are you, a fortune cookie?
"That' s what friends..."
You consider me a friend?
Sure, what else would I consider you?
An embarrassment, a way to rebel against your parents...... a desperate cry for help.
The list is endless.
Let' s just stick with friend.
You know, even though you had a discouraging day, remember...... there' s another one coming tomorrow.
You know, my last roommate jumped out that window.
Hey, Fender.
Yeah, baby.
Let it rip!
Guys, come on, what are you, 3 years old?
This is how a man does it.
You guys are so gross.
Besides, this is how you do it.
Hey, kids, get a load of this.
Aunt Fanny...... we were using our arms.
Oh, excuse me.
Lady, please...... see a doctor.
Breakfast.
This will perk everyone up.
Some of Aunt Fanny' s fresh- brewed grease.
Yummy!
Careful, it' s hot.
So, what are you guys doing today?
- We' re doing it.
- What about you?
Bigweld' s disappeared, and you' re sitting here.
That' s already been established.
- I gotta find out what happened to him.
- Hey, you want my advice?
- Sure.
- Forget it.
"Never try, never fail."
Those are the words I live by.
Crank, the idol of millions is gone, and no one seems to care.
There should be an angry mob out there.
What the...?
Wow, that was great, psychic friend.
Now say, "Money should be falling from the sky."
Say it.
Say it.
Sorry, folks, all sold out.
Nothing but upgrades from here on in.
But I like myself just the way I am.
- We can' t afford upgrades!
- Let' s get him!
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
Isn' t that the guy that fixed Fender' s neck?
Yeah, that guy fixes bots.
Yeah, that kid can help you.
Brace yourself.
You' re about to get popular.
Only those with insurance.
Everybody, come on.
Parts, man.
I need parts.
You don' t look that... bad.
- Hey, everybody, spare parts!
- Yeah!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What' s wrong with you robots?
You should all be ashamed of yourselves.
Why do you have two noses?
One' s for showing, one' s for blowing.
- Sorry.
- Hey, could you look at my arm?
- Nice grip.
- Like iron.
- I can' t get rid of this spare tire.
- I am losing my mind.
Back off, back off.
He' s got his own dreams that won' t come true.
See a need, fill a need.
Wait.
Who wants to get fixed?
Thanks, Rodney.
You' re number one.
Rodney!
Rodney!
Rodney!
Oh, yeah.
I have never felt so relaxed.
Say, do you mind giving me a little scratch between the shoulder blades?
There you...
Easy, tiger.
Hey!
Take it easy.
Hey, what are you trying to do, kill me?
Relax.
It' s me, your mommy.
- How did you get in here?
- I came up the air shaft.
I know you don' t like anybody here to see me.
- Well, what do you want?
- Someone' s fixing them.
- What?
- Someone is repairing outmodes...... and they are laughing at you.
- Who?
And are you sure they' re not laughing with me?
Yes.
So what if one crazy fanatic repairs a few outmodes?
Who cares?
Think.
Use those brains I stole for you.
Today, it' s one.
What about tomorrow, when everybody gets the idea this is okay?
We don' t need upgrades.
We want Bigweld. "
Then what happens to you?
Take it easy.
We' ve got to find out who this is and stop him.
Not stop him, crush him, destroy him.
And by the way, I brought you a little something for your desk.
- Is there anyone else waiting?
- Let me look.
- A few.
- "A few"?
What did you expect, Rodney?
Bigweld was gone.
Sweepers were on the loose, but then came Copperbottom.
I' m getting all static- y just thinking about it.
I' m not Bigweld.
These robots need parts.
Mail call.
Mail call.
Copperbottom, this one' s from your mom.
Oh, is there anything for me?
Oh, I got something for you.
That' s from my sister.
I recognize the handwriting.
Is anything wrong?
I' il say.
His father' s got one foot in the junkyard...... and if they can' t find new parts for him, he' s only got a few miles left.
Rodney, are you really worried about your dad?
Do you wanna go home?
Well, if I go home, I still can' t help him.
We' re out of parts.
We' ve gotta get to Bigweld.
He' s the only one that can fix this.
He' s trying to tell us something.
What is it, boy?
What' s wrong?
Bigweld is going...... dancing.
Of course, the Bigweld Ball.
You can' t have the Bigweld Ball without Bigweld.
Well, that' s it, then.
I' m going to the Bigweld Ball.
What?
That' s the fanciest party of the year.
You' il never get past the gate.
- Can I help you?
- I think maybe you can.
This is Count Roderick von Brokenzipper.
Formerly Count Velcro.
Where are the trumpets?
We were promised trumpets to announce the count' s arrival.
Sorry, Your Grace.
Beat me until you' re happy.
He' s happy.
And I' m not feeling too bad myself.
You' re not on the list.
- We' re what?
Once again.
Thank you.
Fine, we will go.
You' il explain to your superiors...... why we were not able to attend your little luau, barn dance, whatever it is.
But we' re leaving in a huff.
No, no.
No.
Please, go right in.
In fact, would the count like to hit me?
The count hit you?
The arrogance of some people.
I will hit you on his behalf.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Okay, let' s split up.
If you see Bigweld, come and find me.
If anything goes wrong, we' il signal each other.
What kind of signal do you want?
You want something kind of subtle, like:
Or:
Oh, how about this:
Ricola!
Subtle.
Let' s get to work.
A screwdriver, please.
Shaken, not stirred.
Yes, sir.
I' il have what he' s having.
You know, Cappy, it' s nice that you can see me like this, away from work.
See my more casual, fun- Ioving side.
Now, where were we?
Well, there are never any interesting men at these parties.
Hello, ladies.
Fender von Fender at your service.
Hi, I' m Loretta...... Geargrinder.
Anyone dressed as badly as you are must be an eccentric billionaire.
Ladies and gentlebots, now coming to the stage...... the top bot, the big bolt...... who' s your daddy?
Mr. Phineas T. Ratchet.
Thank you.
We now come to the point of the evening...... where I have the tremendous honor of introducing...
- Excuse me.
Sorry.... our beloved founder, Mr. Bigweld...... who, unfortunately, is unable to attend.
- What?
- He sends his apologies...... his love and a small box of assorted cookies.
- Not coming?
- And what are you doing here?
What have you done with Bigweld?
How come we don' t see him anymore, huh?
Okay.
Security, we have a party- crasher.
Yeah, that' s right, and I had to put all this junk on in order to get in here...... so that I could tell Bigweld that you are outmoding millions of bots.
And I know because I spend all day fixing them.
You.
Oh, my darling, that is the cry of the deep- doo- doo bird.
I must fly.
Take him for a drive...... and bring me back his exact weight in paper clips.
- No!
- No?
I' il escort him out.
You don' t wanna look bad in front of your people, do you?
- Good point.
- When I get back...... I' il show you my casual, fun- Ioving side.
Oh, you.
- Get moving.
- What?
What are you doing?
Saving your life.
- Come on.
- Let him go.
Let him go.
- Get out of here, you idiot.
- Fender, let' s go.
- You know him?
Fender, wait for me.
Wonderbot.
Get out of my way!
Hey, Tim, I' d like to see Mr. Bigweld.
Oh, you again.
Oh, that was amazing.
- So where do we go now?
- I' m taking you to the train station.
- What?
No way.
- You don' t know what you' re dealing with.
Ratchet will use your head for a hood ornament.
I' m not leaving until I find Bigweld.
- That' s not...
- Can' t you take me to him?
I must be out of my mind.
Au réservoir, my darling.
- Thanks for walking me home.
- Thanks for carrying me up that hill.
- Until tomorrow?
- I shall count the seconds.
So far, I' m up to four.
You crazy nut boy.
Crazy about you.
I' m singing in the oil
I' m singing in the oil
After all that work and toil
I' m just slipping in the oil
I know where I' ve been sent
I' m covered in lubricant
My life has turned around.
From now on, I' m a winner!
Stop, you' ve made a mistake.
You can' t do this.
Help.
Okay, we tried.
Let' s get out of here.
Something' s up.
Look at all these newspapers and this mail.
They probably stopped delivering these years ago.
Paper.
Late edition.
- You say something?
- Nice one of you.
Come on.
We gotta get you out of here.
Big, creaky door.
Perfect.
Look at this.
This is Bigweld' s actual workshop.
I recognize it from his old TV show.
Could you keep it down?
We' re not supposed to be here.
Do you know what these are?
These are Bigweld' s original invention designs.
- That' s his own writing.
- This is strange.
How come it just stops in the middle?
Look at this.
Remember, he used to have these on his show?
Rodney, I don' t know how to tell you this, but...
Why are they so dusty?
Wait, don' t.
This is much more elaborate than the ones on his show.
Rodney, what do we do?
I don' t know.
This is kind of a first for me.
- Yeah!
- It' s him.
- Who' s the king of the beach?
- Are you all right?
Well, considering I' m an old fat guy who just crashed to the floor...... I' m fantastic.
Now, who the heck are you?
I' m Rodney.
Oh, I thought you were the dominoes delivery boy.
Come on, let' s set them up again, only bigger.
Sir, is this what you' ve been working on?
This is why no one sees you?
Young man, nobody likes a chatterbox.
But there' s a terrible crisis, Mr. Bigweld.
We need to talk.
Son, I' ve gotta tell you, you' re making a lousy first impression.
Please, sir, he is your biggest fan.
In fact, he' s an inventor just like you.
- Well...
- Show him that thing you made.
A device?
A thingamajig?
Show Mr. Bigweld what you can do.
It' s okay.
Is that what it' s supposed to do?
It gets nervous under pressure...
Son, let me give you a good piece of advice.
- Yes?
- Give up.
What?
You' re telling me to quit?
I said "give up," but "quit" works just as good.
Is that what you did?
Is that why you' re sitting here...... letting Ratchet turn robots like my father into outmodes?
Kid, sometimes you just gotta know when you' re licked.
You can fix anything.
I used to think so.
To me, having the company was all about making life better.
With Ratchet, it was making money that came first.
I became old- fashioned, an outmode.
Go home, kid.
If he beat me, he' s gonna beat you.
The world you' re looking for no longer exists.
You missed it.
Find some other foolish dream.
Now, if you' il excuse me, I' m very, very...... very busy.
Yeah, I can see that.
All I ever wanted was to grow up to be like him.
Help.
Open the door.
Open the door.
Close the door.
Close the door!
Wow, look at all these parts.
It' s a smorgasbord.
Look at that.
So many things I' ve wanted all my life.
Oh, that' s pretty.
Okay, Mother, this way.
Let me look, please.
I can' t bear it.
No peeking, now.
It' s a surprise.
Oh, you are a wicked boy.
And look.
- For me?
- It' s got a full tank of gas.
If you' re ready to mow, she' s ready to go.
Has any mother ever had a better son?
By the way, I found out who' s been fixing those outmodes.
So tomorrow, these babies...... are gonna chop him up along with all his buddies...... and every other walking pile of junk I' m sick of looking at.
What' s that?
This is so wrong.
This is so wrong.
Help.
One- way.
Hi, Mom.
Oh, I' m doing fine.
How are you?
- And Dad?
- He' s right here.
I' il put him on.
Hey, buddy, how' s it going?
Hey, Dad.
How are you feeling?
Oh, fine, fine.
I...
I' ve just been a little under the weather.
No, we' re just having a little trouble...... finding your old man a replacement part, that' s all.
But let' s talk about you.
What kind of work are you doing?
What' s Bigweld like?
Did you meet him?
Yeah, I met him, but...
What' s wrong, son?
It' s not how we thought it was, Dad.
It' s not...
I can' t...
I see.
- I' m really sorry I let you down.
- No, no, no.
You could never let me down, Rodney.
Listen, I know it isn' t easy, Rodney...... but a dream that you don' t fight for...... can haunt you for the rest of your life.
Yeah, Dad.
It' s up to you, son.
- Your father loves you very much.
- I know.
With our Friends and Family plan, you can talk to him 500 minutes a month.
Free nights and weekends.
Yoo- hoo, Rodney!
Wait.
- Your suitcase.
- Thanks, Aunt Fanny, but I' m...
The others wanted to come and see you off too.
Well, why didn' t they?
Oh, they did.
Next time, let' s split a cab.
Who the heck is she?
I used to have a figure like that.
Hurry, come on.
One ticket to anywhere.
Fender?
I have a sister.
An ugly sister.
Hey, guess what.
It' s the sweepers.
Us.
- And guess who' s really behind it all.
- Ratchet.
You don' t wanna guess?
I ran all this way in heels.
- Come on, take a stab.
- Ratchet.
Ratchet!
Listen to me.
- We won' t last a week.
Settle down.
I got a plan.
- Let' s all get on that train.
- Come on.
Hey, wait a minute.
You' re all giving up?
- You started it.
- Well, I' m ending it.
My mistake was hoping that Bigweld would fight our battles.
Well, he won' t.
It' s up to us.
If we don' t do something about Ratchet, no one will.
Come on, let' s fight back.
Fighting never solved anything.
Quitting isn' t so productive either.
I gotta tell you.
It' s the big boy.
Oh, be still, my pump.
Kid, if you' re gonna fight, I' m going in with you.
You are?
Hey, who' s the dame with the sweet keister?
- But why?
I' m a big guy, and I like women with large...
No, no, no.
Why are you gonna help us?
Because I wanna grow up to be like you.
Then let' s do it.
Come on, gang.
Let' s give that Ratchet an old- school fix- it!
Oh, what a man.
Someone get a crane.
Mother, I' m an adult, okay?
So stop telling me how to kill Bigweld.
I' m doing it today...... how I want, where I want and with whatever I want.
Okay, boardroom, 10 minutes.
I want you both there.
Mr. Bigweld, should we come too?
No, no.
You stay here...... and watch Daddy' s limo.
- Yes, sir.
I' m going inside to kick some booty.
Hey, you know, your boyfriend here is a genius.
- What?
- Oh, he' s not my...
He is?
I am?
Thanks for still believing in me.
It' s good to be home.
Toodley- oodley!
I use the Brazilian wax.
It makes me feel like every day' s a fiesta.
Tell Mr. Ratchet his 10: 00 is here.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Bigweld, sir.
Mr. Bigweld, sir.
Oh, Mr. Bigweld.
No, no.
Tell him I' m not here.
- Tell him anything, just don' t let him in.
- Ratchet!
- I' il cut to the point.
- What happened?
Run out of dominoes?
I' il send you more.
- You' re fired!
On what grounds?
This company' s never been more profitable.
Profit, schmofit.
Now, get out.
No, wait, please listen to me.
You can' t do this to me.
This job is my life.
It means everything to me.
You don' t know what I' ve done to get here.
The lives I' ve ruined.
This isn' t helping me.
- Get me security.
- Wait, please.
Can' t I just make one more heartfelt plea?
Okay, what did you wanna say?
That.
Oh, my gosh.
I' m as crazy as my mother.
Take that fish to the chop shop and put my name on his parking space.
Let go of him.
Sure.
Listen, kid, it' s over.
You lost.
Bigweld is gonna be melted down into next seasors upgrades...... along with you, your moronic coffeepot and Cappy.
Such a waste.
Mr. Bigweld, are you okay?
I' m the prettiest girl at the Harvest Moon Ball.
I' il take that as a "no."
Out of the way!
Rodney.
Road trip!
Road trip!
Road trip!
You guys are so embarrassing.
Oh, that' s Rodney.
He' s in some kind of trouble.
I' ve gotta repair him.
Okay, I got your back.
Come on, we' ve gotta help Rodney.
- No, Piper, you stay here.
- No way.
Let' s be honest.
We' re headed for a huge butt- whupping.
Whatever happens to us, make something of yourself.
You' re the only thing I' ve got to leave behind.
Goodbye!
He' s right, Piper.
They' re headed for a huge butt- whupping.
Okay, got it!
Rodney, what' s going on?
Where are we?
You' re all right.
Okay, boys, we got them right where they want us.
Boost me up.
Watch your hands down there.
Rodney!
We' re here to save you!
How do you think it' s going so far?
The plug.
I gotta get to the other side.
We' re out of here!
The chop shop.
Game over.
- The game is not over.
This is our moment to shine.
This is where you show what you' re really made of.
It' s called "afraidium."
It tastes like chicken.
I didn' t know I could do that.
Rodney' s right.
I am tired of just complaining and never doing anything.
L...
I...
I wanna try.
I' m sorry.
I want to try.
Then you' re first.
First for what?
They want us to upgrade?
Then let' s upgrade.
Gasket, you' re a sick, twisted, evil robot.
I try.
Oh, good.
Company.
So you' re the little glob of tin who' s been making all the trouble.
Who are these losers?
- We, sir...
- I' m a woman.
Ouch.
We' ve come to rescue our friend, you evil bag of bolts.
And you will be defeated by the very outmodes...... that you scorned and defaced.
Yeah, because there' s seven of us and only one of you.
There' s seven of us and...
Eight, nine...
- Did you count that one?
- I think so.
Could you all stop moving around?!
It' s so frustrating!
I think I counted one of you twice!
While you' re at it, count these.
As soon as we' re done with you, these hit the streets.
This is the last day any outmode will ever see.
Did I miss the butt- whupping?
- No.
- Matter of fact, you' re a little bit early.
Rodney!
Rodney!
Rodney!
- Well, let' s get started.
- Testify, sister!
- Charge!
- Charge!
He' s got a steel chair.
But he' s back up into a neck- breaker.
He' s up to the top rope.
- That' s sure gonna leave a dent.
Say hello to my dimpled friend.
This is gonna get greasy!
- Are you thinking what I' m thinking?
- I sure am.
See a need, fill a need!
This isn' t what I was thinking at all.
What are you doing?
Get off me.
Let me go!
Do as I say.
Get off!
Ma!
My upgrades!
It' s all right, son.
You can shine no matter what you...
Just stop!
Come on, Rodney.
Let' s open the gates of Bigweld Industries forever.
Wait a minute.
There' s one thing I need to do first.
Herb!
- Honey, what are you doing here?
- It' s Rodney, honey.
Is he all right?
Come outside.
Hurry.
Copperbottom, where are you going?
What about the dishes?
Hey, get back here!
You' il never wash in this town again.
What is all this?
The whole town is out here.
- Rodney?
- Dad!
There' s someone I want you to meet.
- Is that...?
- That' s Bigweld, Dad...... the greatest robot in the world.
Besides you.
- I understand you need a few parts.
- Well, I' m not one to complain.
Well, then don' t.
I' ve brought enough parts to make two of you.
Ladies and gentlebots...... I came all this way...
Would you cut that out?
It' s very distracting.
Sorry.
Where was I?
Mr. And Mrs. Copperbottom, I came all this way...... to tell you in person that your son, Rodney...... the man who got me off my big titanium tochis...... is now my right- hand bot and my eventual successor.
Way to go, Rodney!
Oh, Mom.
Son.
Dad, I know you kind of felt bad when I was growing up...... that you couldn' t give me a lot of stuff.
But you gave me the most important thing:
You believed in me.
From the second you were born.
Well, Dad, now I want your dream to come true.
Dad, you always wanted to be a musician.
Now be one, for everyone to hear.
Good for you, Herb!
You did good!
- Good job!
- Way to go.
Now I' m sure I' ve got a heart, because it' s aching.
You' il have to forgive me.
I' m a little rusty.
Well, there goes our happy ending.
It' s a fusion of jazz and funk.
It' s called "junk."
I love you, Herb!
- Fender!
- Loretta, my darling.
Sorry.
I was on the list!
Wait!
Mr. Frank.
Mr. Frank?
Kraler.
Mr. Kraler.
Miep.
My good friends.
It is so good to see you home.
We had heard nothing.
I' m alone.
You must come home with us...... and rest now.
- You must stay with us.
No, I can' t stay in Amsterdam.
Mr. Frank, this is your home.
- Amsterdam is your home.
- It has too many memories.
Everywhere there' s something, Miep.
Everywhere.
Even seeing you and Mr. Kraler....
I shouldn' t talk to you like this, after all you did.
Why, we' d do it again.
Everything' s gone.
The book....
They took everything, except some papers.
We saved your letters and papers.
Please burn them.
Burn everything.
I told her...... if I got back here, I' d find her book.
Anne' s diary?
It' s where she left it.
"The 9th of July, 1 942." 1 942.
Is it possible, Miep?
Only three years ago?
"Dear Diary, since you and I are to be great friends...... I will start by telling you all about myself.
My name is Anne Frank.
I am 1 3 years old.
I was born in Germany, but since my family is Jewish...... we emigrated to Holland when Hitler came to power.
Things went well for us until the war came and the German occupation.
Then things got very bad for the Jews. "
You could not do this and you could not do that.
We had to wear yellow stars.
I had to turn in my bike.
I couldn 't go to a Dutch school anymore.
I couldn 't go to the movies or ride in an automobile...... or even on a streetcar.
And a million other things.
But somehow, we children still managed to have fun.
This morning, Father woke me at 5: 00...... and told me to hurry and get dressed.
We were going into hiding.
I was to put on as many clothes as I could.
It would look too suspicious if we walked along carrying suitcases.
We were going to disappear...... vanish into thin air.
I' m living a great adventure.
Three other people were coming in with us.
Father knew them.
We had never met them.
- Something' s happened.
They had a 3 mile walk.
PETER:
- They' ve been arrested, I know.
Will you stop that?
Father.
We' re here.
You see?
VAN DAAN:
Hello.
- Mrs. Van Daan.
- Mr. Frank.
Peter.
There were too many Green Police on the streets.
We took the long way around.
Did you introduce yourself?
My daughter Anne.
My wife, Edith.
Margot.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.
Oh, and this is our son, Peter.
So, now, please let us take off some of these clothes.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Kraler.
Morning, Mr. Kraler.
- Mr. Frank.
You' re all here.
That is good.
- We hoped to have everything in order.
- Please, don' t even think of it.
We' il have leisure to arrange everything ourselves.
- Brought sandwiches for lunch.
- Thank you, Miep.
The canned goods are here, and your beans and potatoes.
- I' il get you ration books this afternoon.
- Ration books?
If they see our names on ration books, they' il know we' re here.
Don' t worry.
It won' t be your names that' il be on them.
ANNE:
The Westertoren!
- Anne!
No!
You must never touch a curtain.
Never.
No one must ever touch a curtain, day or night.
If someone on the streets should look up or someone should see...... we would be lost.
Remember, it' s not only our lives at stake...... but Miep' s and Mr. Kraler' s.
FRANK:
Thank you.
Miep or I will be up each day to bring you food and news.
Come, Miep, we must go.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr. Kraler.
How can we thank you?
I never thought I' d live to see the day when a man like Mr. Frank...... would have to go into hiding.
When you think of it....
Goodbye.
Thank you, Mr. Kraler.
Goodbye.
EDlTH:
Anne!
- It' s all right, I have on three more.
Excuse me, Mr. Frank.
- What do they mean, "1 3 minutes"?
- Before workmen come.
Now...... while the men are in the building below, we must be quiet.
Every sound can be heard down there, in the offices and in the workrooms too.
The men come at about 8: 30.
They leave at about 5: 30.
So to be perfectly safe, from 8 a. m. until 6 p. m...... we must move about up here only when absolutely necessary...... and then in stockinged feet.
We must not speak above a whisper or run any water.
We cannot use the sink or even, forgive me, the W. C.
No trash must ever be --
[SlREN APPROACHlNG]
No trash, which might reveal someone' s living here.
Not even a potato peeling.
We must burn everything in the stove at night.
This is the way that we must live until it is over, if we are to survive.
Until it is over.
After 6: 00, we can move about.
We can talk and laugh...... have our supper, read, play games, just as we would at home.
Now it would be wise if we all went to our rooms...... and were settled before 8: 00.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan, you' re upstairs.
I regret there' s no place up there for Peter.
But he' il be here, near us.
- And where am l?
- You and Margot will be in there.
FRANK:
Yes?
Where do you sleep?
This room is our bedroom.
Oh, no, no.
You take the upstairs.
We' il sleep down here.
I' ve thought this out.
It' s the best arrangement.
The only arrangement.
Edith?
You must have some rest, dear.
You didn' t close your eyes last night.
Now, go in the girls' room.
- Well, how about Anne?
- I feel fine.
I' m going to help Father.
This way, Mrs. Van Daan.
Excuse me.
Up here.
Mr. Frank?
FRANK:
Peter?
- I have time to get water for my cat?
You' ve a cat?
Go ahead, but be quick.
- You only have about five minutes.
- He couldn' t live without that cat.
I didn' t know you had a cat.
I love cats.
What' s its name?
- Mouschi.
- What is it?
Mouschi.
A him or her?
- It' s a tom.
It doesn' t like strangers.
- Then I' il have to stop being a stranger.
PETER:
No.
You ought to have him fixed, to keep him from fighting.
What a nice cat.
Where do you go to school?
ANNE:
That' s where Margot and I go.
- Yeah, I know.
- I' ve never seen you around.
- I used to see you sometimes.
- You did?
Why didn' t you ever come over?
Oh, I don' t know.
I' m sort of a lone wolf.
You can' t be a lone wolf here.
I wonder what our friends will say when we don' t show up today.
I had a date with Sanne.
Do you know Sanne de Vries?
- No.
Sanne' s my best friend.
She' s thin like me.
They always yell at us:
"Anne and Sanne, the skinny bananas."
You took off your star.
That' s right.
You can' t do that.
They' il arrest you if you go out without your star.
Who' s going out?
- Help me.
- I' m helping.
- What are you going to do with it?
- Burn it.
It' s funny, I don' t think I could burn mine.
- I don' t know why.
You couldn' t?
Something they make you wear so they can kick you around.
I know.
But after all...... it is the Star of David, isn' t it?
Annele, it' s almost 8: 00.
Don' t you wanna sit with us?
It' il be a long day.
No, thanks.
This is fine.
You won' t forget to take off your shoes, will you?
Peter...... it' s nice to have you with us.
Yes, Mr. Frank.
See you later.
[CHURCH BELLS RlNGlNG]
It' s comforting that Mr. Kraler and his secretary...... are down there below us, in the office.
Our protectors, we call them.
I asked Father what would happen to them...... if anyone found out they were hiding us.
Father said they would suffer the same fate that we would.
We are over an old spice factory.
You can smell the spices all through the building.
I read A Tale of Two Cities through in that first day.
"It is a far, far better thing I do...... than I have ever done.
It is a far, far better rest that I go to...... than I have ever known.
The end. "
It was the saddest book I ever read.
It is us, Miep and Kraler.
Good evening, Mr. Kraler.
Good evening, Miep.
Good evening, Annele.
- Oh, Mr. Frank.
- Yes?
- This is the box you asked for.
- Thanks.
Oh, my dear friends, you were all so quiet up here.
- I thought you' d gone out for a walk.
Can you imagine me?
I didn' t talk.
I hardly moved for one whole day.
Wish they could hear that at school.
Mouschi!
Mouschi!
Peter!
Peter.
Mouschi.
EDlTH:
Annie!
- Annele!
- Peter, I' m warning you.
Please, quiet.
Margot.
Margot!
- What are these?
- You don' t have to whisper now.
- There you are.
- He' s such a nice cat.
Thank you.
You' re welcome.
Annele.
Will you open it, please?
Know how I' m going to think of it here?
As a boarding house, a very peculiar boarding house.
Father, my film stars!
I was wondering where they were.
And Queen Wilhelmina.
How wonderful.
There' s something more.
Go on, look further.
A diary.
I' ve never had a diary.
And I' ve always wanted one.
A pencil?
I' m going downstairs to get a pencil.
- Anne, no!
- There' s nobody down there.
Doesn' t matter.
Don' t go beyond that door.
- Never?
- Never.
I' m sorry, Anne, it isn' t safe.
FRANK:
It' il be hard, I know that.
But always remember there are no walls, no locks...... no bolts that anyone can put on your mind.
As a matter of fact, just between us, Annele...... being here has certain advantages.
For instance...... remember that battle with your mother about overshoes?
Remember?
What happened?
In the end, you had to wear them.
Now, for as long as we are here, you won' t have to wear overshoes.
Isn' t that good?
And the piano.
You won' t have to practice it.
I tell you...... this is going to be a fine life for you.
It' s an odd idea for someone like me to keep a diary.
Not only because I have never done so before...... but because it seems to me, neither I, nor for that matter anyone else...... will be interested in the unbosomings of a 13- year- old schoolgirl.
Still, what does that matter?
I want to write, but more than that...... I want to bring out all kinds of things...... that lie buried deep in my heart.
First of all, I expect I should be describing...... what it' s like to go into hiding.
But I don 't really know yet myself.
I only know it' s funny never to be able to go outdoors.
Never to breathe fresh air.
Never to run and shout and jump.
Wednesday, the 23rd of September, 1942.
The news of the war is good.
Stalingrad is still holding out.
The Russian offensive continues in the Moscow area.
- It' s safe now.
- Whee!
- Anne!
- l 'm first for the W. C.
- Six o' clock, Margot.
School is over.
- Where are my shoes?
- Have you seen my shoes?
- What shoes?
- You' re gonna be sorry.
- I am?
- Annie, dear.
- Wait till I get you.
I' m waiting.
ANNE:
Peter!
- Annie!
Peter!
Peter, where are you going?
- Gonna give Mouschi his dinner.
- Peter!
Annie, dear...... you shouldn' t play like that with Pete.
That' s not dignified.
Who wants to be dignified?
I don' t wanna be dignified!
You complain I don' t treat you like a grownup, but when I do, you resent it.
I only want some fun.
I don' t know what' s the matter with that boy.
Give him a little time.
He isn' t used to girls.
Time?
Isn' t two months time?
I could cry.
And what about Miep?
She' s usually so prompt.
- Margot, come and dance with me.
- I' ve got more work to do, Anne.
You know, we' re going to forget how to dance.
When we get out, we won' t remember a thing.
- Where is Peter?
Where would he be?
With his cat.
He hasn' t finished his lessons, has he?
Peter.
- Peter!
- What is it?
Your mother says to come out.
I' m giving Mouschi his dinner.
You know what your father says about wasting time with that cat.
- I haven' t looked at him since lunch.
- I' m only telling you.
I' il feed him.
- You stay out of here.
And I mean out.
Is that any way for you to talk to your little girlfriend?
Mother, I asked you...
-... would you please not say that?
- Look, he' s blushing.
- He' s blushing.
- Please, I' m not, but --
- Leave me alone.
- Like it' s something to be ashamed of.
Nothing to be ashamed of to have a girlfriend.
That' s crazy.
She' s only 1 3.
So what?
It' s just perfect.
Your father' s 1 0 years older than me.
Mr. Frank, I warn you...... if this war lasts much longer, we' re gonna be related.
- Mazel tov.
- I haven' t seen my cat since lunch.
I' m giving Mouschi his dinner.
My little Mouschi.
I couldn' t live without my precious Mouschi.
You wonderful cat, you.
All right, Miss Quack- Quack.
- What' s that?
- Miss Quack- Quack!
- You!
You talk so much they call you Miss Quack- Quack.
You' re the most intolerable boy I ever met!
Quack, quack, quack!
- Ooh!
Anne, dear, you' re hot.
- You' re warm.
Are you all right?
- Mother, please.
- You don' t have a fever, do you?
- No.
You know we can' t call a doctor here, ever.
There' s only one thing to do, watch carefully.
Prevent an illness before it comes.
Let me see your tongue.
- Mother, this is perfectly absurd.
- Anne, dear, don' t be such a baby.
Let me see your tongue.
Otto.
Anne, you hear your mother, don' t you?
Come on, open up.
Quack.
Annie.
- Otto.
- Anne.
You' re all right.
I think there' s nothing the matter with our Anne that a ride on her bike...... or a visit with her friend Sanne de Vries wouldn' t cure.
Isn' t that so, Anne?
I keep wishing that Peter was a girl instead of a boy.
Then I' d have someone to talk to.
With all the boys in the world...... why did I have to get locked up with him?
Is it someone?
- ls it Miep?
It' s strange we don' t hear.
Maybe she got hurt.
- She' il come.
I wish she' d get here.
I' m going crazy without cigarettes.
Anne, you got "excellent" in your history paper...
-... and "very good" in Latin.
- Yes, but how about algebra?
Well, I have a confession to make.
Up until now, I managed to stay ahead of you in algebra.
Today, you caught up with me.
We' il leave it to Margot to correct.
- lsn' t algebra vile, Father?
- Vile.
- How did I do?
- Excellent, of course.
Anne, please.
Your French composition today, Margot, was just wonderful.
- Mrs. Van Daan, may I try it on?
- No, Annie.
It' s all right, really.
But please be careful with it.
My father gave me this coat the year before he died.
He always bought me the best money could buy.
Mrs. Van Daan, did you have a lot of boyfriends before you were married?
Annie, that' s a personal question.
It' s not courteous to ask personal questions.
I don' t mind.
Anneke, our house was always swarming with boys.
- When I was a young girl -- - Oh, no, not again.
Shut up!
One summer, we had a big house in Hilversum.
The boys....
The boys would come buzzing around like bees around a jam pot.
When I was 1 7....
Well, we were wearing short skirts then, and I had such good- looking legs.
I still have.
I may not be as pretty as I used to be...... but I still have my legs.
How about it, Mr. Frank?
All right, all right.
We see them.
I' m not asking you, I' m asking Mr. Frank.
- Mother, for heaven sakes.
- Oh, I embarrass you too, do l?
I only hope the girl you marry has as good.
Anneke, my father used to worry with all the boys hanging around.
And he used to say to me:
"lf any of those boys get fresh, you just say to him:
'Remember, Mr. So- and- So, remember, I am a lady.' "
Look at you, talking that way with her.
Don' t you know she puts it in her diary?
So what if she does?
I' m only telling the truth.
Haven' t you finished?
- No.
- Oh, the thinker.
Leave him alone.
A hopeless case.
PETRONELLA:
Don' t talk like that.
It' s just you haven' t got anyone to help you...... Iike Father helps Anne and me.
But if l -- Well, if we could help....
What about it, Peter?
Would you like to study with us?
Shall we make our school coeducational?
Thanks, yes.
FRANK:
Yes?
You are an angel, an absolute angel.
Why didn' t I meet you before I met that one there?
I think it might be better if you went into your room, Peter, to work.
Excuse me.
Peter, you listen to Mr. Frank.
Mr. Frank is a highly educated man.
It' s after 8: 00.
Where are they?
- At least one of them should' ve come.
Don' t worry.
Don' t tell me.
I know something' s wrong.
Isn' t it bad enough here without you sprawling all over?
If you didn' t smoke, you wouldn' t be so irritable.
- Am I smoking?
- You already smoked all the cigarettes.
- Miep only brought me one package.
- It' s a filthy habit...
VAN DAAN:
Oh, stop it.
Please.
You' re smoking up all our money.
Will you shut up?!
And what are you staring at?
I thought only children quarreled.
This isn' t a quarrel, it' s a discussion.
I never heard children so rude before.
- I, rude?
- Yes!
- Annie, drink your milk.
- You' ve been spoiled.
What you need is a good spanking.
Remember, Mr. So- and- So, I am a lady.
You' re the most aggravating -- Why aren' t you nice and quiet...... Iike your sister, Margot?
Why do you show off all the time?
Let me give you a little advice.
Men don' t like that in a girl.
Do you know that?
A man likes a girl who' il listen to him.
A girl who cooks and sews and cleans.
I' d open my veins.
I am going to be remarkable.
I' m going to Paris...
-... to study music and art.
- Yeah, yeah.
I' m going to be an actress or a writer or a dancer.
ANNE:
I' m sorry.
You clumsy little fool!
- My father gave me this coat!
- I' m so sorry.
All ruined, and what do you care?
You ruined it!
I could kill you!
I could just kill you!
Petronella.
Petronella, it' s only a coat.
Only a coat.
Anne, you must not behave in that way.
It was an accident.
Anyone can have an accident.
I don' t mean that.
I mean the answering back.
You must not answer back.
They' re our guests.
You don' t hear Margot getting into arguments with them.
Try to be like Margot.
And have them walk all over me the way they do her?
No, thanks.
I don' t know what happens to you, Annie.
If I had ever talked to my mother as you talk to me....
Things have changed, Mother.
People aren' t like that anymore.
"Yes, Mother.
No, Mother.
Anything you say, Mother. "
I' ve got to fight things out for myself.
Make something of myself.
It isn' t necessary to fight to do it.
Margot doesn' t --
"Margot." That' s all I hear.
"Why aren' t you like Margot?"
Everything she does is right, and everything I do is wrong.
You' re all against me, and you worst of all.
I don' t know how we can go on living this way.
I can' t say a word to Annie, she flies at me.
You know Anne.
In a half an hour, she' il be laughing and joking.
And them.
I told your father it wouldn' t work with two families.
But no, no, he had to ask them.
Every time I hear that sound, my heart stops.
It' s Miep.
Father.
FRANK:
It' s Miep.
EDlTH:
Thank you.
Is it Miep?
- Yes.
- At last, I' il have some cigarettes.
- Miep' s here.
I can' t tell you how sorry I am about the coat.
Don' t worry.
- Hello.
- Miep.
Mr. Kraler.
When Mr. Kraler comes, the sun begins to shine.
- Dirk has had to leave.
- Dirk is Miep' s fiancé.
He had to go into hiding in the country to escape a labor call- up...... but he has let me have the radio for you.
- He shouldn' t have.
- It was too dangerous.
Look!
Our blessed radio.
It gives us our eyes and ears out into the world.
We listen to the German station only for good music.
The Axis forces in the Western....
MAN ON RADlO: -- ceaseless attacks by land and air forces are now in full retreat.
The 8th army continues to advance.
It' s good.
All right, Peter.
Now, let' s see what they have to say about the Nazis, huh?
Berlin.
Must we listen?
All right, Peter, that' s enough.
The Green Police, they' ve found us.
This way, Mr. Dussel.
It' s Kraler.
KRALER:
Bless them.
They' re here.
Kraler?
Open, please.
- Well, we had a visitor last night.
- We had a visitor last night.
- Y es, yes.
- A thief.
- It was a thief?
- Did you hear him?
- Yes.
- He was right under you.
In the office right under here.
We did not know.
We thought it was the police.
- Are you sure, Miep?
- You were, of course, quiet?
We hardly breathed all night.
- That is good.
It was close.
- Too close.
He went through everything, the desk and the files.
And he found the safe, but he could not get it open.
He' s looking for our ration card supply from the underground.
- Somebody knows.
- They are in that safe.
They' il come back.
You should get rid of that safe.
Get it out of here.
Yes, put a sign on the door:
"Burglars do not come back.
The safe is gone. "
- Jokes, yeah.
- Mr. Frank, I must talk to you.
- Of course.
- Maybe we should get rid of the radio.
Burn it.
If the Green Police found that radio....
Then they' d find her diary.
We' il burn that too.
Not my diary.
My diary goes, I go with it.
- Where is it?
- Mr. Van Daan.
If they find us, they might as well find the diary, the radio....
- Usually, I try to bring good news.
- Yes, I know.
But something has happened.
A man came to me.
He told me that he has a Jewish friend, a dentist.
He begged me, could I find him a hiding place?
So I have come to you.
It is a terrible thing to ask of you, living the way you are...
-... but could you take him in?
- Well, of course we will.
- His name is Jan Dussel.
I think I know him.
I think it' s fine to have him.
- Thank you.
Where?
- There' s so little food as it is -- - We can stretch the food a little.
He can have my bed.
- No, thank you.
Margot will move in with us, and he can have her bed.
I' il get my things out.
Mr. Dussel.
Don' t bump your head.
Come in, Mr. Dussel.
This is Mr. Frank.
- Mr. Otto Frank?
- Yes.
Let me have your things, please.
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
I leave you in good hands.
Mr. Dussel, I must return your coat.
- What can I say to thank you?
- Mr. Kraler and Miep...... they' re our lifeline.
Without them, we couldn' t live.
You make us seem very heroic.
It isn' t that at all.
- We simply don' t like the Nazis.
- I know, I know.
"Nobody' s going to tell us Dutchmen what to do with our damn Jews."
We' il be up tomorrow, see if they' re treating you right.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr. Kraler.
Goodbye, Mr. Dussel.
Goodbye, Miep.
- Welcome, Mr. Dussel.
- Thank you.
This is my wife, Edith.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.
Their son, Peter.
My daughters, Margot and Anne.
Hello, Anne.
- How do you do?
- Margot.
- How do you do?
Please, Mr. Dussel, sit down.
Thank you.
I' m dreaming, I know it.
Mr. Otto Frank here.
You' re not in Switzerland, then?
Someone said that you had escaped.
- And you' ve been here all this time?
- Ever since July.
Did Mr. Kraler warn you you won' t get much to eat here?
You can imagine.
Three ration cards among the seven of us.
Now you make eight.
Mr. Van Daan, you don' t realize what' s happening outside...... that you should warn me of a thing like that.
You don' t realize what' s going on, right here in Amsterdam.
Every day, hundreds of Jews disappear.
They surround the block.
They search house by house.
Every day, children come home from school to find their parents gone.
Hundreds are being deported.
People that you and I know: the Hallensteins, the Wessels.
Oh, no.
You get your call- up notice:
"Come to the station on such and such a day and hour.
Bring only what you can carry. "
If you don' t, they come drag you from your home...... and ship you off to Mauthausen, the death camp.
We didn' t know that things had got so much worse.
Forgive me for speaking so.
Do you know the de Vries?
They' re gone.
Sanne and I are in the same class.
Sanne is my best -- My best friend.
She returned home from school to find her parents gone.
She was alone for two days, and then they came and took her away.
Gone?
Yes, with all the others.
Oh, no.
People named Meyerberg, they lived near us.
- Do you know --?
- We should put this off.
I' m sure Mr. Dussel would like to get settled.
Would you take Mr. Dussel to his room now?
If you' il come with me, Mr. Dussel.
Forgive me if I haven' t expressed my gratitude.
This has been such a shock to me.
I always thought of myself as Dutch.
I was born in Holland.
My father was born in Holland, and my grandfather.
And now, after all these years....
If you will excuse me.
It' s so different from what Mr. Kraler tells us.
Mr. Kraler says that things are improving.
I like it better the way Kraler tells it.
Good night.
- Say good night!
- Good night, Mother.
Good night, Mr. Frank.
Good night.
Do you have any children, Mr. Dussel?
No, I never married.
- Have you no family at all?
No one.
How dreadful.
You must be terribly lonely.
I' m used to it.
I don' t think I could ever get used to it.
Didn' t you even have a pet?
- A cat or a dog?
- No.
No, no, I have an allergy to furbearing animals.
- Gives me asthma.
- Oh, dear.
What?
Peter has a cat.
- He has?
He has it here?
- Yes.
We hardly ever see it.
- He keeps it in his room all the time.
- Yeah.
- I' m sure it' il be all right.
- Well, I hope so.
Yes.
I hope I won' t be too much of a bother to you, Mr. Dussel.
No.
I seem to be able to get everyone' s back up.
Oh, I always get along very well with young people.
My patients all bring their children to me...... because they know I get along well with them.
So don' t you worry about that.
Thank you, Mr. Dussel.
Good night.
I' il be back.
Good night, Mr. Dussel.
Be careful.
Sanne.
Sanne?
Sanne!
Save me!
Save me!
No, no!
- No!
DUSSEL:
Stop it!
Stop it!
Save me.
Hush, Annie, hush.
It' s all right.
Please, Mr. Dussel, turn on the light.
It was just a dream.
You' re here, safe, you see?
Something must be done with that child.
Yelling like that.
Who knows who might be in the street?
She' s endangering our lives.
Mr. Dussel, after all, Anne is not exactly a trained frontline soldier.
Please, Mr. Dussel, go back to bed.
She' il be herself in a minute or two, won' t you, Annie?
Hmph.
Excuse me.
I' m going to the W. C., the one room where there' s peace.
Go back to bed now.
Would you like some water?
Was it a very bad dream?
Perhaps if you told me?
I' d rather not talk about it.
Try to sleep, then.
- I' il sit right here beside you.
You don' t have to.
But I' d like to stay with you.
Very much, really.
I' d rather you didn' t.
Good night --
You' il be all right?
There' s nothing that you want?
Will you please ask Father to come?
Yes, of course, Anne, dear.
She asked for you.
- Edith....
Go to her, Otto.
She' s still trembling with fear.
She wants nothing of me.
She pulled away when I leaned down to kiss her.
Anne.
It' s just a phase.
All girls turn to their fathers at this age.
They give all their love to their fathers.
EDlTH:
You didn' t shut me out.
So....
- Do you want me to read to you?
- No, just sit with me for a minute.
Was I awful?
- Do you think anyone outside heard me?
- No.
Now, lie down quietly so.
Like this.
Now try to sleep.
I' m a terrible coward.
I' m so disappointed in myself.
I think I' m really grown- up...... and then something happens, and I run to you like a baby.
I love you, Father.
I don' t love anyone but you.
- Annele.
Annele.
It' s true.
You' re the only one I love.
I' ve been thinking about it for a long time.
It' s fine.
It' s fine to have you tell me that you love me...... but I' d be much happier if you said that you loved your mother as well.
She needs your help so much.
Your love.
We have nothing in common.
She doesn' t understand me.
Whenever I try to explain my views on life, she asks me if I' m constipated.
You hurt her very much just now.
She' s crying.
She is in there crying.
Oh, Father, I was horrible, wasn' t l?
What' s the matter with me?
Tell me.
Don' t say it' s just a phase.
Help me.
There is so little that we parents can do to help our children, Annie.
We can only try to set a good example, point the way.
The rest you must do yourself.
I' m trying.
Really, I am.
Every night, I think back over all the things I did that day that were wrong.
Like putting the wet mop in Mrs. Van Daan' s bed.
And now this with Mother.
I say to myself, "That was wrong."
And I make up my mind never to do that again.
Never.
I may do something worse, but I' il never do that again.
I have a nicer side, Father...... but I' m scared to show it.
I' m afraid people will laugh at me.
So the mean Anne comes to the outside...... and the good Anne stays in the inside.
And I keep on trying to switch them around...... have the good Anne outside...... and the bad Anne inside.
It would be what I' d like to be.
And might be.
If only....
She' s asleep.
Thursday, the 29th of October, 1942.
Mr. Dussel and I had a great battle yesterday.
Yes, Mr. Dussel.
According to him, nothing, I repeat, nothing, is right about me.
While he was going on at me, I thought:
"Someday, I' m going to give you such a smack...... that you 'il fly right up to the ceiling."
Why is it that every grownup thinks he knows the way to bring up children?
Particularly the grownups that haven 't any.
Monday, the 9th of November, 1942.
Wonderful news!
The Allies have landed in Africa!
That measure of....
MAN ON RADlO: -- which they have so often meted out to others.
Ah, this is not the end.
It is not even the beginning of the end.
No, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.
The air raids are getting worse.
The British planes come over, day and night, on their way to Germany.
It' s too much.
It' s just too much.
Suppose they hit this house?
What will we do?
We can' t go out in the street.
What will we do?
If they hit this house, your worries will be over.
That big explosion, an English plane fell right in this block!
Peter.
Peter!
It' s far away from here.
Please don' t.
Just look at them.
Mrs. Van Daan, this should be music to your ears.
- Music?
Of course.
The more planes they send, the sooner the war will be over.
- The sooner we' il be home again.
- I don' t believe it' il ever be over.
Do you know what I' d like right now?
A cup of tea.
Oh, yes, please.
You can' t have tea, then, for breakfast.
If you have it now, you won' t have any tomorrow.
- I don' t care.
- Neither do l.
Me too, please.
How about you, Mr. Dussel?
Tea now or tomorrow morning?
- Tomorrow morning.
- Sure?
Sure.
I' il take mine now.
The skylight!
Edith, come!
Oh, Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
"Praised be thou, Lord, ruler of the universe...... who' s sanctified us with thy commandments...... and bidden us kindle the Hannukah lights.
Praised be thou, O, Lord, our God, ruler of the universe...... who wrought wondrous deliverances for our fathers in days of old.
Praised be thou, O, Lord, our God, ruler of the universe...... that thou hast given us life and sustenance...... and brought us to this happy season. "Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Monday, the 7th of December, 1942.
The Hannukah holiday came early this year.
"We kindle this Hannukah light...... to celebrate the wonderful deeds wrought through the zeal...... with which God filled the hearts of the heroic Maccabees 2000 years ago.
They fought against indifference...... against tyranny and oppression, and they restored our temple to us.
May these lights remind us that we should ever look to God...... whence cometh our help. "Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
"I lift up mine eyes unto the mountains from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved.
He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
He that keepeth lsrael doth neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.
He shall keep thy soul.
The Lord shall guard thy going out and thy coming in...... from this time forth and forevermore. "Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
May I have the hats, please?
Thank you.
Very nice, very nice.
- That was very moving.
- It isn' t over yet.
VAN DAAN:
Where are you going?
There' s lots more.
Songs and presents.
EDlTH:
Not this year, unfortunately.
But always on Hannukah, everyone gives presents.
Everyone.
- That' s right.
- Like our St. Nicholas Day.
St. Nicholas Day.
No, not like St. Nicholas Day.
What kind of Jew doesn' t know Hannukah?
I remember particularly the candles.
First one, as we have tonight.
The second night, two.
The next night, three, and so on, until eight candles are burning.
When there are eight candles, it' s truly beautiful.
What I remember best are the presents we used to get, eight days of presents.
Each day, they got better and better.
We are all here, alive.
That' s present enough.
No, it isn' t.
Every second bastard born is fathered by a priest.
But in Utopia that couldn' t be.
For why?
- For there the priests are very holy.
- Therefore very few.
Is it anything interesting, Matthew?
I don' t know.
- Bless you too, Matthew.
To be sure, we have some holy priests in England.
- Oh, name some.
- Brother James.
Man' s a simpleton.
It' s from Cardinal Wolsey.
What' s he want?
- Me.
- When?
Now.
In Hampton Court?
You won' t be there by midnight.
- The King' s business.
- Queen' s business.
Mistress Anne Boleyn' s business.
Well, it' s all the Cardinal' s business.
That' s very true.
And when the Cardinal calls, you all come running, day or night.
What is the man?
A butcher' s son.
Chancellor of England, too.
No, that' s his office.
What' s the man?
Surely, Your Grace, when a man rises so high and so swiftly...... we must think he was misplaced in his origins.
That, at least, was the opinion of Aristotle and....
A butcher' s son and looks it.
His looks, yes, I give you his looks.
What was that you said, Richard?
Nothing, Sir Thomas, it was out of place.
And Wolsey' s still a butcher.
And you' re a member of the King' s High Council, not an errand boy.
That is why I must go.
The Duke would go if the Cardinal called him.
I might.
I' il be back for breakfast.
Go to bed.
"Dear Lord, give us rest tonight, or if we must be wakeful, cheerful.
For Christ' s sake.
Amen. "
And bless our lord, the King.
- "And bless our lord, the King."
- Amen!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Goodnight, Your Grace.
Keep clear of Wolsey, Thomas.
He' s a frightened man.
- Who is that?
- A young friend from Cambridge.
- What' s he want?
- What do they all want?
A position.
- Can you give him a position?
- Do you recommend him?
No.
- Sir Thomas.
- Did you recommend me?
- No.
Richard, I may have a position for you.
- What?
What position?
- Not now, Richard.
Tomorrow.
For you all, boatman.
Thank you, sir.
Sir Thomas is here, Your Grace.
Sir Thomas.
Master Cromwell.
You opposed me in the Council this morning, Thomas.
Yes, Your Grace.
- You were the only one.
- Yes, Your Grace.
You' re a fool.
Thank God there is only one fool on the Council.
Why did you oppose me?
I thought Your Grace was wrong.
A matter of conscience.
You' re a constant regret to me, Thomas.
If you could just see facts flat on...... without that horrible moral squint.
With a little common sense, you could have made a statesman.
The King.
Where' s he been?
Do you know?
I, Your Grace?
Spare me your discretion.
He' s been to play in the muck again.
He' s been to Mistress Anne Boleyn.
More, are you going to help me?
If Your Grace will be specific.
You' re a plodder!
All right, we' il plod.
The King wants a son.
What are you going to do about it?
I' m very sure the King needs no advice from me on what to do about it.
Thomas, we' re alone.
I give you my word, there' s no one here.
I didn' t suppose there was, Your Grace.
Do you favour a change of dynasty?
Do you think two Tudors are sufficient?
For God' s sake, Your Grace!
Then he needs a son.
I repeat, what are you going to do about it?
I pray for it daily.
God' s death, he means it.
That thing out there, at least she' s fertile.
- But she' s not his wife.
- No, Catherine' s his wife...... and she' s barren as a brick.
Are you going to pray for a miracle?
There are precedents.
All right.
Pray by all means.
But in addition to prayer there is effort.
And my effort is to secure a divorce.
Have I your support, or have I not?
The Pope gave a dispensation, so that the King might marry...... his brother' s widow for state reasons.
We are to ask the Pope to dispense with his dispensation, also for state reasons?
I don' t like plodding, Thomas.
Well?
Then, clearly all we have to do is to approach His Holiness and ask him.
I think we might influence the decision of His Holiness.
By argument?
Argument certainly.
And pressure.
Pressure, applied to the Church?
The Church has its church property.
Pressure.
No, Your Grace, I' m not going to help you.
Then goodnight, Master More.
Let the dynasty die with Henry Vill and we' il have dynastic wars again.
Blood- witted barons ramping the country from end to end.
Is that what you want?
Very well.
England needs an heir.
Certain measures, perhaps regrettable...... perhaps not, there' s much in the Church which needs reformation, Thomas.
All right, regrettable.
But necessary to get us an heir.
Now, explain how you, as a councillor of England, can obstruct these measures...... for the sake of your own private conscience.
I think that when statesmen forsake their own private conscience...... for the sake of their public duties...... they lead their country by a short route to chaos.
And we shall have my prayers to fall back on.
You' d like that, wouldn' t you?
To govern the country with prayers?
Yes, I should.
I' d like to be there when you try.
Who will wear this after me?
Who' s our next chancellor?
You?
Fisher?
Suffolk?
- Fisher for me.
- Aye, but for the King?
What about my secretary, Master Cromwell?
Cromwell.
He' s a very able man.
But?
Me rather than Cromwell.
Then, come down to earth.
Until you do...... you and I are enemies.
As Your Grace wishes.
As God wills.
Perhaps, Your Grace.
More!
You should have been a cleric!
Like yourself, Your Grace?
Goodnight, Sir Thomas.
- What' s this?
- From some grateful poor folk, in Leicester.
- Leicester?
- You do more good than you know, sir.
My daughter has a case, sir, in the Court of Poor Man' s Causes.
Baked apples, sir.
To sweeten my judgement.
I' il give your daughter the same judgement I would give my own.
A fair one, quickly.
Bless you, sir.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you.
Good evening, Sir Thomas.
- I' il read it.
- It' s an awkward case.
- I could illuminate it for you -- - I' il read it.
Just a moment or two....
Boat!
Sir?
Chelsea, sir?
Chelsea.
I expect you' il make it worth my while, sir.
- You' ve got a licence?
- Bless you, yes sir, I' ve got a licence.
- Well then, the fares are fixed.
- They are, sir.
Hampton to Chelsea downstream, a penny halfpenny.
Chelsea to Hampton upstream, a penny halfpenny.
Whoever makes the regulations doesn' t row a boat.
No.
Threepence if you get me home for breakfast.
Thank you, sir.
A nice cup, sir.
Yes.
That' s worth money, sir.
Mind a way, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- Have you been here all night?
- Yes.
You said there was a post?
Yes.
I' il offer you a post, with a house, a servant and £50 a year.
What post?
At the new school.
A teacher!
Richard, no one' s going to give you a place at court.
Master Cromwell says he' il do something for me.
Cromwell?
Well, if you know Cromwell you don' t need my help.
Sir Thomas?
If only you knew how much, much rather, I had your help than his.
Not to a place at court.
Why not?
Look.
- What is it?
- It' s a bribe!
"I am the gift of Averil Machin."
And Averil Machin has a lawsuit in the Court of Requests.
Italian silver.
Take it.
No joke.
Thank you.
What will you do with it?
Sell it.
- And buy what?
- A decent gown!
But Richard, that' s a little bribe.
At court they offer you all sorts of things, home, manor houses, coats of arms.
A man should go where he won' t be tempted.
Why not be a teacher?
Perhaps a great one.
- lf I was, who would know it?
- You!
Your pupils.
Your friends.
God.
Not a bad public, that.
And a quiet life.
You say that.
You come from talking with the Cardinal.
Yes, talking with the Cardinal.
It' s eating your heart out, isn' t it?
The high affairs of state.
The divorce?
Boatman!
Sir?
- Take this gentleman to the New lnn!
- Right, sir.
Sir Thomas?
Thank you.
Be a teacher.
- Matthew.
- Lady Alice in bed?
- Yes, sir.
- Lady Margaret?
- No, sir.
The Master Roper' s here, sir.
At this hour?
Who let him in?
He' s a hard man to keep out, sir.
Will wants to marry me, Father.
Well, he can' t marry you.
Sir Thomas, I' m called to the Bar.
Oh, congratulations, Roper.
My family may not be at the palace, but in the city --
There' s nothing wrong with your family, Will.
There' s not much wrong with you.
Except you seem to need a clock.
I can buy a clock, sir.
Roper, the answer is no...... and will be no as long as you' re a heretic.
Now, that' s a word I don' t like, Sir Thomas!
It' s not a likeable word or thing.
The Church is heretical!
Dr. Luther' s proved that to my satisfaction!
Luther is an excommunicate!
From a heretic Church!
It' s a shop!
- Salvation by the shilling!
- Will, no!
- What I know, I' il say!
- You' ve no sense of the place!
He' s no sense of the time.
Now listen well.
Two years ago you were a passionate churchman.
Now you' re a passionate Lutheran.
We must just pray that when your head' s finished turning...... your face is to the front again.
- ls your horse here?
- No, sir, I walked.
Well, take a horse from the stables and get back home.
Go along.
May I come again?
Yes.
Soon.
Is that final, Father?
As long as he' s a heretic, Meg, that' s absolute.
What did Wolsey want?
Nice boy, young Will.
Terribly strong principles, though.
Clumsy, too.
- You' re very pensive.
- You' re very gay.
Was it the divorce?
To bed.
They' re a cantankerous lot, the Ropers.
Always swimming against the stream.
Old Roper was just the same --
You don' t want to talk about it.
No.
- I' m sorry you were awakened, chick.
- I wasn' t sleeping very deeply.
What did Wolsey want?
- Will Roper' s been.
- Will Roper?
Yes, he' s been here all night.
He wants to marry Meg.
- Why you don' t beat that girl l -- - No.
She' s full of education and it' s a delicate commodity.
Goodnight, Meg.
Goodnight.
Marry Meg.
A lawyer' s son.
Well, she' s a lawyer' s daughter.
Norfolk spoke of you for Chancellor of England before he left.
Well, he' s a dangerous friend then.
Wolsey' s chancellor, God help him.
But Norfolk said, if Wolsey fell, you --
If Wolsey fell, the splash would swamp a few small boats like ours.
No.
There' il be no new chancellors while Wolsey lives.
The Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England.
Have you any message for His Majesty?
If I had served God...... one half so well as I' ve served my King...... God would not have left me here, to die in this place.
Thank God you' re dying here.
The King would have you die in the Tower.
"I am straightly charged by the King himself...
"... here openly to declare how much all England...
"... is beholden to this man.
"And how worthy he is to have the highest room in the realm.
"And how dearly the King' s grace doth love and trust him...
"... not only for much good council...
"... deliberate council, but for better council yet...
"... that which is privy to the King' s person.
"This same Sir Thomas More...
"... here made before you all to be...
"... Lord Chancellor of the Realm."
Calm yourself, Matthew.
Fetch Lady Alice.
That' s very well.
My lady!
The King!
Now remember, the visit' s a surprise.
But he' il know we' re expecting him --
It' s a very great honour.
One friend calling on another.
What' s he really coming for?
To talk about the divorce.
He wants an answer.
- But he' s had his answer.
- He wants another.
Thomas!
Your Majesty does my house more honour than I fear my household will bear.
No ceremony Thomas, no ceremony!
A passing fancy.
I happened to be on the river.
Mud.
By heaven, what an evening.
Lady Alice, I fear we came upon you unexpectedly.
Yes, Your Grace.
Well, no, Your Grace.
Well, that is, we are ready to entertain --
This is my daughter Margaret, sire.
She' s not yet had the honour to meet Your Grace.
Why Margaret, they told me you were a scholar.
Answer, Margaret.
Among women, I pass for one, Your Grace.
Can you dance, too?
Not well, Your Grace.
Well, I dance superlatively!
That' s a dancer' s leg, Margaret!
Lady Alice, the river' s given me an appetite.
If Your Grace would share a very simple supper.
It would please me.
Lead them in.
Thomas and I will follow.
Matthew.
My lords and gentlemen!
Margaret?
Your Grace?
Do you like music?
Yes, Your Grace.
They' il play to you.
Now, listen to this.
Sit down.
Be seated.
No courtship, Thomas.
You' re my friend, are you not?
Your Majesty.
Thank God I have a friend for my chancellor.
Readier to befriend, I trust, than he was to be chancellor.
My own knowledge of my poor abilities --
I will judge of your abilities.
Thomas?
You know that Wolsey named you for chancellor?
Before he died, Wolsey named you, and Wolsey was no fool.
He was a statesman of incomparable ability, Your Grace.
Was he?
Was he so?
Then, why did he fail me?
It was villainy then.
Yes, villainy.
Secret opposition, secret.
But deliberate, wilful, meditated opposition.
Wanted to be pope to master me, Wolsey.
Because I' m simple and plain and deal with every man straightforwardly.
Wolsey was a proud man, Thomas.
Pride right through.
And he failed me.
Failed me in the one thing that matters, then as now.
But look.
Be seated.
What an evening.
A man could fight a lion.
Some men could, Your Grace.
Thomas...... touching this matter of my divorce.
Have you thought of it since we last spoke?
Of little else.
Then you see your way clear to me?
That you should put away Queen Catherine, sire?
Alas, as I think of it, I see so clearly...... that I cannot come with Your Grace, that my endeavour is...... not to think of it at all.
Then you haven' t thought enough!
Lilac.
We have them at Hampton.
Not so fine as this, though.
I' m in an excellent frame of mind.
Thomas, you must consider, I stand in peril of my soul.
It was no marriage.
I have lived in incest with my brother' s widow.
Leviticus:
"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother' s wife."
Chapter 18, verse 16.
Yes, Your Grace.
But Deuteronomy --
Deuteronomy is ambiguous!
Your Grace, I' m not fitted to meddle in these matters.
To me, it seems a matter for the Holy See --
Thomas, does a man need a pope to tell him where he' s sinned?
It was a sin.
God' s punished me.
I' ve no son.
Son after son she' s borne me.
All dead at birth, or dead within the month.
I never saw the hand of God so clear in anything.
It' s my bounden duty to put away the Queen.
And all the popes, back to Peter, shall not come between me and my duty!
Everyone else does.
Then, why does Your Grace need my poor support?
Because you' re honest.
And what is more to the purpose, you' re known to be honest.
Those like Norfolk follow me because I wear the crown.
Those like Cromwell follow because they' re jackals with sharp teeth...... and I' m their tiger.
A mass follows me...... because it follows anything that moves.
And then there' s you.
I am sick to think how much I must displease Your Grace.
No, Thomas, I respect your sincerity.
But respect...... man, that' s water in the desert.
How' d you like our music?
That air they played, it had a certain....
Well, tell me what you thought of it.
Could it have been Your Grace' s own?
Discovered!
Now I' il never know your true opinion, and that' s irksome.
Well, we artists, we love praise, yet we love truth better.
- Then I will tell my true opinion.
- Well?
To me it seemed delightful.
Thomas, I chose the right man for chancellor.
I should in fairness add that my taste in music is reputedly deplorable.
Your taste in music is excellent!
It exactly coincides with my own.
Music.
Music.
I' il live here in Chelsea and make music.
My house is at Your Grace' s disposal.
Touching this other business, mark you...... I' il have no opposition.
Your Grace.
No opposition, I say.
No opposition.
Be seated.
I' il leave you out of it but you are my chancellor.
I don' t take it kindly and I' il have no opposition!
I see how it will be.
The bishops will oppose me!
The full- fed princes of the Church!
All hypocrites!
Mind they do not take you in, Thomas!
Your Grace is unjust.
If I cannot serve Your Grace in this great matter of the Queen.
I have no queen!
Catherine' s not my wife!
No priest can make her so.
They that say she is my wife are not only liars, but traitors!
Yes, traitors!
That I will not brook now!
Treachery!
I will not brook.
It maddens me!
It is a deadly canker in the body politic, and I will have it out!
See?
You see how you' ve maddened me?
I hardly know myself.
If you could come with me, there' s no man I' d sooner raise...... yes, with my own hand.
Your Grace overwhelms me.
What' s that?
Eight o' clock, Your Grace.
Lift yourself up, man.
Have I not promised I' il leave you out of it?
Shall we eat?
If Your Grace pleases.
Eight o' clock, you said.
The tide will be turning.
I must go.
- I' m sorry, Your Grace.
If I don' t catch the tide I' il not get back to Richmond.
No, don' t come.
Lady Alice, I must go and catch the tide.
Affairs call me to court.
So we give you our thanks and we say goodnight!
What' s this?
- You crossed him!
- Somewhat.
- Why?
- I couldn' t find the other way.
You' re too nice altogether, Thomas.
- Woman, mind your house!
- I am minding my house!
God save Your Majesty!
God save Your Grace!
God save the King!
Lift!
Drop blades!
Are you coming my way, Rich?
No.
I think you should, you know.
I can' t tell you anything.
Well?
Thomas?
Stay friends with him.
Whatever may be done by smiling, you may rely on me to do.
Set your mind at rest.
This is not the stuff of which martyrs are made.
Good evening, sir, Lady Alice.
Will wants to talk to you, Father.
I told him it wouldn' t be convenient.
You were quite right.
You' re very free with my daughter' s hand, Roper.
Yes.
It' s of that I wish to speak.
Sir, you' ve had a disagreement with His Majesty.
- Have l?
- So Meg tells me.
I offer my congratulations.
If it' s true, is it a matter for congratulation?
Yes!
Sir, when last I asked you for your daughter' s hand...... you objected to my unorthodox opinions.
- I did.
Well, since then my views have somewhat modified.
Well, that' s good hearing, Will.
Mind you, I modify nothing concerning the various corruptions in the Church.
- Quite right.
- But an attack upon the Church herself...... no.
I see behind that an attack on God.
- Roper!
- The Devil' s work...... to be done by the Devil' s ministers!
For heaven' s sake, remember my office.
If you stand on your office --
No, I don' t stand on it, but there are certain things I may not hear.
Sir Thomas.
Richard?
I fell.
Lady Alice.
- Lady Margaret.
- Good evening.
Do you know William Roper, the younger?
By reputation, of course.
- Good evening, Master....
- Rich.
You' ve heard of me?
Yes.
In what connection?
I don' t know what you can have heard.
I sense that I' m not welcome here.
Have you done something to make you not welcome?
Cromwell is asking questions.
He' s always asking questions about you and your opinions.
Of whom?
Of him, for one.
That' s one of his sources.
Of course.
That' s one of my servants.
All right, Matthew.
Well, you look at me as though I were an enemy.
Why Richard, you' re shaking.
Help me.
How?
Employ me.
No.
- Employ me!
- No.
I would be faithful.
You couldn' t answer for yourself even so far as tonight.
Arrest him!
- For what?
- He' s dangerous!
He' s a spy!
- That man' s bad!
- There' s no law against that.
- God' s law!
- Then God can arrest him.
- While you talk, he' s gone!
Go he should, if he were the Devil, until he broke the law.
- Now you give the Devil benefit of law!
- Yes, what would you do?
Cut a road through the law to get after the Devil?
I' d cut down every law in England to do that.
And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned on you...... where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?
This country is planted with laws from coast to coast...... Man' s laws, not God' s, and if you cut them down...... and you' re just the man to do it...... do you really think you could stand upright in the wind that would blow then?
Yes.
I give the Devil benefit of law for my own safety' s sake.
- Master Rich?
- Yes.
In there, sir.
Rich?
Come in.
Taken you long enough to get here.
Have I kept you waiting?
Months.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Do you know the news?
- What news?
- Sir Thomas Paget is retiring.
And I succeed him.
Secretary to the Council?
You?
'Tis surprising, isn' t it?
I mean, one sees that' s logical.
Sit down, Rich.
No ceremony, no courtship...... as His Majesty would say.
You see how I trust you.
I' d never repeat or report a thing like that.
What kind of thing would you repeat or report?
Nothing said in friendship.
Do you believe that?
- Why, yes.
- No, seriously.
Well, yes.
Rich, seriously.
That would depend what I was offered.
Don' t say it just to please me.
It' s true.
It would depend what I was offered.
Well, there is another post vacant.
Collector of Revenues for York.
Is it in your gift?
Effectively.
What must I do for it?
I know a man who wants to change his woman.
Normally a matter of small importance, but in this case...... it' s our liege, Lord Henry, the eighth of that name.
Which is a quaint way of saying that if he wants to change his woman, he will.
And our job as administrators...... is to minimise the inconvenience which this is going to cause.
That' s our only job, Rich, to minimise the inconvenience of things.
A harmless occupation you would say, but no.
We administrators are not liked, Rich.
We are not popular.
I say "we" on the assumption you' il accept the post at York I' ve offered you.
Yes.
It' s a bad sign when people are depressed by their own good fortune.
- I' m not depressed.
- You look depressed.
I' ve lost my innocence.
Some time ago.
Have you only just noticed?
Your friend, our present Lord Chancellor, now there' s an innocent man.
The odd thing is, he is.
Yes, I say he is.
Unhappily...... his innocence is tangled up in this problem...... that you can' t change your woman without a divorce...... and you can' t get a divorce unless the Pope says so.
And from this meaningless circumstance, I foresee a certain measure of....
- lnconvenience?
- Just so.
This goblet he gave you, how much was it worth?
Come along, he gave you a silver goblet.
How much did you get for it?
Fifty shillings.
It was a gift, wasn' t it, from a litigant, a woman?
- Yes.
Chancery?
Don' t get drunk!
Which court was the litigant' s case?
Court of Requests.
That wasn' t too painful, was it?
- No.
- No.
And you' il find it easier, next time.
My Lord Archbishop, my lords...... Reverend Doctors of the Church.
The answer of our liege, Lord Henry...... to his trusty well- beloved subjects...... pontiffs in the Canterbury Convocation.
"His Majesty...
"... acknowledges your humble admission of many grievous errors..."... for which he accepts...
"... the manumission of £100, 000 in token.
"Mindful for the well- being of the realm and the quietness of his subjects...
"... His Majesty requires that you do now straightly renounce your pretended...
"... allegiance to the See of Rome.
"And admit the statute passed through parliament...
"... acknowledging the King' s good title...
"... Supreme Head of the Church in England."
Well, my lords, what' s your answer?
Yea or nay?
His Majesty accepts your resignation very sadly.
And in any matter concerning your honour and welfare he' il continue your good lord.
You will convey my humble gratitude.
- Help me with this.
- Not l.
- Alice?
- No.
Sun and moon, Master More, you' re taken for a wise man.
Is this wisdom?
To betray your ability...... abandon your station and forget your duty to your kith and kin?
Shall I, sir?
No, thank you, son Roper.
Margaret...... will you?
Yes.
If you want.
There' s my clever girl.
Well done, sir!
In my opinion, that thing' s a degradation.
I' il tell you my opinion of the King' s title, too --
Will, silence!
Remember, you have a wife now...... and may have children.
All right, Thomas, make me understand...... because I tell you, to me this looks like cowardice!
All right, I will.
This isn' t reformation, this is war against the Church.
Our King has declared war on the Pope because the Pope will not declare...
-... that our Queen is not his wife.
- And is she?
Is she?
Have I your word that what we say here is between us two?
Very well.
And if the King should command you to repeat what I may say?
I should keep my word to you.
Then what has become of your oath of obedience to the King?
You lay traps for me!
No, I show you the times.
For the Pope' s a prince, isn' t he?
He' s also the descendant of St. Peter, our only link with Christ.
So you believe.
And will you forfeit all you have...... which includes the respect of your country, for a belief?
Because what matters is that I believe it, or rather, no...... not that I believe it, but that I believe it.
- I trust I make myself obscure?
- Perfectly.
Why do you insult me with this lawyer' s chatter?
Because I' m afraid.
Man, you' re ill.
This is England.
My friends, you all know why I' ve called you here.
I have today resigned my office.
I am no longer a great man.
Sir, we want you to know that we' re all on your side.
My side?
What side is that?
Well, sir, we all know what you think.
And if you guess...... and babble it about, you do me no good service.
Since I am no more a great man, I no longer need a great household.
Nor can I afford one.
You will have to go.
However, I still number some great men among my friends...... and they still need great households.
No one will be turned away until we' ve found another place for him.
- We can' t find places for them all.
- Yes, we can.
Thank you.
That is all.
What about you, Matthew?
Will you stay?
Well, sir, that' s according.
There will be more work and less money.
Well then, I don' t see how I can then, sir.
After all, I' ve got my own --
Quite right, Matthew.
Why should you?
I shall miss you, Matthew.
I know that.
I shall miss you.
Isn' t that them all over!
What' s in me for him to miss?
No, Sir Thomas, I will not.
And that' s it.
And that' s all of it!
All right, so he' s down on his luck, I' m sorry.
I don' t mind saying that I' m sorry, bad luck.
If I had good luck to spare he could have some!
I wish we could have good luck all the time.
I wish we had wings!
But we don' t.
Well, there' s an end of you.
What' il you do now?
Sit by the fire...... and make goslings in the ash?
Not at all, Alice.
I expect I' il write a bit...... I' il write...... I' il read, I' il think.
I think I' il learn to fish.
I' il play with my grandchildren when son Roper' s done his duty.
- Alice, shall I teach you to read?
- No, by God!
Poor, silly man, you think they' il leave you here to think?
If we govern our tongues, they will!
I' ve made no statement.
I' ve resigned, that' s all.
The King is made, by act of parliament, Supreme Head of the Church in England.
This English Church will divorce him from the Queen, then marry him to Lady Anne.
But on any of these matters, have you heard me make a statement?
No.
If I' m to lose my rank and fall to housekeeping, I want to know the reason.
- So make a statement now.
- No.
Alice, it' s a point of law.
Accept it from me...... that in silence is my safety, under the law.
And my silence must be absolute, it must extend to you.
In short, you don' t trust me.
I' m the Lord Chief Justice, I' m Cromwell, I' m the keeper of the Tower.
I take your hand...... I clamp it on the Bible, on the blessed Cross and I say:
"Woman, has your husband made a statement on these matters?
"On peril of your soul remember, what is your answer?"
No.
And so it must remain.
Have you opened your mind to Meg?
Would I tell Meg what I won' t tell you?
Meg has your heart.
I know that well enough.
This is a dangerous matter then...... if you' ve not told Meg.
I don' t think so.
When they find I' m silent...... they' il want nothing better than to leave me silent.
You' il see.
But he' s silent, Master Secretary, why not leave him silent?
Your Grace, not being a man of letters...... you perhaps don' t realise the extent of his reputation.
This silence of his is bellowing up and down Europe!
In Europe he is claimed as the King' s enemy.
Crank he may be, traitor he is not.
Exactly.
And with a little pressure....
With a little pressure he can be got to say so.
That' s all we need.
A brief declaration of his loyalty...
-... to the present administration.
- I still say, let sleeping dogs lie.
The King does not agree with you.
What kind of pressure do you think you can bring to bear?
I have evidence that Sir Thomas, while he was a judge, accepted bribes.
What?
He was the only judge since Cato who didn' t accept bribes!
When was there a chancellor whose possessions, after three years...... totalled £100 and a gold chain?
It is, as you imply, common practice...... but a practice may be common and remain an offence.
This offence could send a man to the Tower.
Come here.
This woman' s name is Averil Machin.
She comes from Leicester.
- She entered a case -- - A property case it was.
Shut your mouth.
A property case in the Court of Requests in April, 1528.
And got a wicked false judgement!
And got an impeccably correct judgement from Sir Thomas.
- No, sir, it was not!
- Tell the gentleman...... about the gift you gave the judge.
I gave him a cup, sir.
A silver ltalian cup I bought in Leicester, for 100 shillings.
Did Sir Thomas accept this cup?
Yes, sir, he did.
He did accept it.
We can corroborate that.
You can go.
- To my way of thinking -- - Go!
- ls that your witness?
- No.
By an odd coincidence that cup later came into the hands of Master Rich here.
How?
- He gave it to me, Your Grace.
Why?
A gift.
Yes, you were a friend, weren' t you?
When did Thomas give you this thing?
I can' t exactly remember.
Do you "remember" what you did with it?
- I sold it.
- Where?
- A shop.
- Has the shop still got it?
No.
They' ve lost all track of it.
How convenient.
You doubt Master Rich' s word, Your Grace?
It had occurred to me.
This is the bill of sale.
That cow put her case into court in April, you said.
This is dated May.
In other words, the moment Thomas knew the cup was a bribe...... he dropped it into the nearest gutter.
The facts will bear that interpretation, I suppose.
This is a horse that won' t run, Master Secretary.
Just a trial gallop.
We' il find something better.
- I want no part of it.
- You have no choice.
What' s that you say?
The King particularly wishes you to be active in this matter of Sir Thomas.
He' s not told me that.
Indeed?
He told me.
Look here, Cromwell...... what' s the purpose of all this?
There you have me.
It' s a matter of conscience, I think.
The King wants Sir Thomas to bless his marriage.
If Sir Thomas appeared at the wedding now, it might save us all a lot of trouble.
He won' t attend the wedding.
If I were you, I' d try and persuade him.
I really would try, if I were you.
Cromwell, are you threatening me?
My dear Norfolk, this isn' t Spain.
This is England!
Thomas?
Thomas!
Lady Margaret?
Yes.
We' ve been cutting greens.
We use them for fuel.
I have a letter for your father, Lady Margaret.
From Hampton Court.
He' s to answer certain charges before Secretary Cromwell.
Good of you to come, Sir Thomas.
Master Rich will make a record of our conversation.
Good of you to tell me, Master Secretary.
I think you know one another.
Indeed yes, we' re old friends.
That' s a nice gown you have, Richard.
Sir Thomas, believe me.
No, that' s asking too much.
But let me tell you all the same.
You have no more sincere admirer than myself.
No, not yet, Rich, not yet.
If I might hear the charges.
- The charges?
- I understand there are certain charges.
Some ambiguities of behaviour I should like to clarify, hardly charges.
Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?
There are no charges.
Sir Thomas, Sir Thomas.
The King is not pleased with you.
I am grieved.
And yet, do you know that even now, if you could bring yourself...... to agree with the Church, universities, the Lords and the Commons...... there is no honour which His Majesty would be likely to deny you?
I am well acquainted with His Grace' s generosity.
Very well.
You have heard of the so- called "Holy Maid of Kent"...... who was executed for prophesying against the King?
- Yes, you met her.
Yet you did not warn His Majesty of her treason.
How was that?
She spoke no treason.
Our talk was not political.
But the woman was notorious.
Do you expect me to believe that?
- Happily, there were witnesses.
- You wrote a letter to her.
Yes.
I wrote, advising her to abstain from meddling in the affairs of state.
I have a copy of the letter.
Also witnessed.
- You have been cautious.
- I like to keep my affairs regular.
In the June of 1521, the King published a book.
A theological work.
It was called, A Defence of the Seven Sacraments.
For which he was named "Defender of the Faith" by His Holiness, the Pope.
By the Bishop of Rome, or do you insist on "pope"?
"Bishop of Rome" if you like.
It doesn' t alter his authority.
Thank you.
You come to the point very readily.
What is that authority?
For example, in the Church of England...... what exactly is the Bishop of Rome' s authority?
You will find it very ably set out and defended, Master Secretary...... in the King' s book.
In the book published under the King' s name, would be more accurate.
- You wrote this book.
- I wrote no part of it.
I don' t mean you actually held the pen.
I answered to my best ability, some points of common law...... which the King put to me, as I was bound to do.
Do you deny you instigated it?
It was from first to last the King' s own project.
The King says not.
The King knows the truth of it.
And whatever he may have said to you...... he will not give evidence to support this accusation.
Why not?
Because evidence is given on oath, and he will not perjure himself.
If you don' t know that, then you don' t yet know him.
Sir Thomas More.
Have you anything to say...... regarding the King' s marriage with Queen Anne?
I understood I was not to be asked that again.
Then you understood wrongly.
These charges --
They are terrors for children, Master Secretary, not for me!
Then know that the King commands me to charge you...... in his name, with great ingratitude!
And to tell you that there never was, nor could be, so villainous a servant...... nor so traitorous a subject, as yourself!
So...... I am brought here at last.
Brought?
You' ve brought yourself to where you stand now.
You may go.
For the present.
What will you do now?
Whatever' s necessary.
Boat!
Oh, come, come, it' s not as bad as all that!
Howard!
I can' t get home.
They won' t bring me a boat.
Do you blame them?
Is it as bad as that?
It' s every bit as bad as that!
Then it' s good of you to be seen with me.
I followed you.
Were you followed?
- You' re dangerous to know!
- Then don' t know me.
- I do know you.
- I mean as a friend.
I wish I wasn' t, but I am.
- What' s to be done then?
- Give in.
- I can' t give in, Howard.
Our friendship' s more mutable than that.
The one fixed point in the world of turning friendship...
-... is that Sir More won' t give in.
- To me it has to be, for that' s myself.
Affection goes as deep in me as you, I think.
But only God is love right through, Howard, and that' s my self.
And who are you?
And a lawyer' s son!
We' re supposed to be the proud ones, the arrogant ones, we' ve all given in.
Why must you stand out?
Goddammit man!
It' s disproportionate!
You' il break my heart.
No one is safe, Howard, and you have a son.
We' il end our friendship now.
- For friendship' s sake?
- Yes.
Daft!
Norfolk, you' re a fool!
You can' t place a quarrel, you haven' t the style.
You and your class have given in, as you rightly call it...... 'cause this country' s religion means nothing to you at all.
Well, that' s a foolish saying for a start!
The nobility of England --
The nobility of England would have snored through the Sermon on the Mount!
But you' il labour like scholars over a bulldog' s pedigree.
An artificial quarrel is not a quarrel.
We' ve had a quarrel since the day we met.
Our friendship was mere sloth.
You can be cruel when you want, but I' ve always known that.
What do you value in your bulldogs?
Gripping, is it not?
- Yes.
- It' s their nature?
- Yes.
- It' s why you breed them?
It' s so with men.
I will not give in, because I oppose it.
Not my pride, not my spleen, nor any other of my appetites, but I do, l.
Is there, in the midst of all this muscle, no sinew that serves no appetite...... of Norfolk' s, but is just Norfolk?
- Give that some exercise, my lord!
As you stand you' il go before your Maker ill conditioned!
Now steady.
And he' il think that, somewhere back along your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!
Cast in this very house on April 3, last year...... it is a matter very fit for the Commons, gathered here...... in parliament, to take in hand.
Or, in consequence of the decay of guilds...... the woolen cloth, now coming out of Yorkshire, Lincoln...... and the like, is not to blame and this....
I will defer the rest of my matter to later.
That the loyal Commons, here assembled, will speedily enact this bill, I doubt not.
For as much as it concerns the King' s new title and his marriage to Queen Anne.
Both matters pleasing to a loyal subject.
Mark, my Masters...... there is among us a brood of discreet traitors...... to which deceit the King can brook no longer.
And we, his loyal huntsmen, must now drive these subtle foxes from their covert.
Father?
Margaret!
I couldn' t get a boat.
What is it, Meg?
Father, there' s a new act going through parliament.
And by this act, they' re going to administer an oath...... about the marriage.
On what compulsion is the oath?
- High treason.
- But what is the wording?
Do the words matter?
We know what it means.
Tell me the words.
An oath is made of words.
It may be possible to take it.
Take it?
And if it can be taken, you must take it, too.
No!
Listen, Meg.
God made the angels to show him splendour.
As he made animals for innocence and plants for their simplicity.
But Man he made to serve him wittily, in the tangle of his mind.
If he suffers us to come to such a case that there is no escaping...... then we may stand to our tackle as best we can.
And yes, Meg, then we can clamour like champions, if we have the spittle for it.
But it' s God' s part, not our own, to bring ourselves to such a pass.
Our natural business lies in escaping.
If I can take this oath, I will.
I would, for my sake, you could take the oath.
I never took a man into the Tower less willingly.
Thank you, Master Governor.
Thank you.
Sir Thomas.
Sir Thomas.
Sir Thomas!
This is iniquitous.
- Where to this time?
- Richmond Palace.
Sit down.
This is the Seventh Commission to inquire into the case...... of Sir Thomas More, appointed by His Majesty' s Council.
Have you anything to say?
No.
- Seen this document before?
- Many times.
It is the Act of Succession.
These are the names of those who have sworn to it.
- I have, as you say, seen it before.
- Will you swear to it?
No.
Thomas, we must know --
We must know plainly whether you recognise the offspring of Queen Anne...... as heirs to the throne.
The King in parliament tells me that they are.
- Of course I recognise them.
- Will you swear to it?
- Yes.
- Then why won' t he swear to the act?
Because there is more than that in the act.
Just so.
Sir Thomas, it states in the preamble that the King' s former marriage...... to the Lady Catherine was unlawful...... she being his brother' s widow and the Pope having no authority to sanction it.
Is that what you deny?
Is that what you dispute?
Is that what you are not sure of?
You insult His Majesty and Council in the person of the Lord Archbishop!
I insult no one.
I will not tell you why I will not.
- Then your reasons must be treasonable!
- Not "must be," may be.
It' s a fair assumption!
The law requires more than an assumption, the law requires a fact.
Of course, I cannot judge your legal standing in the case...... but until I know the ground of your objections...... I can only guess your spiritual standing, too.
If you' re willing to guess that, it should be small matter to guess my objections.
Then you do have objections to the act?
Well, we know that, Cromwell!
No, my lord, you don' t.
You may suppose I have objections, all you know is that I will not swear to it...... for which you cannot lawfully harm me further.
But if you were right in supposing me to have objections, and right again...... in supposing my objections to be treasonable...... the law would let you cut my head off.
Oh, yes.
Well done, Sir Thomas.
I' ve been trying to make that clear to His Grace for some time.
Oh, confound all this!
I' m not a scholar.
I don' t know if the marriage was lawful or not...... but damn it, Thomas, look at these names.
Why can' t you do as I did, and come with us, for fellowship?
And when we die, and you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience...... and I am sent to hell for not doing mine, will you come with me, for fellowship?
So, those of us whose names are there, are damned, Sir Thomas?
I have no window to look into another man' s conscience.
I condemn no one.
- Then the matter is capable of question?
- Certainly.
But that you owe obedience to the King is not capable of question.
So weigh a doubt against a certainty and sign.
Some men think the earth is round, others think it flat.
It is a matter capable of question.
But if it is flat, will the King' s command make it round?
And if it is round, will the King' s command flatten it?
No, I will not sign.
Then you have more regard for your own doubt than the King' s command?
- For myself I have no doubt.
- No doubt of what?
No doubt that I will not take this oath.
But why I will not, you, Master Secretary, will not trick out of me.
I might get it out of you in other ways.
You threaten like a dockside bully.
How should I threaten?
Like a minister of state, with justice!
Justice is what you' re threatened with.
Then I am not threatened.
Gentlemen, can' t I go to bed?
The prisoner may retire as he requests.
- Unless you -- - I see no purpose in prolonging this.
Then, goodnight, Thomas.
May I have one or two more books?
Why, you have books?
Yes.
I didn' t know, you shouldn' t have.
May I see my family?
No.
Captain!
Master Secretary?
Have you ever heard the prisoner speak of the King' s divorce, supremacy...
-... or the King' s marriage?
- No, not a word.
If he does, you will repeat it to me.
Of course.
Rich.
Secretary?
Tomorrow morning, remove the prisoner' s books.
Is that necessary?
With regards to this case, the King is becoming impatient.
- Aye, with you.
- With all of us.
The King' s impatience will embrace a duke or two.
Master Secretary.
Sir Redvers Llewellyn has retired.
The Attorney General for Wales.
His post is vacant.
You said that I might approach you.
Not now, Rich.
He must submit.
He must!
Rack him.
No.
The King' s conscience will not permit it.
We have to find some other way.
Sir Thomas!
Father!
What?
Margaret?
Father!
For God' s sake, they haven' t put you in here?
- No, sir, a visit.
- A brief one, Sir Thomas.
Father.
- Good morning, husband.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Will.
Well, this is a hellish place!
Except it' s keeping me from you, my dears, it isn' t so bad.
It' s remarkably like any other place.
- Yes.
It' s too near the river.
Well, what is it?
Father, come out!
Swear to the act and come out!
Is this why they' ve let you come?
Yes.
Meg' s under oath to persuade you.
That was silly, Meg.
How do you plan to do that?
Father.
"God more regards the thoughts of the heart than the words of the mouth."
- Well, so you' ve always told me.
- Yes.
Then say the words of the oath and in your heart think otherwise.
What is an oath then, but words we say to God?
Listen, Meg.
When a man takes an oath, he' s holding his own self in his own hands...... Iike water.
And if he opens his fingers then, he needn' t hope to find himself again.
Some men aren' t capable of this, but I' d be loathed to think your father one of them.
- I have another argument.
- Oh, Meg.
In any state that was half good, you would be raised up high, not here...
-... for what you' ve done already.
- All right.
It' s not your fault the state' s three- quarters bad.
No.
If you elect to suffer for it, you elect to be a hero.
That' s very neat.
But look now.
If we lived in a state where virtue was profitable...... common sense would make us saintly.
But since we see that avarice, anger, pride and stupidity...... commonly profit far beyond charity, modesty, justice and thought...... perhaps we must stand fast a little...... even at the risk of being heroes.
But in reason!
Haven' t you done as much as God can reasonably want?
Well, finally it isn' t a matter of reason.
Finally, it' s a matter of love.
You' re content then to be shut up here with mice and rats...
-... when you might be home with us?
- Content?
If they' d open a crack that wide, I' d be through it like a bird and back to Chelsea.
I haven' t told you what the house is like without you.
Don' t, Meg.
- What we do in the evening without you.
- Meg, have done.
We don' t read because we' ve no candles.
We don' t talk because we wonder what they' re doing to you.
He doesn' t use the rack.
Two minutes to go, sir.
- I thought you' d like to know.
- Two minutes!
- Jailer!
- Sorry, sir.
Two minutes.
All of you must leave the country.
- And leave you?
- It makes no difference.
They won' t let me see you again.
You must all go on the same day, but not on the same boat.
- Different boats from different ports.
- After the trial, then.
There' il be no trial, they have no case.
Do this for me, I beseech you.
- Will?
- Yes, sir.
- Margaret?
- Yes.
Alice?
- Alice, I command you!
- Right.
This is splendid.
- I know who packed this.
- I packed it.
Yes.
You still make a superlative custard, Alice.
Do l?
That' s a nice dress you have on.
Nice colour anyway.
My God, you think little of me!
I know I' m a fool...... but I' m not such a fool as to be lamenting for my dresses...... or to relish complimenting on my custards.
I' m well rebuked.
- Alice -- - No!
I' m sick with fear when I think of the worst they may do to me.
But worse than that will be to go with you not understanding why I go.
I don' t.
If you can tell me that you understand, I might make a good death, if I have to.
- Your death' s no good to me.
- You must tell me that you understand.
I don' t!
I don' t believe this had to happen!
If you say that I don' t see how I' m to face it.
It' s the truth!
- You' re an honest woman.
- Much good may it do me.
I' il tell you what I' m afraid of...... that when you' ve gone, I shall hate you for it.
You mustn' t, Alice.
You mustn' t.
As for understanding, I understand you' re the best man I ever met or ever likely to.
And if you go, God knows why I suppose, though as God' s my witness...... God' s kept deadly quiet about it.
And if any one wants to know my opinion of the King and his Council...... he only has to ask for it!
Why, it' s a lion I married.
A lion.
A lion.
This is good.
It' s very good.
Sorry, Sir Thomas!
- Oh, for pity' s sake!
- Time' s up, sir.
- But one more minute!
- You don' t know what you' re asking.
- Come along, Miss.
- For heaven' s sake.
Now, don' t do that, sir.
Now, madam, don' t make trouble.
Come along, please, Lady Alice.
Take your muddy paws off me!
Filthy, stinking, gutter- fed, turnkey!
I' il see you suffer for this!
Goodbye.
You must understand my position, sir.
I' m a plain, simple man and I just want to keep out of trouble.
Dear Lord Jesus, my soul Saviour, clear my wits.
Dear Lady, Blessed Mother of God, comfort my wife and daughter...... and forgive me for them.
Sir Thomas More, though you have heinously offended the King' s majesty...... we hope that if you' il even now forethink and repent of obstinate opinion...... you may still taste his gracious pardon.
My lords, I thank you.
As for the matters you may charge me with...... I fear from my present weakness, that neither my wit...... nor my memory will serve...... to make sufficient answer.
I should be glad to sit down.
A chair for the prisoner.
Master Secretary Cromwell, have you the charge?
- I have, my lord.
- Then read the charge.
"That you did wilfully and maliciously deny and deprive...
"... our liege, Lord Henry, of his undoubted certain title...
"... Supreme Head of the Church in England."
But, I have never denied this title.
At Westminster Hall, at Lambeth, and again at Richmond...... you stubbornly refused the oath.
Was this no denial?
No, this was silence.
And for my silence, I am punished with imprisonment.
- Why have I been called again?
- On a charge of high treason, Sir Thomas.
For which the punishment is not imprisonment.
Death...... comes for us all, my lords.
Yes, even for kings he comes.
The death of kings is not in question, Sir Thomas.
Nor mine, I trust, until I' m proven guilty.
Your life lies in your own hands, Thomas, as it always has!
Then I' il keep a good grip on it.
So, Sir Thomas...... you stand on your silence?
I do.
But, gentlemen of the jury...... there are many kinds of silence.
Consider first the silence of a man when he is dead.
Suppose we go into the room where he is laid out and we listen.
What do we hear?
Silence.
What does it betoken, this silence?
Nothing.
This is silence pure and simple.
But let us take another case.
Suppose I were to take a dagger from my sleeve...... and make to kill the prisoner with it.
And my lordships there, instead of crying out for me to stop, maintain their silence.
That would betoken!
It would betoken a willingness that I should do it.
And under the law, they would be guilty with me.
So silence can, according to the circumstances...... speak.
Let us consider now the circumstances of the prisoner' s silence.
The oath was put to loyal subjects all over the country who all declared...... His Grace' s title to be just and good!
But when it came to the prisoner, he refused!
He calls this "silence."
Is there a man in this country...... who does not know Sir Thomas More' s opinion of this title?
Yet, how can this be?
Because this silence betokened...... nay, this silence was not silence at all, but most eloquent denial!
Not so.
Not so, Master Secretary.
The maxim of the law is, "Silence gives consent."
If, therefore, you wish to construe what my silence betokened...... you must construe that I consented, not that I denied.
Is that in fact what the world construes from it?
Do you pretend that is what you wish the world to construe from it?
The world must construe according to its wits.
This court must construe according to the law.
My lords, I wish to call Sir Richard Rich!
Richard Rich, come into court.
Richard Rich!
"I do swear the evidence I' il give before the court shall be the truth...
"... the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
"So help me God," sir.
"So help me God."
Now Rich, on May 12, you were at the Tower?
- I was.
- For what purpose?
I was sent to carry away the prisoner' s books.
- Did you talk with the prisoner?
- Yes.
Did you talk of the King' s supremacy of the Church?
Yes.
What did you say?
I said to him, "Supposing there were an act of parliament...
"... to say that I, Richard Rich, were to be king.
"Would not you, Master More, take me for king?"
"That I would," he said.
"For then you would be king."
Yes?
Then he said, "But I will put you a higher case.
"How, if there were an act of parliament, to say that God should not be God?"
- This is true and then you said -- - Silence!
Continue.
But then I said, "I will put you a middle case.
"Parliament has made our King Head of the Church.
"Why will you not accept him?"
Well?
And then he said, "Parliament had not the power to do it."
Repeat the prisoner' s words.
He said:
"Parliament had not the competence."
Or words to that effect.
He denied the title!
He did.
In good faith, Rich, I am sorrier for your perjury than my peril.
- Do you deny this?
- Yes!
You know if I were a man who heeded not the taking of an oath...... I need not be here.
Now, I will take an oath.
If what Master Rich has said is true...... I pray I may never see God in the face.
Which I would not say, were it otherwise, for anything on earth!
- That is not evidence.
- ls it probable....
Is it probable that after so long a silence on this...... the very point so urgently sought of me...... I should open my mind to such a man as that?
Sir Richard, do you wish to modify your testimony?
No, my lord.
Is there anything you wish to take away from it?
No, my lord.
Have you anything to add?
No, my lord.
- Have you, Sir Thomas?
- To what purpose?
I am a dead man.
You have your will of me.
Then the witness may withdraw.
There is one question I would like to ask the witness.
That' s a chain of office you' re wearing.
May I see it?
The Red Dragon.
What' s this?
Sir Richard is appointed Attorney General for Wales.
For Wales.
Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world.
But for Wales.
My lords!
I' ve done.
The jury will retire and consider the evidence.
Considering the evidence, it shouldn' t be necessary for them to retire.
Is it necessary?
Then is the prisoner guilty or not guilty?
Guilty, my lord!
Sir Thomas More, you have been found guilty of high treason.
- The sentence of the court -- - My lords!
When I was practising the law, the manner was to ask the prisoner...... before pronouncing sentence, if he had anything to say.
Have you anything to say?
Yes.
Since the court has determined to condemn me...... God knoweth how...... I will now discharge my mind...... concerning the indictment and the King' s title.
The indictment is grounded in an act of parliament...... which is directly repugnant...... to the law of God and His Holy Church.
The supreme government of which no temperable person...... may by any law presume to take upon him.
This was granted...... by the mouth...... of our Saviour, Christ Himself...... to St. Peter and the bishops of Rome whilst He lived...... and was personally present...... here on earth.
It is therefore insufficient in law...... to charge any Christian to obey it.
And more than this...... the immunity of the Church is promised both in Magna Carta...... and in the King' s own coronation oath.
Now, we plainly see you are malicious!
Not so.
I am the King' s true subject...... and I pray for him and all the realm.
I do none harm.
I say none harm.
I think none harm.
And if this be not enough to keep a man alive...... then in good faith, I long not to live.
Nevertheless...... it is not for the supremacy that you have sought my blood...... but because I would not bend to the marriage!
You have been found guilty of high treason.
The sentence of the court is that you be taken...... to the Tower of London...... until the day hence to the appointment...... for your execution!
I am commanded by the King to be brief...... and since I am the King' s obedient subject...... brief I will be.
I die His Majesty' s good servant...... but God' s first.
I forgive you, right readily.
Be not afraid of your office.
You send me to God.
You' re very sure of that, Sir Thomas?
He will not refuse one who is so blithe to go to him.
Thomas More' s head was stuck on Traitor' s Gate for a month.
Then his daughter, Margaret, removed it and kept it 'til her death.
Cromwell was beheaded for high treason five years after More.
The Archbishop was burned at the stake.
The Duke of Norfolk should have been executed for high treason...... but the King died of syphilis the night before.
Richard Rich became Chancellor of England...... and died in his bed.
It is my sad duty to inform you that Eva Perón, spiritual leader of the nation, entered immortality at 8: 25 this evening.
- You are not welcome here.
- He was the father of my children too.
They have a right to see him, to pay their last respects.
You are not his wife.
Your children are bastards.
Oh what a circus
Oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress
Called Eva Perón
We' ve all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all
Of the misery right
Oh what an exit
That' s how to go
When they' re ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried
Like Eva Perón
It' s quite a sunset
And good for the country ln a roundabout way
We' ve made the front page of all
The world' s papers today
But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?
She had her moments She had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the Casa Rosada
Crying, "Eva Perón"
But that' s all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We' re all gonna see, and how
She did nothing for years
You let down your people, Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That' s all they wanted
Not much to ask for
But in the end you
Could not deliver
Sing, you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven' t got long
Your queen is dead Your king is through
She' s not coming back to you
Show business kept us all alive
Since 1 7 October 1 945
But the star has gone The glamour' s worn thin
That' s a pretty bad state for a state to be in
Instead of government, we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna' s rage
Instead of help, we were given a crowd
She didn' t say much, but she said it loud
Don' t cry for me, Argentina
For I am ordinary
Unimportant
And undeserving
Of such attention
I think we all are
So share my glory
So share my coffin
It' s our funeral too
Senor Magaldi?
It' s seven o 'clock.
You' il be late.
Now, Eva Perón
Had every disadvantage
You need if you' re going to succeed
No money, no cash
No father, no bright lights
There was nowhere she' d been
At the age of 1 5
As this tango singer found out
Agustin Magaldi
Who has the distinction of being the first
Man to be of use
To Eva Duarte
On this night of 1 000 stars
Let me take you to heaven' s door
Where the music of love' s guitars
Plays forever more
In the glow of those twinkling lights
We shall love through eternity
On this night in a million nights
Fly away with me
I never dreamed that a kiss could be as sweet as this
Now I know that it can
I used to wander alone without a love of my own
I was a desperate man
But all my grief disappeared
And all the sorrow I' d feared wasn' t there any more
On that magical day When you first came my way, miamor
To think that a man as famous as you are
Could love a poor little nothing like me
I want to be a part of B. A. Buenos Aires, Big Apple
Just listen to that
They' re onto you, Magaldi
I' d get out while you can
It' s happened at last
I' m starting to get started
I' m moving out with my man
Now, Eva, don' t get carried away
Monotony passed, suburbia departed
Who could ever be fond of the back of beyond
Don' t hear words that I didn' t say
What' s that?
You desert the girl you love?
The girl I love?
What are you talking about?
She really brightened up your out of town engagement
She gave you all she had She wasn' t in your contract
You must be quite relieved
That no one' s told the papers
So far
I want to be a part of B. A. Buenos Aires, Big Apple
Would I have done
What I did
If I hadn' t thought
If I hadn' t known
We would stay together?
Seems to me there' s no point in resisting
She' s made up her mind, you' ve no choice
Why don' t you be the man who discovered her?
You' il never be remembered for your voice
The city can be paradise
For those who have the cash
The class and the connections
What you need to make a splash
The likes of you get swept up
In the morning with the trash
If you were rich or middle class...
Screw the middle classes
I will never accept them
My father' s other family were middle class
And we were kept out of sight
Hidden from view at his funeral
Do all your one night stands
Give you this trouble?
Eva, beware of the city
It' s hungry and cold
Can' t be controlled
It is mad
Those who are fools are swallowed up whole
And those who are not become
What they should not become
Changed, in short they go bad
Bad is good for me
I' m bored, so clean and so ignored
I' ve only been predictable, respectable
Birds fly out of here So why, oh why, oh why the hell can' t l?
I only want variety of society
I want to be a part of B. A. Buenos Aires, Big Apple
Five years from now I shall come back
And finally say You have your way
Come to town
But you' il look at me with a foreigner' s eyes
The magical city
A younger girl' s city
A fantasy long since put down
All you' ve done to me Was that a young girl' s fantasy?
I played your city games all right, didn' t l?
I already know what cooks
How the dirty city feels and looks
I tasted it last night, didn' t l?
Eva, beware your ambition
It' s hungry and cold
Can' t be controlled, will run wild
This in a man is danger enough
But you are a woman
Not even a woman
Not very much more than a child
And whatever you say I' il not steal you away
What' s new, Buenos Aires?
I' m new I want to say I' m just a little stuck on you
You' il be on me too
I get out here, Buenos Aires
Stand back
You oughta know What you' re gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality
Fill me up with your heat With your noise, with your dirt, overdo me
Let me dance to your beat Make it loud, let it hurt, run it through me
Don' t hold back You are certain to impress
Tell the driver this is where I' m staying
Just look at me Dressed up somewhere to go
We' il put on a show
Take me in at your flood, give me speed Give me lights, set me humming
Shoot me up with your blood Wine me up with your nights
Watch me coming
All I want is a whole lot of excess
Tell the singer this is where I' m playing
Stand back, Buenos Aires
Because you oughta know What you' re gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality
And
If ever I go to far
It' s because of the things you are
Beautiful town
I love you
And
If I need a moment' s rest
Give your lover the very best
Real eiderdown
And silence
You' re a tramp, you' re a treat You will shine to the death
You are shoddy
But you' re flesh, you are meat You shall have every breath in my body
Put me down for a lifetime of success
Give me credit, I' il find ways of paying
Rio de la Plata
Florida, Corrientes, Nueve de Julio
All I want to know
I don' t expect my love affairs
To last for long
Never fool myself
That my dreams will come true
Being used to trouble
I anticipate it
But all the same I hate it
Wouldn' t you?
So what happens now?
Another suitcase in another hall
Take your picture off another wall
- Where am I going to?
- You' il get by, you always have before
Time and time again
I' ve said that
I don' t care
That I' m immune to gloom
That I' m hard through and through
But every time it matters
All my words desert me
So anyone can hurt me
And they do
So what happens now?
Another suitcase in another hall
Take your picture off another wall
You' il get by you always have before
Where am I going to?
Call in three months time
And I' il be fine
I know
Well, maybe not that fine
But I' il survive anyhow
I won' t recall the names and places
Of each sad occasion
But that' s no consolation
Here and now
Where am I going to?
Don' t ask any more
Good night and thank you, whoever
She' s in every magazine Been photographed, seen
She is known
We don' t like to rush but your case has been packed
If she' s missed anything you could give her a ring
But she won' t always answer the phone
Oh but it' s sad when a love affair dies
But we have pretended enough
It' s best that we both stop fooling ourselves
Which means...!
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been and never will be a lover, male or female
Who hasn' t an eye on
In fact they rely on tricks they can try on their partner
They' re hoping their lover will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don' t blame them You' re the same
Good night and thank you, Emilio
You' ve completed your task
What more can we ask of you now?
Please sign the book on the way out the door
And that will be all lf she needs you, she' il call
But I don' t think that' s likely somehow
Oh but it' s sad when a love affair dies
But when we were hot we were hot
I know you' il look back on the good times we shared
Which means...!
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been and never will be a lover
Male or female
Who hasn' t an eye on ln fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They' re hoping their lover Will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don' t blame her You' re the same
There is no soap No soap like Zaz
No detergent, lotion or oil With such power
In the shower
It' s the mother and father
Of luxury lather
The talk of the bath The great ointment
One little frolic With new Zaz carbolic
You' re scented
You' il be sent
Good night and thank you, Senor Jabón
We are grateful
You found her a spot on the sound radio
We' il think of you every time she' s on the air
We' d love you to stay but you' d be in the way
So do up your trousers and go
Oh but it' s sad when a love affair dies
The decline into silence and doubt
Our passion was just too intense to survive
Which means...!
This is a club I should never have joined
Someone has made us look fools
Argentine men call the sexual shots
Someone has altered the rules
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes
Is all very well, but every girl knows
She needs a man she can monopolise
With fingers in dozens of different pies
In June of '43
There was a military coup
Behind it was a gang called
The G. O. U.
Who did not feel
The need to be elected
They had themselves a party at the point of a gun
They were slightly to the right of Attila the Hun
A bomb or two And very few objected
Just one shell
And governments fall like flies
Ka- pow, die They stumble and fall
Bye- bye Backs to the wall
Aim high We' re having a ball
The tank and bullet ruled As democracy died
The lady' s got potential She was setting her sights
On making it in movies with her name in lights
The greatest social climber since Cinderella
OK, she couldn' t act But she had the right friends
And we all know a career depends
On knowing the right fella
To be stellar
Just one shell And governments lose their nerve
That' s how we get The government we deserve
Now, the man behind the president calling the shots
Involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots
Was Colonel Juan Perón
Would- be dictator
He began in the army out in ltaly so
Saw Mussolini' s rise from the very front row
And reckoned he' d do likewise
Sooner or later
Just one blast And the tear gas falls like rain
They haven' t a chance
The terrorists advance
But one guy doesn' t dirty his hands
Perón was biding time out
In the slow lane
Suddenly an earthquake hit
The town of San Juan
They stumble and fall
Keep away from the wall
But one guy
Was having a ball
The tragedy a golden chance for Perón
He organised a concert With incredible flair
In aid of all the victims Such a grand affair
Politicians, actors Stars of every flavour
It was January 22, 1 944
A night to remember, that' s for sure
For that' s the night That Perón first met Eva
On this night
On this night
On this night of 1 000 stars
Let me take you to heaven' s door
Where the music of love' s guitars
Plays for evermore
Your act hasn' t changed much
Neither has yours
I stand here as a servant of the people
As we come together for a marvellous cause
You' ve shown by your presence
Your deeds and applause
What the people can do
True power is yours Not the government' s
Unless it represents
The people
One always picks
The easy fight
One praises fools
One smothers light
One shifts
From left to right
Politics
The art of the possible
I' ve heard so much about you
I' m amazed
- For I' m only an actress - For I' m only a soldier
- Nothing to shout about - One of the thousands
- Only a girl on the air - Defending the country he loves
But when you act
The things you do affect us all
But when you act
You take us away from the squalor of the real world
- Are you here on your own?
So am I
What a fortunate coincidence
Maybe you' re my reward
For my efforts here tonight
It seems crazy
But you must believe
There' s nothing calculated
Nothing planned
Please forgive me
If I seem naive
I would never want to force your hand
But please understand I' d be good for you
I don' t always rush in like this 20 seconds after saying hello
Telling strangers I' m too good to miss
If I' m wrong I hope you' il tell me so
But you really should know I' d be good for you
I' d be surprisingly good for you
I won' t go on if I' m boring you
But do you understand my point of view
Do you like what you hear What you see
And would you be
Good for me too?
I' m not talking of a hurried night
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it gets too light
That' s not the reason that I caught your eye
Which has to imply I' d be good for you
Please go on.
You enthral me
I can understand you perfectly
And I like what I hear, what I see
And knowing me
I would be good for you too
I' m not talking
Of a hurried night
A frantic tumble
Then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it gets too light
That' s not the reason That I caught your eye
Which has to imply I' d be good for you
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been, and never will be a lover
Male or female
Who hasn' t an eye on ln fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They' re hoping their lover Will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them Don' t blame them, you' re the same
Hello and goodbye
I' ve just unemployed you
You can go back to school
You' ve had a good run
I' m sure he enjoyed you
Don' t act sad or surprised Let' s be friends, civilised
Come on, little one Don' t sit there like a dummy
The day you knew would arrive is here
You' il survive
So move, funny face
I like your conversation
You' ve a catchy turn of phrase
You' re obviously going through Some adolescent phase
So what happens now?
Where am I going to?
You' il get by, you always have before
Don' t ask any more
At the watering- holes
Of the well- to- do
I detect a resistance to
Precisely
Our heroine' s style
We' re glad you noticed
The shooting sticks
Of the upper class
Give her an inch...
Aren' t supporting a single ass
That would rise for the girl... She' il take a mile
Such a shame she wandered
Into our enclosure
How unfortunate this person
Has forced us to be blunt
No, we wouldn' t mind
Seeing her at Harrods
But behind the jewellery counter
Not in front
Could there be
In our fighting corps
A lack of enthusiasm for
Perón' s latest flame?
You said it, brother
Should you wish
To cause great distress
In the tidiest officer' s mess
Just mention her name
That isn' t funny
Perón is a fool, breaking every taboo
Installing the girl in the army H. Q.
And she' s an actress, the last straw
Her only good parts Are between her thighs
She should stare at the ceiling Not reach for the skies
Or she could be his last whore
The evidence suggests
She has other interests
If it' s her that' s using him
He' s exceptionally dim
Dangerous Jade
We have allowed ourselves to slip
We have completely lost our grip
We have declined to an all- time low
Tarts have become the set to know
I' m only a radio star with just one weekly show
But speaking as one of the people
I want you to know
We are tired of
The decline of Argentina
With no sign of
A government able to give us the things we deserve
It' s no crime for officers to do as they please
As long as they' re discreet and keep clear of disease
We ignore, we disregard
But once they allow a bit on the side
To move to the centre where she' s not qualified
We are forced to mark his card
She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she' s not paid
To be loud, but to be laid
Slut
Dangerous Jade
This has really been your year Miss Duarte
Tell us where you go from here Miss Duarte
Which are the roles that you yearn to play?
Whom did you sleep... dine with yesterday?
Acting is limiting The lines not mine
That' s no help to the Argentine
Can we assume then that you' il quit?
Is this because of your involvement
With Colonel Perón?
She won' t be kept happy by her nights on the tiles
She says it' s his body
But she' s after his files
So get back onto the street
She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she' s not paid
To be loud, but to be laid
The evidence suggests
She has other interests
If it' s her that' s using him
He' s exceptionally dim
Things have reached a pretty pass
When someone pretty lower class
Graceless and vulgar, uninspired
Can be accepted and admired
Dice are rolling The knives are out
Would- be presidents are all around
I don' t say they mean harm But they' d each give an arm
To see us six feet underground
It doesn' t matter
What those morons say
Our nation' s leaders are a feeble crew
There' s only 20 of them anyway
What is 20 next to millions who
Are looking to you?
All you have to do is sit and wait
Keeping out of everybody' s way
You' il be handed power
On a plate
When the ones who matter Have their say
And with chaos installed
You can reluctantly agree
To be called
There again we could be foolish
Not to quit while we' re ahead
For distance lends enchantment
And that is why
All exiles
Are distinguished
More important, they' re not dead
I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay
This is crazy defeatist talk
Why commit political suicide
There' s no risk There' s no call for any action at all
When you have unions on your side
A new Argentina
The chains of the masses untied
The voice of the people
Cannot be denied
There is only one man who can lead any workers' regime
He lives for your problems He shares your ideals and your dream
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not
How could he love me?
A new Argentina
The workers' battle song
The voice of the people
Rings out loud and long
Now, I am a worker
I' ve suffered the way that you do
I' ve been unemployed And I' ve starved, and I' ve hated it too
But I found my salvation in Perón
May the nation let him save them
As he saved me
A new age about to begin
We face the world together
And no dissent within
There again we could be foolish
Not to quit while we' re ahead
I can see us many miles away, inactive
Sipping cocktails on a terrace
Taking breakfast in bed
Sleeping easy, doing nothing
It' s attractive
Don' t think I don' t think like you I often get those nightmares too
They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it' s very difficult to keep Momentum, if it' s you that you are following
Don' t close doors Keep an escape clause
Because we might lose
The Big Apple
But would I have done what I did
If I hadn' t thought
If I hadn' t known
We would take the country?
Perón has resigned from the army and this we avow
The descamisados are those he is marching with now
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not
How could he love me?
Release him.
How annoying that they have to fight elections
For their cause
The inconvenience
Having to get a majority
If normal methods of persuasion
Fail to win them applause
There are other ways of establishing authority
Your newly elected president Juan Perón
We are all workers now
Fighting against our common enemies
Poverty, social injustice...
Foreign domination of our industries
Reaching for our common goals
Our independence, our dignity
Our pride
Let the world know
That our great nation is awakening
And that its heart beats in the humble bodies
Of Juan Perón
And his wife
The first lady of Argentina
Eva
Duarte
De Perón
It won' t be easy
You' il think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I' ve done
You won' t believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she' s dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen
I had to change
Couldn' t stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around
Trying everything new
But nothing
Impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don' t cry for me, Argentina
The truth is
I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don' t keep your distance
And as for fortune
And as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They' re not
The solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you
And hope you love me
Have I said too much?
There' s nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is
Look at me to know
That every word is true
Just listen to that
The voice of Argentina
We are adored, we are loved
Statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants
We shall see, little man
I am only a simple woman who lives to serve Perón in his noble crusade to rescue his people.
I was once as you are now, and I promise you this, we will take the riches from the oligarchs.
Only for you, for all of you.
And one day you too will inherit these treasures!
When they fire those cannons, when crowds sing of glory, it is not just for Perón but for all of us!
For all of us!
Things have reached a pretty pass
When someone pretty lower class
Can be respected and admired
But our privileged class is dead
Look who they are calling for now
High flying, adored
So young, the instant queen
A rich, beautiful thing
Of all the talents a cross between
A fantasy of the bedroom
And a saint
You were just a back street girl
Hustling and fighting
Scratching and biting
High flying, adored
Did you believe in your wildest moments
All this would be yours
That you' d become the lady of them all?
Were there stars in your eyes
When you crawled in at night
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical?
Don' t look down
It' s a long, long way to fall
What happens now?
Where do you go from here?
For someone on top of the world
The view is not exactly clear
A shame you did it all
At 26
There are no mysteries now
Nothing can thrill you No one fulfil you
High flying, adored
I hope you come to terms with boredom
So famous, so easily
So soon
Is not the wisest thing to be
You won' t care if they love you
It' s been done before
You' il despair
If they hate you
You' il be drained of all energy
All the young who' ve made it
Would agree
High flying, adored
That' s good to hear, but unimportant
My story' s quite usual
Local girl
Makes good, weds famous man
I was slap in the right place
At the perfect time
Filled a gap, I was lucky
But one thing I' il say for me
No one else can fill it like I can
There again I' ve more to do
Than simply get the message through I haven' t started
Let' s get this show on the road
Let' s make it obvious
Perón is off and rolling
Eyes, hair
Mouth, figure
Dress, voice
Style, movement
Hands, magic
Rings, glamour
Face, diamonds Excitement, image
I came from the people
They need to adore me
So Christian Dior me
From my head to my toes
I need to be dazzling
I want to be rainbow high
They must have excitement
And so must I
I' m their product, it' s vital to sell me
So Machiavell me Make an Argentine rose
I need to be thrilling
I want to be rainbow high
They need their escape, and so do I
All my descamisados expect me To outshine the enemy
I won' t disappoint them
I' m their saviour
That' s what they call me
So Lauren Bacall me Anything goes
To make me fantastic
I have to be rainbow high
In magical colours
You' re not decorating a girl
For a night on the town
And I' m not a second- rate queen
Getting kicks with a crown
Next stop will be Europe
The Rainbow' s gonna tour
Look out, mighty Europe
Because you ought to know What you' re gonna get in me
People of Europe
I send you the Rainbow of Argentina
Spain has fallen to the charms of Evita
She can do what she likes It doesn' t matter much
She' s our lady of the New World With a golden touch
She filled a bull ring 45, 000 seater
But if you' re prettier than General Franco
That' s not hard
Franco' s reign in Spain
Should see out the '40s
So you' ve just acquired an ally
Who looks as secure in his job as you
But more important
Current political thought is
Your wife' s a phenomenal asset
Your trump card
Let' s hear it for the Rainbow tour
It' s been an incredible success
We weren' t quite sure We had a few doubts
Will Evita win through?
But the answer is yes
There you are, I told you so
Makes no difference where she goes
The whole world over, just the same
Just listen to them call her name
And who would underestimate
The actress now?
Now, I don' t like to spoil a wonderful story
But the news from Rome lsn' t quite as good
She hasn' t gone down Like they thought she would
Italy' s unconvinced
By Argentine glory
They equate Perón with Mussolini
Can' t think why
Did you hear that?
They called me a whore
They actually called me a whore
But Senora Perón
It' s an easy mistake
I' m still called an admiral
Yet I gave up the sea long ago
More bad news from Rome
She met with the Pope
She only got a rosary
A kindly word
I wouldn' t say the Holy Father Gave her the bird
But Papal decorations
Never a hope
She still looked the part at St. Peter' s Caught the eye
Eva started well, no question, in France
Shining like a sun Through the post- war haze
A beautiful reminder of the carefree days
She nearly captured the French
She sure had the chance
But she suddenly seemed to lose interest
She looked tired
The Rainbow started to fade
I don' t think she' il make it to England now
It wasn' t on the schedule anyhow
You' d better get out the flags
And fix a parade
Some kind of coming home in triumph is required
Let' s hear it for the Rainbow Tour
It' s been an incredible success
We weren' t quite sure
We had a few doubts
Would Evita win through?
And the answer is yes
And no
Thus all fairy stories end
Only an actress would pretend
Affairs of state are her latest play
Eight shows a week, two matinees
My, how the world begins to turn
When will the chorus girl ever learn?
The chorus girl
Hasn' t learned the lines you' d like to hear
She won' t go scrambling
Over the backs of the poor
To be accepted
By making donations
Just large enough
To the correct charity
She won' t be president
Of your wonderful societies of philanthropy
Even if you asked her to be
As you should have asked her to be
The actress hasn' t learned the lines
You' d like to hear
She won' t join your clubs
She won' t dance in your halls
She won' t help the hungry once a month
At your tombolas
She' il simply take control
As you disappear
Forgive my intrusion
But fine as those sentiments sound
Little has changed for us peasants
Down here on the ground
I hate to sound childish, ungrateful
I don' t like to moan
But do you now represent
Anyone' s cause but your own?
Everything done
Will be justified by my foundation
And the money kept rolling in
From every side
Eva' s pretty hands reached out And they reached wide
Now you may feel it should have been
A voluntary cause
But that' s not the point, my friends
When the money keeps rolling in You don' t ask how
Think of all the people Guaranteed a good time now
Opened up the doors
Never been a fund Like the Foundation Eva Perón
Rolling, rolling, rolling
Would you like to try a college education?
Own your landlord' s house Take the family on vacation?
Eva and her blessed fund
Can make your dreams come true
Here' s all you have to do, my friends
Write your name and your dream On a card or a pad or a ticket
Throw it high in the air And should our lady pick it
She will change your way of life
For a week or even two
Name me anyone who cares as much as Eva Perón
The money kept rolling out in all directions
To the poor, to the weak To the destitute of all complexions
Now, cynics claim A little of the cash has gone astray
But that' s not the point, my friends
When the money keeps rolling out You don' t keep books
You can tell you' ve done well By the happy, grateful looks
Accountants only slow things down
Figures get in the way
Never been a lady Loved as much as Eva Perón
Perón is everything.
He' s the soul, the nerve, the hope and the reality of the Argentine people.
We all know that there is only one man in our movement with his own source of light, we all feed from his light, and that is Perón.
And now she wants to be
Vice- president
That was the over- the- top Unacceptable suggestion
We didn' t approve But we couldn' t prevent
The games of the wife of the president
But to give her intentions
Encouragement
She' s out of her depth
And out of the question
But on the other hand
She' s all they have
She' s a diamond in their
Dull, grey lives
And that' s the hardest kind of stone
It usually survives
And when you think about it...
Can you recall
The last time they loved
Anyone at all?
She' s not a bauble
You can brush aside
She' s been out doing
What we just talked about
Example: gave us back our businesses
Got the English out
And when you think about it...
Well, why not do
One or two of the things
We promised to?
But on the other hand
She' s slowing down
She' s lost a little of that magic drive
But I would not advise those critics present
To derive
Any satisfaction from her fading star
She' s the one who' s kept us
Where we are
She' s the one who' s kept you
Where you are
Turn a blind eye, Evita Turn a blind eye
Please, gentle Eva
Will you bless a little child?
For I love you
Tell Heaven I' m doing my best
I' m praying for you
Even though you' re already blessed
Will you look upon me as your own?
Make me special
Be my angel, be my everything
Wonderful, perfect and true
And I' il try to be
Exactly like you
Turn a blind eye, Evita
Why try to govern a country
When you can become a saint?
Tell me before I waltz out of your life
Before turning my back on the past
Forgive my impertinent behaviour
But how long do you think This pantomime can last?
Tell me before I ride off in the sunset
There' s one thing I never got clear
How can you claim you' re our saviour
When those who oppose you Are stepped on or cut up
Or simply disappear?
Tell me before you get onto your bus
Before joining the forgotten brigade
How can one person like me, say
Alter the time- honoured way the game is played?
Tell me before you get onto your high horse
Just what you expect me to do
I don' t care what the bourgeoisie say
I' m not in business for them
But to give all my descamisados
A magical moment or two
There is evil
Ever around, fundamental
System of government quite incidental
So what are my chances of honest advances?
I' d say low
Better to win by admitting my sin
Than to lose with a halo
Tell me before I seek worthier pastures
And thereby restore self- esteem
How can you be so short- sighted
To look never further than this week or next week
To have no impossible dream?
Allow me to help you slink off to the sidelines
I' il mark your adieu with three cheers
If I said I' d take on The world' s greatest problems
From war to pollution No hope of solution
Even if I lived for 1 00 years
There is evil
Ever around, fundamental
System of government quite incidental
So go, if you' re able
To somewhere unstable
And stay there
Whip up your hate ln some tottering state
But not here, dear ls that clear, dear?
Oh what I' d give for 1 00 years
But the physical interferes
Every day more
Oh my creator
What is the good
Of the strongest heart
In a body that' s falling apart?
A serious flaw
I hope you know that
Your little body' s slowly breaking down
You' re losing speed
You' re losing strength Not style
That goes on flourishing forever
But your eyes, your smile
Do not have the sparkle of your fantastic past
If you climb one more mountain
It could be your last
I' m not that ill
Bad moments come
But they go
Some days are fine
Some a little bit harder
But that doesn' t mean
We should give up our dream
Have you ever seen me defeated?
Don' t you forget
What I' ve been through, and yet...
I' m still standing
Eva, you' re dying
So what happens now?
Where am I going to?
Don' t ask any more
Where do we go from here?
This isn' t where we intended to be
We had it all
You believed in me
I believed in you
Certainties disappear
What do we do For our dream to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive As we used to do?
Deep in my heart I' m concealing
Things that I' m longing to say
Scared to confess what I' m feeling
Frightened you' il slip away
You must love me
Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance And I' il let you see how
Nothing has changed
The actress
Hasn' t learned the lines
You' d like to hear
She' s sad for her country
Sad to be defeated
By her own weak body
I want to tell the people
Of Argentina
I' ve decided
I should decline
All the honours and titles
You' ve pressed me to take
For I' m contented
Let me simply go on
As the woman who brings her people
To the heart of Perón
The truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder
For you to see me
I' m Argentina
And always will be
Have I said too much?
There' s nothing more I can think of
To say to you
But all you have to do
Is look at me to know
That every word
Is true
She had her moments
She had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the Casa Rosada They' re crying, "Eva Perón"
But that' s all gone now
The choice was mine
And mine completely
I could have any prize
That I desired
I could burn
With the splendour
Of the brightest fire
Or else, or else I could choose time
Remember?
I was very young then
And a year
Was forever
And a day
So what use could 50 60 70 be?
I saw the lights
And I was on my way
And how I lived
How they shone
But how soon
The lights were gone
The choice was yours
And no one else' s
You can cry for a body
In despair
Hang your head
Because she is no longer there
To shine, or dazzle, or betray
How she lived
How she shone
But how soon
The lights were gone
Eyes, hair
Face, image
All must be preserved
Still life displayed forever
No less
Than she deserved

Previously on "Lost"...
It was them.
The Others...
Have you seen other people on this island?
I hear them.
Out there, in the jungle.
They whisper.
They' ve attacked us, sabotaged us, abducted us!
We' re not the only people on this island, and we all know it!
Maybe it' s time we stopped blaming us and started worrying about them!
They came the first night, took three of us, then they came back and took nine more.
They' re smart, and they' re animals, and they could be anywhere at anytime, and if you think that one gun and one bullet is gonna stop them... think again.
Shannon!
This is not your island.
This is our island, and the only reason you' re livin 'on it is' cause we let you live on it.
They' re getting closer!
Move it!
Burn those!
Shred faster!
Hurry up!
Sayid!
Take these files!
Burn them!
Keep shredding you cowards!
We leave when I say!
Stop again, and I' il kill you myself!
I' m your commanding, officer, and you will do --
Stop!
Get down!
Get the hell down!
Get down, get down!
You, no, no, no, drop your gun on the ground now!
Freeze!
On the ground now!
Stop burning that stuff!
Get the hell down!
Who' s in charge here?
I said who' s in charge?!
Somebody better tell him to stop, or god help me, he' s dead!
They don' t understand, sergeant.
They understand.
Listen up!
I' il fire on three!
One, two...
Stop shredding or they' il kill you!
You!
You in charge?
- No, I am not.
- Who is?
There is no commanding officer here.
He left two hours ago for Hillah.
Your English is good, Abdul, but you' re lying, and that ain' t so good.
That' s him, sergeant.
Let' s go, hombre.
Son, we don' t want to be here any more than you do, and your pal Saddam had to go marchin 'into Kuwait, so here we all are.
Buccelli here says you speak English.
You ever do any translatin '?
Formally?
No.
Hell, fact you know what "formally" means, well, we' re good.
Apache helicopter went down in this sector two days ago.
Our sources tell us the pilot was captured.
It' s very important that we get this pilot back.
We know he was taken to the local Republican Guard intelligence commander -- a man named Tariq.
Do you know him?
Yes, he was our commanding officer.
You know where he is?
When the bombing started, he fled to Hillah.
Hillah, huh?
Yes, that is right.
Welcome to Hillah.
Where' s Jack?
Why?
There.
See?
Go back.
I' il deal with this.
What?
Go back, Ana Lucia, and don' t tell anyone what you saw.
What are you doing here, Danielle?
Looking for you.
Where are we going?
You said you were looking for me.
What was your plan -- to hide in the woods, hoping I would pass you by?
I was going to wait until dark, then find you at your tent.
Why?
We need to keep moving.
Not until you tell me where we' re moving to.
Trust me.
The last time we met, you arrive to warn us the others were coming, which they weren' t.
In fact, it was a diversion to kidnap Claire' s baby, so pardon me for not trusting you.
This place I' m taking you to -- there is something that will help you, something important.
So trust.
Take this.
If I' m lying, it' s yours to use.
How much further?
Not far.
Ask him where he took the pilot.
They want to know where the pilot is.
Tell him his mother is a goat.
He says he does not know.
Look, we know for a fact he interrogated the pilot day before yesterday -- hell, probably in this room.
Tell him we get our man back safe and sound, he goes free.
They will let you go if you tell them where the pilot is.
You are a disgrace.
You' re an Iraqi soldier!
Steal his gun and kill them all.
Right there on his belt.
You can get a few of them before you are killed.
What' s he saying?
He says he does not know.
I was born, but I wasn' t born yesterday, son.
Now you don' t help me out here, someone else will take over, and that someone, he won' t play nice at all.
I am sorry.
He does not know.
Okay.
You had your chance.
G uards?
Lock him back up.
This is unbelievable.
Hey.
Hey, you hear that thing?
You hear that frog?
The frog?
You want to help me find it?
What, we ain' t friends anymore?
What do you got there, Rerun?
Nothin '.
Yeah, well, you got a spot of "nothin '" on your chin, there.
"Dharma initiative ranch dressing."
You know, you' re supposed to refrigerate that after you open it.
Well, actually on the back it says it' il keep at room temperature for up to 7 years.
Well, well, looky who' s got a secret stash.
Please, dude, you can' t tell.
What, that you stole food from the group?
Now why would I want to do that?
Come on, man, please?
Son of a bitch.
Dude, it' s just a tree frog.
- Have you seen it?
- Yeah.
Tell you what -- you help me find that thing, you can keep right on ranch dippin '.
We got a deal?
How much further?
- Danielle?
- We' re here.
And where exactly is "here"?
What is that for, Danielle?
Help me!
Hey!
Over here!
Wait.
- Help!
- Sayid, listen to me.
Hey!
Aah!
Over here!
Please!
Help me!
Help me!
Don' t believe a word he says.
Hey!
He' s one of them.
I have no idea what she' s talking about.
She' s crazy.
How long has he been up there?
Since last night.
Please, just cut me down.
My name is Henry Gale.
I' m from Minnesota.
- Please.
- He' s lying.
I' m going to cut him down.
Don' t.
Thank you.
You' re making a serious mistake.
It' s okay, it' s okay.
You' re all right.
You' re all right.
Hold on.
Take it easy.
Oh, no.
Wait!
Danielle, don' t!
You could have killed him.
If I wanted to kill him, I would have killed him.
You shot this man with no provocation.
He is one of them!
Tie him up.
You should take him to your doctor.
He' s no good to you dead.
And then what?
You talk to him, Sayid.
As I recall, that is what you do.
But know this -- he will lie.
For a long time, he will lie.
I want to talk to you about your buddy Tariq.
All right, look, I get it.
You' re a man who values loyalty.
Even doing a little translating for us, you feel like you' re doing the wrong thing.
I get that, and I respect it.
This is what Tariq was doing before he took over command of your intelligence unit.
He was the head of a chemical warfare battalion in the north, personally supervised the use of Sarin gas on this village.
You recognize it, don' t you?
You had relatives in that village, didn' t you, Sayid?
So you know what Sarin gas does.
No discrimination.
The entire marketplace.
Innocent women... children.
Enough...
Please.
Loyalty is a virtue, but unquestioning loyalty --
I don' t think that' s you.
Why should I believe you?
How do you think we knew you had relatives in that village?
We liberated your personnel file and Tariq' s.
All we want is our pilot back, so we can send him home to his family.
Tariq will never talk to you.
That' s why you' re gonna have to make him talk to you.
John.
John, wake up.
What?
Come out here.
Minnesota, huh?
That' s the question, isn' t it?
Where am I?
- Who are you?
- Henry.
Henry Gale.
Aah!
My back!
We' re going to take it out, but first I want you to relax.
How did you get to this island?
Four months ago, we crashed, my wife and I.
- Crashed in what?
- A balloon.
We were trying to cross the Pacific.
Your wife -- where is she?
She died.
She got... she got sick three weeks ago.
We were staying in a cave off the beach.
My shoulder.
At least untie my arms!
What the hell is going on here?
Rousseau trapped him in the jungle.
- She believe she' s an other.
- An "other" what?
- You shot him with an arrow?
- Do I have a bow?
Hey, hey, you with me?
What, you were just gonna let him bleed to death?
I was trying to get honest answers while he was able to give them... and his wound is far from life- threatening.
We should let Jack treat him first, then we' il get our answers.
Jack... do not untie him.
This is how people get killed in scary movies.
If it were a scary movie, I' d be with a hot chick, not you, Barbar.
- It' s Babar.
- How about you shut up, Hammo, or your ranch disorder' s gonna be the new lead item on the coconut internet.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Tell everyone the fat guy' s been hiding ranch dressing, the fat guy who likes to eat.
Yeah, I' m fat.
Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat.
You think I don' t know that?
At least people like me.
You know what?
Find the damn frog by yourself.
Hurley, wait!
Wait!
Hey, Hurley!
Look, man, I' m sorry, all right?
This frog is killin 'me.
You gotta help me out...
Please.
So what do you think?
What do you think, John?
I think he' s pretty convincing.
Yes, he is.
The real problem is there' s no way we can be sure he' s telling the truth.
That is not necessarily true.
Does Jack have the combination to the armory?
For now, he does.
How long would it take for you to change it?
looking for someone to punish...
Why would I need to punish anyone?
I want to find out who he is.
I want the truth.
And I think we both know that Jack will have issues with what must be done in order to get it.
So how long, John, to change the combination?
A couple minutes, tops.
Then I suggest you get started.
Did he say anything while you were treat --
No, he didn' t.
He was in shock.
We can' t just leave him layin 'here, Jack.
People will see him and create a panic.
Yeah?
Well, where do you think we should put him?
I say we put him in the armory.
It' s secure.
Better to err on the side of safety, Jack, at least until we can be sure.
Okay.
For now.
All right, pull that cot in here.
He shouldn' t be on his back.
Good idea.
Sayid!
Hey, what the hell you doin '?
What needs to be done.
They' re letting speak to me alone now?
You need to tell me where the helicopter pilot is.
This is their new bluff?
That you' re going to torture me?
They think you will do this?
Sayid, you are a loyal soldier.
The son of a great hero.
Do not disgrace your father!
You wouldn' t dare harm me!
You will follow my orders as your commanding officer!
Take that bag.
Put it over your head and tape it up.
Kill yourself, now!
That' s an order.
Do it and die with what little honor you have left.
You would have me take my own life... the information means nothing to you!
The pilot was executed two days ago.
He is buried in a field 4 kilometers from here.
I can take you there.
Damn it.
Sayid, open the door!
- Sayid, answer me!
- Jack.
Why isn' t this combination working, John?
Did you change it?
Yeah.
Why would you do that?
You' re raising an army.
What?
And why you didn' t ask me to help, well, that' s your business, but there' s only one reason to raise an army, Jack, and that' s because we' re at war.
And like it or not, whatever Sayid has to do behind that door, that' s a part of it, too.
What if he' s telling the truth, John?
What if he' s not?
Get up.
What' s happening?
Here, let me help you.
You said you' ve been here for four months.
What?
You said you came to this island four months ago, yes?
Where am I?
Please answer my question.
Yeah -- yes, we landed four months ago, maybe more.
Who are you?
And you were in a cave for all that time?
Off the beach... on the north shore of the island.
How far from this beach to where you were captured?
I don' t know.
- How many days' walk?
- Two -- two days.
Why did you stay on the beach for so long?
Why wouldn' t we?
We wanted to be there for flyovers.
We had an emergency beacon -- a transmitter.
- What kind of transmitter?
- An A. D. F. beacon.
We wanted to make sure we' d be spotted.
Look, whatever you think I am, I' m not.
Please -- please just... tell me your name.
You wife -- what is her maiden name?
Murphy.
- Where did you meet her?
- University of Minnesota.
How did she die?
She got sick.
She got sick?
It started as a fever.
After two days, she was delirious... then she died.
I don' t know why you' re asking me all these questions.
I don' t know why you' re treating me this way... why I have to explain to you who I am when you don' t tell me who you are.
I was 23 years old when the americans came to my country.
I was a good man.
I was something different.
For the next six years,
I did things I wish I could erase from my memory, things which I never thought myself to be capable of... but I did come to learn this -- there is a part of me which was always capable.
You want to know who I am?
My name is Sayid Jarrah... and I am a torturer.
Where is it?
There it is.
Gotcha.
Dude, nice catch.
Well, I' il be damned.
All that noise from this tiny critter.
Kind of reminds me of a turtle I once had.
His name was Stewart.
He ran off when I was 10.
Well, that' s what mom said.
I kinda think she threw him out.
Well, you' re a happy little fella, ain' t ya?
I have an idea.
Why don' t I take him far from here, two beaches away?
Tree frog.
That way, he won' t keep you up anymore, and everyone' s happy.
Yeah, that' s one idea.
Here' s another.
Dude.
I hear with a little ranch, they taste just like chicken.
Give you a hand?
- Jack, I know this -- - Shut up.
Where are the pliers?
Tell me about this balloon.
What?
This balloon that brought you here with your wife -- tell me about it.
What do you want to know?
Everything.
She' s 140 feet high, 60 feet wide... and when she' s up in the air, 550, 000 cubic feet of helium and 100, 000 of hot air keep her up.
And if you could look down on her, you' d see a big, yellow smiley face on top.
Why would you travelin that way?
Because I was rich, because... it was my dream...
and Jennifer thought it would be neat.
You were rich.
I guess I' m thinking of things in the past tense now.
How' s that for optimism?
What did you do to become so rich?
- I sold my company.
- What kind of company?
- Mining.
- What did you mine?
We mined nonmetallic minerals.
I know, everyone wanted to talk to me at cocktail parties.
Give me your hands.
Give me your hands!
Where is she buried?
- What?
- Listen to me.
You said you buried your wife.
Tell me where.
- What are you gonna -- - Wwhere?!
In the jungle!
By the balloon, in the jungle.
How deep?
How deep did you dig the grave?
I don' t...
How deep?
How many shovelfuls of earth?
Did you use your hands?
How long did it take you?!
- I don' t remember!
- You would remember!
You would remember how deep!
You would remember every shovelful, every moment!
You would remember what it felt like to place her body inside.
You would remember if you buried the woman you loved.
You would remember, if it were true!
Did you... did you lose someone?
Did you lose someone here on the island?
Did you lose someone, too?
What happened to her?
It was an accident.
It was an accident.
The woman responsible thought she was someone else, someone coming to hurt her.
Someone like you!
Just -- just -- this is all a mistake.
Slow down here, okay?
Hurting me isn' t gonna bring her back.
You know what I lost!
Tell me the truth!
Tell me who you are!
No!
No!
No!
Help!
Stop!
Tell me the truth!
Tell me who you are!
Sayid!
Sayid!
Jack.
- Open it.
Open it now.
- Jack, this has to happen.
Open that damn door, you understand me?!
You open it now!
No.
Now!
What do you want me to say?!
Just -- please...
I want you to tell me the truth!
Open the door.
- Let go of me, Jack.
- Or what?
You want to pushthe button?
Open the door.
It' s under a minute now, John.
You better think fast.
- You wouldn' t.
- What?
I wouldn' t what?
If we don' t... you would risk everyone' s lives?
You talked me into pushing that button once, John, but it' s yours now.
You' re the onewho won' t risk it, you.
Me?
I don' t think anything' s gonna happen when we get down to zero.
Jack...
You want to see what' s gonna happen?
Let' s just see what' s gonna happen.
Who are you?!
Who are you?!
Okay, okay, okay, right, 15, left --
You think I' m stupid?
You open it!
- He' s lying!
- Not like this!
I' il tell you whatever you want!
He' s lying!
He' s lying!
That' s enough!
What the hell was that?
He is one of them.
Yeah?
Did he tell you that?
- No.
- Then how do you know?
Because I know.
He is one of them.
I think that' s what Rousseau thought about you once, Sayid.
If I' m not mistaken, she strapped you down, she shocked you, all because she thought you were one of them.
- He is.
- What?
He is one of them.
To Rousseau, we' re all "others."
I guess it' s all relative, huh?
You got a wife?
Kids?
I' il take him.
It' s over.
We' re pulling out, not going to Baghdad.
So your man Saddam gets to stay in power, which means you, in all likelihood, will remain in his employ.
Guess you' re lucky to have a new skill set you can use.
What you made me do, no human being should ever have to do to another.
One of these days... there will be something you need to know.
And now... you know how to get it.
I will never do that again.
Yeah.
Good luck to you, Sayid.
Bus fare back to Ramadi.
Let' s move out.
There is a man down in the hatch... a stranger captured by Rousseau.
I beat him.
I beat him badly.
Why are you telling me this, Sayid?
Jack asked me how I knew -- knew for sure that this man was lying, how I knew for sure that he was one of them, one of the others.
I know because I feel no guilt for what I did to him.
But there is no way I can ever explain that to Jack or even Locke... because both of them have forgotten.
Forgotten?
What?
That you were strung up by your neck and left for dead, that Claire was taken and kept for days, during which God only knows what happened to her, that these people, these "others", are merciless... and can take any one of us whenever they choose.
So tell me, Charlie.
Have you forgotten?

Manhattan lsland derives its name from its earliest inhabitants...... the Manhattan lndians.
They were a peaceful tribe, setting traps, fishing, hunting.
There was a custom among them:
Every July, when the heat became unbearable...... they would send their wives and children away.
Up the river to the highlands...... or, if they could afford it, to the seashore.
The husbands remained behind to attend to business:
Setting traps, fishing and hunting.
Our story has nothing whatsoever to do with lndians.
lt plays 500 years later.
Portland, Rockland, Plymouth and Bar Harbor.
Departing at 6: 30....
We brought up the subject to show how nothing has changed.
Setting traps, fishing and hunting.
We want you to meet a typical Manhattan husband.
This is Mr. Richard Sherman, his wife, Helen, and son, Ricky.
Ricky, what are you doing?
He' s an interplanetary spy.
I blasted him into dust.
Cut it out.
You' re going to Maine, not to Mars.
Goodbye, Helen.
- Goodbye, Richard.
- Why can' t Daddy come up with us?
- Daddy has to stay and make money.
I' il be fine.
- How will I get my allowance?
- I' il mail it to you.
You promised to eat properly and not smoke.
And you promised not to drink.
- I' il call you tonight at 10.
- Goodbye, Helen.
Goodbye, Ricky.
Let me kiss you.
- Take that thing off.
- He' s shutting off my oxygen!
Come on, we' il miss the train.
Helen, Ricky, the paddle!
You forgot the paddle!
- Ticket, mister?
- My son forgot the paddle.
Sorry, only those holding tickets admitted through the gates.
Oh, no, not me.
And I' m not gonna smoke either.
Look at them.
The train isn' t even out of the station.
Gotta get back to the office.
Man, is this hot!
A few more facts about Mr. Sherman:
They publish those pocket editions, two bits in any drugstore.
Old Mr. Brady is the boss, but Mr. Sherman is the key man.
He keeps the whole operation together.
ln the 25- cent book business, you can sell anything.
Even the old, dreary classics.
The trick is to soup up the title...... and get an interesting cover.
lt' s all a question of imagination...... and Mr. Sherman has a lot of imagination.
That' il be all, Miss Morris.
Not me.
And I' m not gonna smoke either.
Some husbands run wild because their wives are away.
Do anything they want.
Like Charlie Lederer.
Annie was gone two days...... when Charlie got himself tattooed.
Green dragon on his chest, butterfly on the shoulders.
Oh, no, work, work --
I' il work till 6, then have dinner at the saloon --
No!
No saloon, no drinking like Dr. Summers said.
I know, I' il try that vegetarian restaurant.
Health food, that' s the stuff.
The human body is a very delicate machine.
You can' t run it on martinis and goulash.
Especially in this hot weather.
- Miss, may I have the check, please?
- Yes, sir.
We had the special, the soybean hamburger...... with French- fried soybeans.
Soybean sherbet and peppermint tea.
I had a cocktail to start.
Yes, we had the sauerkraut juice on the rocks.
You' il be proud to know that the meal was only 260 calories.
I am proud.
That' il be $1. 27.
- Keep the change.
- We don' t permit tipping.
I can put it in our nudist camp fund.
- You do that.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
We must bring the message to the people.
To unmask our suffocating bodies and let them breathe again.
Without clothes there' d be no sickness and no war.
Can you imagine two armies on the battlefield...... no uniforms, completely nude?
No way of telling friend from foe, all brothers together.
Just a moment, sir.
You forgot your paddle.
Thank you.
I like this house.
Why does Helen want to move into one of those...... buildings out of Riot in Cellblock 11?
So much nicer here.
Just three apartments.
Ours, Kaufmans upstairs...... and two guys on the top, interior decorators or something.
It' s peaceful with everybody gone.
Sure is peaceful.
No Howdy Doody.
No Captain Video.
No smell of cooking.
No "What happened at the office?"
That' s what happened.
What can happen at the office?
It sure is peaceful.
"Use the opener, Richard."
"Carbonated water, citric acid, corn syrup...... artificial raspberry flavoring...... vegetable colors and preservative."
Why is this stuff better for you...... than a little scotch and a twist of lemon?
I' d really like to know.
Helen' s gonna call at 10.
I guess I better do a little reading.
I brought Dr. Brubaker' s manuscript home with me --
Ricky!
Okay, where is it?
Where is the other one?
I know it' s lurking here somewhere to get me.
Where is Captain Video' s other roller skate?
Now, who' s that?
- Yes, what is it?
- I' m sorry to bother you.
I forgot my key, so I had to ring your bell.
It' s perfectly all right.
Anything else I can do for you?
Would you mind pressing it again?
My fan' s caught in the door.
Oh, of course.
- Thanks.
- Do you live in our building?
ln the Kaufmans' apartment.
They' re in Europe.
I know you' il be happy here.
It' s a very quiet building.
No dogs, no children, just two interior decorators.
And you, and of course, me.
- You all right?
- Oh, sure, fine.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Well, now.
Maybe I should have asked her in for a drink.
After all, we' re one big family here.
Oh, no, no.
I' ve got to get to work on the Brubaker book.
I' m gonna talk to him about it tomorrow, so I better.
Of Man and the Unconscious, by Dr. Ludwig Brubaker.
Some title.
We' il have to soup this one up, that' s for sure.
Ten o' clock.
Helen' s not gonna call till 10: 00.
I hope this thing keeps me awake till 10: 00.
Chapter three:
"The Repressed Urge in the Middle- Aged Male.
lts Roots and lts Consequences. "
Helen has a lot of nerve calling me at 10: 00.
It shows a definite lack of trust.
What does she think I' m gonna do?
Get drunk?
Or tattooed?
Big, green dragon.
I bet she thinks I' il have girls up here.
That' s terrible.
I' ve never done anything like that.
Don' t think I couldn' t have either.
Because I could have, plenty.
Plenty.
Don' t laugh, Helen.
I happen to be very attractive to women.
You' re attractive to me, but I' m used to you.
This isn' t a thing one likes to tell his wife...... but women have been throwing themselves at me for years.
That' s right, beautiful ones, plenty of them.
- Acres and acres of them.
- Name one.
It' s hard just offhand, but there have been plenty of them.
You asked for it.
Take my secretary, for instance.
To you, she' s just Miss Morris, a piece of office furniture.
Ten fingers to type my letters.
Well, let me tell you.
- Did you type this letter?
- Yes, Mr. Sherman.
There are six errors in the first paragraph.
What is the matter with you?
- What' s the matter with you?
- I' il tell you what' s the matter.
I have been since the day I came here.
Deeply, madly, desperately, all- consumingly.
And to you I' m nothing, just a piece of furniture.
Ten fingers to type your letters with.
Mr. Sherman, take a look at me.
I' m a woman, do you hear?
With flesh and blood and nerves and feelings!
I want you....
That will be all, Miss Morris.
You remember that torn shirt, Helen?
Now you know how it happened.
What an imagination!
You don' t realize this about women and me:
I walk into a room and they sense it.
I arouse something in them, I bother them.
It' s a kind of animal thing I' ve got.
It' s quite extraordinary.
The only extraordinary thing is your imagination.
Last winter when I had my appendix out...... do you remember the nurse?
That sweet, little old lady with the gray hair?
That was the day nurse.
You never saw the night nurse, a certain Miss Finch.
Poor Miss Finch.
She fought it as long as she could.
- But then one night....
- Richard!
Miss Finch, please, not again tonight.
We have so little time.
Soon they' il take out your stitches and I' il have lost you forever.
Please, Miss Finch.
There is such a thing as ethics.
Remember, you are a registered nurse.
Ethics?
Once I was young.
Once I had ideals.
And then you happened.
Miss Finch, for five nights now you' ve been taking my pulse.
Have you never noticed this simple band of gold?
You' ve bothered me since they wheeled you into the operating room.
There' s this animal thing about you.
Please, Miss Finch, my adhesions.
Let' s crash out of here.
Let' s steal an ambulance.
You' re not fit to wear that uniform.
You' re rotten to the core.
Beat me till your arms ache.
I' il only come crawling back for more.
You' re forcing me to take measures...... to protect you from yourself.
No, no!
Put me down!
Put me down!
The moth and the flame, that' s what it was.
I hope I didn' t singe her wings too badly.
You read too many books and see too many movies.
For instance, take Elaine.
Your best friend, your bridesmaid.
Let me tell you about that weekend in Westport last summer.
You were playing canasta, suspecting nothing.
Walk!
We went swimming, moonlight swimming.
It bothers me.
It' s bothered me since the first time I saw you.
And it' il bother me always, from here to eternity.
You must fight it, Elaine.
Remember, I belong to another.
Richard!
This can never be.
I have a devoted, trusting wife at home.
And a freckle- faced little space cadet.
Richard!
So, Helen, in light of the circumstances...... l resent your calling to check up on me.
Don' t worry about me.
Although I have tremendous personal magnetism...... l also have strength of character.
And tremendous imagination.
You' ve begun to imagine it Cinemascope, with stereophonic sound.
Well...... back to work.
Chapter three:
"The Repressed Urge in the Middle- Aged Male. lts Roots and lts Consequences."
Helen is worried.
I just know she is.
She plays it cool, but she can' t fool me.
Why else would she call in the middle of the night?
She' s 31.
One day she' il wake up and find her looks are gone.
No wonder she' s worried.
I don' t look different than I did when I was 28.
It' s not my fault, it' s just a simple biological fact.
Women age quicker than men.
I won' t look different when I' m 60.
I have that kind of a face.
Everybody' il think she' s my mother.
Hello, Mother?
Oh, Helen!
I wasn' t expecting you to call till 10.
Everything all right?
Everything' s fine here.
Seems pretty empty without you, though.
Just sitting out on the terrace...... drinking, getting fractured on raspberry soda.
Oh, he did?
He hasn' t done that for a long time.
It' s the excitement.
That' s nice.
Who did you meet on the train?
Tom MacKenzie?
What' s he doing up there?
My advice is to avoid Tom like the plague.
I don' t want him carrying Ricky' s kayak.
lf anybody carries Ricky' s kayak, it' s gonna be you.
Cool?
It' s steaming here, like an oven.
Yeah, I' m pretty tired myself.
Good night, darling.
Chapter three:
"The Repressed Urge in the Middle- Aged Male.
lts Roots and lts Consequences. "
Maybe a twist of lemon would help this, or a shot of Worcestershire.
Hey, what' s the big idea?!
You wanna kill somebody?
- What' s the matter?
- This great cast- iron pot...... practically killed me.
Oh, it' s you.
Well, hello again.
What happened?
Oh, the tomato plant fell over!
It sure did.
- I' m terribly sorry.
- It' s nothing.
Look at that poor chair!
I hope it' s not some priceless antique.
- It' s just early Sears, Roebuck.
- lf there' s anything I can do....
Do what?
There' s nothing to worry about.
Now don' t touch it.
Good night.
Wait a minute.
- Yes?
I' il tell you one thing you could do.
lf you' re not doing anything else more important.
Would you have a drink with me?
- Thanks, I' d love it.
- You would?
Sure, it' d be fun.
Let me just go and put something on.
I get dressed in the kitchen.
When it' s hot like this, I keep my undies in the icebox.
- ln the icebox?
- See you in a minute.
ln the icebox!
I really need it, Dr. Murphy.
Honest I do.
Don' t worry, Dr. Murphy.
Just one, that' s all.
All those lovely injurious tars and resins.
And now a small concession from Dr. Summers?
Doctor, let' s be reasonable.
Can' t fly on one wing.
Okay, I' il put some soda in it.
"Do you want to come in for a drink?"
"I' d love it."
Just like that.
A beautiful girl too.
Must be a model or actress.
Atmosphere.
I need a little atmosphere.
Tomato plant.
Fan caught in the door.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
The first night Helen leaves, I' m bringing dames in here.
Take it easy.
There' s nothing wrong with asking a neighbor down for a drink.
I hope she doesn' t get the wrong idea.
lf this dame thinks she' s in for a big time, she' s in for a surprise.
One drink and out!
I' m a happily married man.
Maybe a little soft music.
She' s probably getting all fixed up.
She' il probably wear some ice- cold evening dress.
Let' s see.
Debussy, Ravel.
Stravinsky.
Stravinsky' d only scare her.
Here' s the baby, Rachmaninoff.
Give her the full treatment.
Come in like gangbusters.
Good old Rachmaninoff.
Never misses.
I' m so glad.
- Rachmaninoff.
- The Second Piano Concerto.
- It isn' t fair.
- Not fair?
Why?
- Every time I hear it, I go to pieces.
- Oh?
May I sit next to you?
Please do.
It shakes me, it quakes me.
It makes me goose- pimply all over.
I don' t know where I am, or who I am, or what I' m doing.
Don' t stop, don' t stop.
Don' t ever stop.
- Why did you stop?
- You know why I stopped.
- Why?
- Because.
Because now I' m going to kiss you...... very quickly and very hard.
One moment, my dear.
You came.
Yeah, I came for the rugs.
The rugs?
What is it you want?
I promised Mrs. Sherman.
Mr. Kruhulik --
- It' s on account of the moths.
- Forget the rugs.
Your wife is gonna find them full of big, gaping holes.
The janitor.
Pick them up tomorrow while I' m at the office.
I' m taking the missus and the kids to the train.
- They' re going to the country.
- All right, in the afternoon then.
I' m going to the barber in the afternoon.
I' m gonna take a shave, haircut, manicure, the whole works.
Come tomorrow evening, just not now.
Tomorrow evening?
Do you know the maid from 531 Park?
You must' ve seen her walking down the street with her fat poodle.
What?
Come now, we' re both summer bachelors.
Don' t let' s be naive.
Good night, Mr. Kruhulik!
Big, fat poodle!
He' s got four kids.
It' s disgraceful.
It' s late.
Where is she?
This is ridiculous.
She could' ve been here, had her drink and gone home already.
lce, we' il need ice.
Coming!
Coming, coming!
Hi!
It' s me.
Don' t you remember?
The tomato from upstairs.
Of course, the tomato.
Come in, please.
Honestly, I don' t know how it happened.
I was watering the plants.
I promised the Kaufmans I would.
I was using the cocktail shaker.
It' s the only thing I found.
A little silver one.
Then there was this terrible crash.
You could' ve been killed.
It' s probably criminal negligence.
You could' ve sued somebody.
Me, probably.
You' d have been dead.
Your lawyers could have.
Case dismissed.
What would you like to drink?
Anything.
You have a nice place here.
- You live here alone?
All alone.
- It' s a roller skate.
Mine, you know.
- Yours?
It' s adjustable.
What would you like to drink?
- You do drink?
- Sure, I drink like a fish.
- Do you have gin?
- Of course.
You mean straight gin?
No, gin and soda, I guess.
- Gin and soda?
How do you drink gin?
There' s gin and tonic, and gin and vermouth, that' s a martini.
I' il have a glass of that.
A big, tall one.
Big, tall martini.
This is a nicer apartment than the Kaufmans'.
For instance, the Kaufmans have no stairs.
- Hey, where do they lead to?
- No place.
No place?
That' s elegant.
You see, this used to be a duplex.
The landlord made two apartments out of it by boarding up your floor.
Oh, yes, I remember that patch in the floor.
I dropped my cuticle pusher down the crack.
Cuticle pusher.
Yeah.
Well, here you are.
Big, tall martini.
- Thanks.
- You' re welcome.
Very good.
Maybe it needs a bit more sugar.
I' d strongly advise against putting sugar in a martini.
- You would?
Why?
- Well....
Take my word for it.
No sugar in a martini.
Back home they put sugar in martinis.
Where?
- Denver, Colorado.
Hey, you' ve got air conditioning!
Put it on.
- Sure!
I got air conditioning in every room.
Don' t the Kaufmans?
No, it' s just terrible up there.
That' s why I bought the electric fan.
This feels just elegant.
I' m just not made for the heat.
It' s my first summer in New York, and it' s killing me.
Yesterday, I tried to sleep in the bathtub.
Just lying up to my neck in cold water.
Good idea.
But the faucet kept dripping.
It was keeping me awake.
I pushed my big toe up the faucet.
They call that American know- how.
Then my toe got stuck and I couldn' t get it out again.
You couldn' t?
I was able to call the plumber.
You called him?
He was very nice, even though it was Sunday.
He rushed right over.
Everything come out okay?
But it was embarrassing.
- I can see how it might' ve been.
Honestly, I almost died.
There I was with a strange plumber...... and no polish on my toenails.
- You got a cigarette around?
- A cigarette?
Sure.
Coming up.
- Here you are.
- Are you afraid of burglars?
I' m just trying not to smoke.
The theory is:
lf you don' t see them, you don' t think about them.
It' s only a theory.
All you do is spend half your life dragging ladders back and forth.
It' s just ridiculous.
At the club we had this girl who only smoked cigars.
She only did it to make herself look older.
- What club was that?
- This club I lived at.
I hated it.
You had to be in by 1 a. m.
Now I can stay out all night.
I was glad when they practically asked me to leave.
- Why did they ask you to leave?
- It was so silly.
I posed for a picture in U. S. Camera and they got all upset.
What was wrong with the picture?
I was -- It was one of these artistic pictures.
On the beach, with driftwood.
- It got honorable mention.
- ln U. S. Camera?
It was called "Textures."
You' d see three different kinds.
The driftwood, the sand and me.
I got $25 an hour.
- It took hours and hours.
- Very interesting line of work.
Now I' m on TV every other week.
- The Dazzledent Toothpaste Hour.
- You' re an actress?
I do the commercial part.
They put gray makeup on my teeth...... to show ordinary toothpaste.
Then they wipe it off to show how Dazzledent works.
I sit like this for about 14 seconds...... and I get to speak lines too.
"I had onions at lunch, I had garlic dressing at dinner.
I stay kissing- sweet...... the new Dazzledent way. "
- You do that beautifully.
- Thank you.
People don' t realize, but when I show my teeth on TV...... l appear before more people...... than Sarah Bernhardt ever did.
Something to think about.
It certainly is.
Wish I were old enough to have seen her.
Was she magnificent?
I wouldn' t know.
I' m not that old myself.
I guess you' re not really.
I will be in August.
At the moment I' m 38.
I was 22, day before yesterday.
I didn' t tell anyone.
I did buy a bottle of champagne.
I thought I' d sit there, drink it by myself.
- That sounds absolutely sad.
- Oh, no!
It would' ve been just elegant, lying in a bath, drinking champagne.
- You couldn' t?
There' s nothing to it.
You think you could get it open?
I' m pretty sure I could.
I' ve got an idea.
I' il go up and get it.
It' s in the icebox with the potato chips and my underwear.
- Do you have champagne glasses?
- Yes.
Good!
We' il have a wonderful time.
The man says it' s very good champagne.
- Shall I bring the potato chips too?
- Sure, let' s shoot the works.
Honorable mention in U. S. Camera.
U. S. Camera.
"News Events.
Children and Animals.
The Human Body. "
Champagne glasses.
Champagne glasses.
Where' s the phone?
Hello?
Who is it?
Oh, Helen.
Well, this is a surprise!
And a pleasant one.
How are you?
Sure, I' m all right.
Why shouldn' t I be all right?
Everything is just fine.
Did I know Ricky forgot his paddle?
Sure, I will.
I' il send it off first thing.
Good night.
Who dropped in after dinner?
Tom MacKenzie?
Good old Tom.
How is he?
Drinking?
Who, me?
Whatever gave you that idea?
I was sitting here reading a book about driftwood.
It' s interesting.
Some of the formations are --
I' d better hang up.
The bathtub is running over.
Good night.
Night!
Sorry, I was on the phone.
A friend of mine in the country --
Oh, say!
It isn' t right to drink champagne in pants.
Would you mind fastening my straps?
Oh, sure.
Sure.
Potato chips, champagne.
You really think you can get it open?
I' ve opened one or two before in my life.
It' s simply a matter of pressure and counter- pressure.
- There she goes.
- You' ve sure got powerful thumbs.
I used to play a lot of badminton.
Get the glasses.
Quick, quick!
The glasses!
- Pour it.
- Seems to be stuck.
That' s silly.
Give it a good yank.
This never happened before.
The bubbles create a vacuum.
Let me see if I can do it.
I' il try to twist it.
- You' re married!
- I am?
Yes, I am.
You look married.
Actually, my wife and I are separated.
Separated in the sense that she went away for the summer.
- Any children?
- No.
Well, just one very little one.
Finger' s getting numb.
I could call the plumber.
He' s very good at this.
No, let' s keep the plumber out of it.
Grab hold of the piano.
Careful, I had my appendix out last year.
- Are you all right?
- Fine.
Do you wanna waste it now that you know I' m married?
I think it' s wonderful that you' re married.
Just elegant.
- You do?
- Of course.
I wouldn' t be lying on the floor with some man if he wasn' t married.
That' s an interesting line of reasoning.
With a married man it' s so simple.
I mean, it can' t possibly ever get drastic.
- Have a potato chip.
- ln what sense can' t it get drastic?
- People keep falling in love with me.
- I can believe it.
- They get this strange idea.
- I believe that too.
They ask me to marry them.
All the time.
I don' t know why they do it.
- Maybe it' s a kind of nervousness.
- Maybe.
I don' t wanna get married.
Not yet, anyway.
That' d be worse than living at the club.
I' d have to get in by 1 again.
Very true, you would.
At least occasionally.
That' s what' s wonderful about a married man.
No matter what, he can' t ask you to marry him.
Right?
- Right.
Am I ever a married man!
I' m the most married man you' il ever know.
And I promise...... l will never ask you to marry me, come what may.
- Well, how about some music?
- Fine.
Let' s see what we' ve got here.
Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky.
Hey, how about this one?
Rachmaninoff, the Second Piano Concerto.
You look to me like a big Rachmaninoff girl.
Funny, I don' t know anything about music.
You don' t have to.
Just listen to it, that' s all.
This is classical music, isn' t it?
There' s no vocal.
Don' t talk.
Don' t fight it.
Relax.
Go limp.
- Like this?
- Yes.
Let it sweep over you.
I got the biggest thing for Eddie Fisher.
Frequently, people go to pieces listening to this.
- No kidding?
- Yes.
It quakes them.
It shakes them.
Makes them goose- pimply all over.
Did you ever dunk a potato chip in champagne?
It' s real crazy.
Here.
- lsn' t that crazy?
- Yeah, pretty crazy.
We' d better send Rachmaninoff off.
This wasn' t such a good idea.
Don' t worry, everything' s fine.
A married man, air conditioning...... champagne and potato chips.
It' s a wonderful party.
Hey!
Look, you' ve got U. S. Camera!
How about that!
I' ve got U. S. Camera.
I bought a dozen copies of this but people kept stealing them.
Why would they do that?
That' s me, right there on the beach.
My hair was a little longer then.
Did you notice?
No, I didn' t.
Let me ask you something.
When they took this, there must' ve been some passersby.
How did they keep the crowd back?
It was taken early in the morning.
Nobody was up.
- Except -- You see that shadow?
- ls it a sea gull?
He kept buzzing the beach.
Maybe you' d like me to autograph this before I leave.
You' re not leaving yet, are you?
- How about more champagne?
- Love some.
Just freshen it.
Oh, I' m awfully sorry.
Here.
We should have some music.
Do you play the piano?
Not anymore.
Just a little as a child.
- Go ahead, play something.
- Well, all right.
Let' s see if I remember this.
It' s a little tricky.
"Chopsticks"!
I can play that too.
Shove over.
I don' t know about that Rachmaninoff, but this really gets me.
- It does?
- And how.
- I can feel the goose pimples.
- Goose pimples?
Don' t stop.
Don' t stop.
- Why do you stop?
- You know why.
Because now I' m going to take you in my arms and kiss you...... very quickly and very hard.
Hey, wait a minute!
- What happened?
- I don' t know.
This is terrible.
Except that I' m terribly sorry.
Nothing like this ever happened to me before.
This happens to me all the time.
This is unforgivable.
The only possible excuse is that I' m not quite myself tonight.
Maybe it' d be better if you would just go.
- Why?
- Please go.
I must insist.
Take your potato chips and go.
All right, if you really want me to.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I think you' re very nice.
Nice!
You' re crazy, that' s what you are.
Helen' s gone for one day and you' re running amuck.
Smoking, drinking, picking up girls, playing "Chopsticks."
Not like this.
Look at those bloodshot eyes.
Look at that face, ravaged, dissipated, evil.
One morning you' il look in the mirror and that' s all.
The Portrait of Dorian Gray.
- Good morning, Mr. Sherman.
- Good morning, Miss Morris.
- Mr. Brady get in yet?
- Yes, he came in early.
Put this on my desk.
- Of course.
Would you like me to get coffee and a doughnut?
No, thank you.
Have you had breakfast, with the family away?
I' m capable of fixing my own breakfast.
I had a peanut butter sandwich and two whiskey sours.
- Mr. Brady.
- Oh, Sherman, come in.
Well, what is it?
I' ve been with this company for years, and I' ve never asked for a favor.
- You had a raise in February.
- I' m not talking about that.
This is more important than money.
I want two weeks off to join my wife and son in the country.
This is our busy season.
We' re preparing our fall list.
I' m very tense and upset.
lf I could get back with my wife --
- How long have you been married?
- Seven years.
ln a few years, you' il be delighted to get rid of them for the summer.
Shipped them to Nantucket yesterday afternoon...... and I haven' t been to bed since.
Drank bourbon, smoked cigars, played poker till this morning.
Never felt better in my life.
I may not go to bed at all till the family gets back in September.
lf I stay in New York alone...... there' s a chance I may not live to see September.
That' s ridiculous, Sherman.
You' re just a little lonely.
What about us teaming up tonight, seeing if we can get lucky?
It doesn' t have to be just poker.
We' il cut loose and have us a real hootenanny.
It' s very kind of you, but I don' t think -- No hootenannies.
Suit yourself, but I' ve been thinking about that fall list.
What would you think of a 25- cent reprint...
-... of The Portrait of Dorian Gray?
- Dorian Gray?
Look what we' il be giving them for a quarter!
Vice, lust and corruption.
On the surface, clear- eyed and healthy, just like you.
The termites of sin and depravity, gnawing at his soul.
How does that strike you?
No.
Chapter six:
"The lnfidelity Pattern in the Married Male...... or the 'seven- year itch.'
A study of 18, 000 marriages conducted by myself...... leads us to believe that the 'urge curve' in the husband...... rises sharply during the seventh year.
This phenomenon is humorously...... referred to as the seven- year itch.
Far from humorous, this unfortunate urge...... strikes 84. 6% / of the married male population...... rising to an alarming 91. 8% / during the summer months. "
Changed my mind.
Gustaf Meyerheim, the mad lover of Leipzig.
An extreme, but not unusual case of the seven- year itch...... occurred in Leipzig, Germany in 1912.
Gustaf Meyerheim, happily married for seven years...... suddenly -- "Seven years!
- Dr. Brubaker to see Mr. Sherman.
- Doctor, you' re early.
Yes, my 3: 00 patient jumped out of the window.
So I' m ahead of schedule.
Which door?
This one.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Sherman.
- Dr. Brubaker.
I see you' ve been working on my book.
Very important.
- It has something for everyone.
- Yes.
You' il be happy to know that we' re giving it a big promotion.
You' il be seeing this in every drugstore in America.
- "Of Sex and Violence"?
- We had to soup up the title.
What does this represent?
Gustaf Meyerheim, the mad lover of Leipzig...... terrorizing one of his victims.
May I remind you that Meyerheim was small, with a red beard?
Nobody knows that.
They know it in Leipzig.
And all his victims were middle- aged women.
Don' t you think it' d be more effective...... to show a man terrorizing a young girl, sales- wise?
I heal sick minds.
I find ways to root out insecurities, neuroses, inner tensions....
What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- Does that mean something, doctor?
- No, nothing serious.
- Dark clouds on the psychic horizon.
- That' s preposterous.
A twitch in a thumb, a nerve or a muscle.
Of all the ridiculous....
- Are you very expensive?
- Very.
- I' m sure you make exceptions.
- Never.
lf a case really interests you?
At $50 an hour, all my cases interest me.
lf you run into something spectacular, another Gustaf Meyerheim --
You wouldn' t believe this, but last night...... l found myself terrorizing a young lady.
That could account for the thumb.
I just made a little boo- boo.
Psychoanalysis doesn' t recognize the boo- boo as such.
Everything is unconscious.
I was completely conscious.
I told her to take her potato chips and go.
- Potato chips. lf you please....
- All right, doctor.
I' m in serious trouble.
I' m married.
"Serious trouble.
So far, normal.
I' ve been married for seven years.
I' m coming down with what you call the seven- year itch.
- What am I going to do?
- lf something itches, scratch.
There was this lady.
Everything went black.
I terrorized her, I attempted to terrorize her.
The attempt was unsuccessful?
All I did was knock us both off the piano bench.
You attempted to terrorize...... a young lady on a piano bench?
Yes.
And on whose person was this attempt committed?
I brought this with me.
I didn' t wanna leave it lying around the house.
That' s her.
Her hair was a little longer then.
It' s called "Textures" because you can see three different textures.
It got honorable mention.
I congratulate you on your good taste.
lnteresting driftwood formation too.
I' il give you my advice.
Do not attempt it again.
But if you should, give yourself room to work in.
Do not attempt it balanced on a piano bench.
Such an attempt is doomed.
- Don' t we all?
Your time is up.
lf you find yourself in need of further analysis, phone my office.
As for my book, we' il resume discussion as your... has subsided.
lf she tells anybody about this, I' il kill her with my bare hands.
A possible solution.
But murder is the most difficult crime to commit.
Until you can commit a simple act of terror...... l strongly advise you to avoid anything so complex.
Goodbye.
I' m in big trouble.
Girls like this can' t keep their mouths shut.
This' il be all over New York.
I bet right this minute she' s telling someone about it.
He made me sit on his piano bench.
He made me play "Chopsticks."
Then he turned on me.
He was frothing at the mouth...... just like the creature from the Black Lagoon!
I knew it!
That' s how these stories get started.
Big blabbermouth.
He forced her onto the piano bench.
I know him very well.
He was in here for dinner, 260 calories.
He forced her to sit on the piano bench...... and then he made her play "Chopsticks."
It' s spreading.
It' s like jungle drums.
Everybody' s talking about it.
I forgot she' s on television.
50 million TV sets in America.
And now with the coaxial cable...!
I had garlic dressing at dinner.
But he' il never know...... because I stay kissing- sweet the new Dazzledent way.
Now that I have your attention, I want to warn all you girls...... about an evil, dangerous, married man...... living downstairs in my building.
His name is Richard Sherman.
S- H- E- R- M- A- N.
While his wife and son are in Maine...... this monster is terrorizing the girls of New York.
Mommy, come quick!
They' re talking about Daddy.
He makes them sit on the piano bench...... and makes them play "Chopsticks."
Then suddenly he turns on them...... just like the creature from the Black Lagoon!
Well, I might as well face it.
She knows everything.
She knows, she knows, she knows.
But maybe she doesn' t.
Maybe there isn' t any TV up in Maine.
I can' t go on like this.
Why don' t I just call Helen?
The minute I heard her voice, I could tell if she knew anything.
All right, call her.
Hello, long distance?
I want Ogunquit, Maine.
Ogunquit- 42831 J. Yeah, thanks.
What' s taking so long?
Maybe she' s talking to the lawyers already.
Hello, hello?
Bad connection.
Who?
Who is this?
I wanna talk to Mrs. Sherman.
Who is this?
Oh, the babysitter.
Look, this is Mr. Sherman.
Where is Mrs. Sherman?
What do you mean she' s on a hayride?
With whom is she on a hayride?
Mr. MacKenzie and some people?
What people?
What was the message?
Ricky' s paddle.
No, I forgot.
Something came up.
I' il send it first thing in the morning.
Goodbye!
- Mr. Sherman?
- What is it, Miss Morris?
Do you need me anymore tonight?
No.
We' ve come to the end of a perfect day.
Let' s go home and enjoy the simple things.
The good things, the real things.
The laughter of a child.
A flight of swallows winging their way back home.
Life can be beautiful, Miss Morris.
Hey!
Good evening.
I just washed my hair.
That' s nice.
Goodbye.
Oh, no, not tonight.
This girl' s a pistol.
Why press my luck?
I promise you that.
Take a shower, poach an egg, rinse a shirt, hit the sack...... and that' s all.
lf she was washing her hair for me, is she kidding?
How lucky can you get?
I' m glad she' s having a good time.
People to go out with, take her on hayrides.
What' s she doing on a hayride with MacKenzie?
I wish she wouldn' t hang around people like that.
He' s capable of making a pass at her.
She' il probably like it.
She' s getting older.
I' m probably very dull.
And MacKenzie is a writer.
That last book of his!
All that downwardly pulsating...... and hair spilled across the pillow.
No woman is safe around a guy who writes stuff like that.
No, Tom, please.
The other people!
I have a confession to make.
Look around.
- There are no other people.
- Don' t be angry.
I should be.
No, Tom.
What about the driver?
- There is no driver.
- No driver?
I thought of everything.
Even the horses are wearing blinkers.
- Tom, I' m afraid.
- Afraid?
Of me?
No, of me.
Oh, darling!
Downwardly, pulsating, striving.
Now together, ending and unending.
Now, now, now!
What a cornball.
Okay, good luck.
lf that' s the way you wanna play it, I can play it that way too!
Kaufman.
Kaufman.
Kaufman.
Hi!
Did you know you left your tomato plant down here last night?
I' d be glad to bring it up.
Maybe you' d like to have dinner.
Then maybe we could go to an air- conditioned movie.
Didn' t you love the picture?
I did.
But I just felt so sorry for the creature at the end.
What, did you want him to marry the girl?
He was scary- looking, but he wasn' t really all bad.
He just craved a little affection.
A sense of being loved and needed and wanted.
That' s an interesting point of view.
Do you feel the breeze from the subway?
lsn' t it delicious?
Sort of cools the ankles.
What would be fun to do now?
- It' s getting pretty late.
- Not that late.
I have this big day tomorrow.
I have to get to sleep.
What' s the big day?
I told you, The Dazzledent Hour.
Oh, here comes another one.
Tell me, Dazzledent toothpaste, I don' t think I ever tried it.
It' s excellent.
Oh, yes, I use it myself.
- Then you do recommend it?
- Definitely.
It costs a little more, but 8 out of 10 oral hygienists --
lf I believed commercials....
- You can believe this one.
- What' s that you say?
I stay kissing - sweet the new Dazzledent way "?
- Now really.
I' il prove it to you.
Well?
My faith in the integrity of advertising is restored.
However, before I switch brands, I wanna make absolutely certain.
A successful businessman like Kaufman...... probably makes 15, 000 a year.
Spends a fortune on sculptures but will not put in air conditioning.
I bet it was 95 in the bedroom last night.
Poor kid, it' s awful.
Good night.
lf you wanted to drop by my place to cool off...... before you face that Turkish bath up there....
I left the air conditioning on full blast.
It' s cold in there.
- Maybe for a few minutes.
- To bring the body temperature down.
I feel no matter how much it costs...... if you' ve got to sell the kids' bonds...... l say in the summertime in New York...... you' ve got to have air conditioning.
Just feel that.
I didn' t tell you, but I have air conditioning in every room.
The kitchen, the bathroom, the bedroom.
- Heaven!
- You just relax.
I' il fix two drinks, and we' il have a nice, quiet talk.
This is really the most!
Well, what shall we talk about?
How about psychoanalysis?
I don' t know how much you know about it, but it' s a hobby of mine.
What gets me is spending $3. 95 for that miserable fan.
It' s absolutely useless.
I' il take it back to the store to get my money back.
Just hope I didn' t lose the sales slip.
Two days ago we were strangers...... and now you' re here alone with me.
Why did we meet?
The answer lies in the unconscious.
lf they won' t take back the fan, the larger size is only $3 more.
But what about tonight?
I' ve just got to get some sleep.
There are no accidents.
Nothing happens by itself.
We make it happen.
You didn' t accidentally brush the plant, you pushed it.
Maybe if I took the fan, put it in the icebox...... and left the door open...... then left the bedroom door open and soaked the sheets in ice water....
No, that' s too icky.
Your behavior is obvious.
You pushed the plant down to kill me.
And why do you suppose you wanted to?
Could it be, could it possibly be because you love me?
Of course I could simply ask him if -- I' m sure he wouldn' t mind.
He' s such a nice man.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Under this veneer we' re all savages.
Man, woman, hopelessly enmeshed.
It' s too late to run.
The beguine has begun.
What are we going to do?
I' ve been thinking about it and I....
Yes?
I' d like to stay here with you tonight.
I' d like to sleep here.
- Are you sure?
- That is, if you don' t mind.
We don' t wanna rush into this.
There are savages, and savages.
This may be too savage.
lf you want to spend an hour here --
Don' t make me go to that hot apartment.
I haven' t slept in three nights.
I' d like to look good tomorrow.
I could sleep right here in this chair.
I' il be as quiet as a mouse.
Please?
Well, that' s different.
Of course you can sleep here.
We' re civilized people.
- Thank you.
What time do you get up?
- About 8, I guess.
- I' il fix you breakfast.
- Fix my breakfast -- Wait a minute.
Suppose someone sees you leaving the apartment at 8.
Just one person sees you, and we' re dead.
All right then, I could get up at 6 and sneak upstairs.
Get up at 6 and sneak -- Sneak!
Suppose someone sees you sneaking out?
We' re not doing anything wrong.
Certainly, but there' s such a thing as society, laws, rules.
But after all, no man is an island.
- Who is it?
- It' s me, Mr. Kruhulik.
- What is it?
- I was just coming home.
Went out with a lady, the one with the big, fat poodle.
I thought it might be a good time to pick up the rugs.
At 1: 30 in the morning?
Are you out of your mind?
I promised your wife.
Those moths are probably right now chewing away big, gaping holes.
I give you my word...... the moths are not eating anything.
Come tomorrow, early, before they have their breakfast.
You can' t trust a moth, Mr. Sherman.
They get hungry at night...... so they start looking around for a snack and --
- Oh, I wish I was dead.
- What' s the matter?
I didn' t quite understand the situation.
ln a situation like this, who cares about moths?
Situation, Mr. Kruhulik?
What situation?
Let them eat the curtains.
Who cares?
Go, man, go.
This may seem unusual.
- But it' s the most natural thing.
- I' il say.
"Summertime, and the living is easy.
Fish are jumping, cotton is high. "
The young lady lives in this building.
- There' s been a terrible accident.
- Hi.
Well, hello!
lsn' t she a living doll?
This lady' s tomato plant fell down.
Sorry to disappoint, but that' s all there is to it.
ln fact, I' m glad you dropped in.
It' s here.
I watered the garden with a cocktail shaker.
A little silver shaker.
You can see your insinuations are preposterous.
A natural mistake, Mr. Sherman.
What a doll!
- Right out here, Mr. Kruhulik.
- What a shambles.
It' s all right.
I have a policy.
Thank you, Mr. Kruhulik, and good night.
Good night, Miss -- Whatever your name is.
Be careful, it' s heavy.
Don' t strain anything.
I' m strained already...... from carrying that big, fat poodle around.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
I' m sorry.
But you can see how it is.
No man is an island.
Normal.
Everything is absolutely normal.
Go to sleep.
How can I possibly sleep?
What' il I do?
Write to Helen.
Write a long letter to Helen.
Paddle, that' s it.
I' ve got to send the paddle.
Little Ricky out there on the lake without a paddle.
Ricky needs it.
Going to get his paddle.
How do you wrap a paddle, anyway?
Paper and string, what else?
I need a piece of paper the shape of a paddle.
All right, nothing.
Hey, there' s some gauze in the bathroom.
I can bandage the whole thing, put some tape on it and --
And what, send it up in an ambulance?
This is ridiculous.
People send paddles every day.
The mails are full of them.
How do they do it?
That' s it, old newspapers!
Big deal, old newspapers.
Get a lot of string, slap it together....
Hi.
Forgot about the stairs.
I pulled out the nails.
You know what?
We can do this all summer.
Miss.
Young lady.
Got to get to the office.
Please, lady, get up, go home so I can get to the office.
No?
Poor kid, working in New York in this heat.
Standing there under those hot lights.
She must need money real bad.
Lives in an expensive apartment.
I know what clothes cost.
Buys imported champagne.
How can she possibly afford --?
She must have other sources of income.
Plenty of ways a girl can get money if she' s unscrupulous enough.
She could get herself some foolish, well- to- do married man.
Bleed him till he' s white, squeeze him till he' s dry --
They have a word for this.
They call it "blackmail."
Where is she?
She' s with Kruhulik.
They' re down at the bank going through my safe- deposit box.
Hello, are you in there?
Just taking a shower.
Be out in a minute.
Taking a shower, she' il be out in a minute, that' s all.
I should get one of the new towels and take it to her.
That would very definitely be another boo- boo.
lf anyone were to walk in, would they ever get the wrong idea.
Cinnamon toast for two, strange blond in the shower.
Explain that.
Tell them you spent the night wrapping a paddle.
Anybody walk in here!
Who' s gonna walk in here?
J. Edgar Hoover?
Arthur Godfrey?
Helen, maybe?
She' s in Maine.
How could she get here?
On the train, that' s how.
On the early morning train.
Why would she be coming to New York?
Because she knows something.
Because someone tipped her off.
Who could' ve tipped --?
Kruhulik!
He saw the girl here last night...... called Helen long distance and told her everything.
She' s on the train, I know it.
Early morning train' s in already.
She' s in a cab.
She' il be here any second!
There' s a woman in this apartment.
I know there is.
- No, Helen, it' s not true.
- Don' t lie to me, Richard.
Who told you?
Was it Kruhulik?
That' s right.
I' ve had him watching you for months.
His name' s not Kruhulik.
He' s a private eye named Johnny Dollar.
- What are you going to do?
- I' m going to shoot you.
I can explain everything.
The cinnamon toast, the shower.
This girl' s from Denver.
Spend a fortune on sculpture.
The drugstore wouldn' t take back her fan, she lost the slip.
I was just wrapping the paddle.
At least have the decency to keep the paddle of a child...... out of this sordid mess.
You' re mad.
You' il never get away with this.
Yes, I will.
There' s such a thing as the unwritten law.
Goodbye, Richard.
- Give me another chance!
- They' il give me a medal.
The wives of America will give me a medal!
Helen, I' m going fast.
Give me a cigarette.
You know what Dr. Murphy told you about smoking.
A cigarette.
Just one more cigarette, Dr. Murphy.
One more for the road.
For the long, long road.
Hi.
- What are you doing?
- I need a cigarette.
They' re right there on the table.
- What' s the matter with you?
- I' m all shot.
It' s because I took your bed and you slept on the couch.
I knew I should' ve taken the couch.
It' s not the couch, it' s my wife.
- She found out about us and shot me.
- She what?
Five times in the back and twice in the belly.
You' re just having a bad dream.
Yeah, I guess so.
Everything' s fine.
It' s just my imagination.
Some people have flat feet.
- I have this appalling imagination.
- I think it' s just elegant.
I just have no imagination at all.
I have lots of other things.
lf my wife walked in with you in the shower, she' d probably shoot me.
Of course. lf I was married...... and came in on my husband making toast for a blond, I' d shoot him.
- You would?
- Bang, bang, bang!
Right in the head.
Come on now, relax.
- You' re just making this all up.
- That' s right.
I don' t suppose if she had come in she' d shoot me.
She' d be mad, maybe throw an ashtray.
- Just that?
- She probably wouldn' t even do that.
lf she found you in the shower...... she' d probably think you were the plumber.
- Absolutely.
She trusts me implicitly.
- Doesn' t she love you?
- Oh, she loves me.
She worries about me.
I had a cough, and she made me stop smoking.
- She loves me, all right.
- lsn' t she jealous?
How can anybody be jealous of somebody with a briefcase...... who' s getting a little pot and can' t keep his eyes open past 9?
She trusts me.
It' d never occur to her that l --
Last Christmas, I came home with lipstick on my collar.
Helen said, "What' s that on your collar, cranberry sauce?"
- That' s bad.
Mrs. Brady.
Face it, no pretty girl wants me, she wants Gregory Peck.
How do you know what a pretty girl wants?
I don' t know, but I imagine --
You think every girl' s a dope.
From this she' s supposed to fall flat on her face.
Well, she doesn' t fall on her face.
But there' s another guy in the room, over in the corner.
Maybe he' s nervous and shy and perspiring a little.
First, you look past him.
But then you sense that he' s gentle and kind and worried.
That he' il be tender with you, nice and sweet.
That' s what' s really exciting.
lf I were your wife, I' d be very jealous of you.
I' d be very, very jealous.
I think you' re just elegant.
Thank you.
Aren' t you going to answer it?
- Answer what?
- The doorbell.
Go ahead, I' il put the cinnamon on the toast.
Tom MacKenzie!
- Morning, Dickie- boy.
- What are you doing here?
- Don' t call me "Dickie- boy."
- Got a date with my agent.
- ls that coffee I smell?
- No.
We' ve got important family business to discuss.
- Are you sure that' s not coffee?
- Positive.
My family?
I was driving down and Helen asked me to stop by and ask you --
She did?
I' m glad she did...... because I wanna talk to you.
What' s the matter, Dickie- boy?
You think you' re pretty fancy with the blinkers on the horses.
What horses?
And no driver and no other people.
- You drunk or something?
- No, I' m not drunk.
- You took Helen on a hayride.
- No, in fact, I didn' t.
And it was like a bus.
- That' s your story.
- I have terrible hay fever.
I' ve had it ever since the Army.
He went in and down --
ln and down. "lnwardly, downwardly pulsating!
Now together, ending and unending!
Now, now! "I know all about it.
- You' re drunk.
- Get out!
- lf Helen sent you to get a divorce -- - Divorce?
I absolutely refuse!
- She sent me for the paddle.
- I' il fight it in every court!
I can explain the stairs, the blond in the kitchen.
- Wait, what blond in the kitchen?
- Wouldn' t you like to know?
Maybe it' s Marilyn Monroe!
Blind, stinking drunk at 8: 30 in the morning!
I' il get six lawyers, I' il bribe judges, but no divorce!
Listen to me.
Helen does not want a divorce!
All she wants is Ricky' s paddle!
- Ricky' s paddle?
- The other kids are out on the lake.
You wouldn' t send his paddle!
lf anybody is gonna take Ricky' s paddle back...... l' m gonna take it back.
And I' ve got a good mind to punch you.
- Why?
- Because you' re a big lunk.
Strutting around in your vest with that I' m- so- handsome look.
- Let me tell you, Helen loves me.
- Sure, she loves you!
She loves me because I' m sweet and gentle and worried...... and nervous and shy and tender!
Breakfast is ready.
- Anybody you know?
- Meet Tom MacKenzie.
- How do you do?
- He came for Ricky' s paddle.
- I' m taking it to him.
- ls this a good time to pick up the --?
- I wish I was dead.
- Wait a minute, Kruhulik.
lf you wanna pick up something, pick up this.
What do you want me to do with him?
I don' t care.
Put him in mothballs.
Just get him out of here.
Boy, I' m telling you, lug the fat poodle...... lug the tomato plant, now lug this.
I' il be glad when the wives get home and things settle down.
The 8: 47, I can still make the 8: 47.
I can' t stay for breakfast, I' m sorry.
Don' t ever be sorry.
Do me a favor.
Call Brady & Company.
Tell Mr. Brady I' m taking two weeks off, whether he likes it or not.
You' ve got your own duplex.
Big, tall martinis, air conditioning.
- Thank you.
- Well, I guess that' s all.
- Just one more thing.
- What?
I have a message for your wife.
Don' t wipe it off.
lf she thinks it' s cranberries...... tell her she' s got cherry pits in her head.
Wait!
Hey!

- Ready Virge?
- Anytime.
Turn him out!
Get him.
Get on him, Bo!
Turn him over!
Get him over.
- What' s my time?
- Five- eight.
I' il win every prize they' ve got down at that rodeo!
Bo...... when you was 5, I throwed you on a horse, and you was riding.
- Yeah.
When you was 8, I throwed you in the creek, and you was swimming.
- Ain' t that right?
- Sure, Virge.
Splash!
You' re 21 years old, and we' re on our way to a big city:
Phoenix.
- It' s time you met up with a gal.
- A gal?
Nothing to be scared of.
Women and swimming is pretty much the same.
You got good reflexes.
You' il make out just fine.
[HORN HONKS]
- Two for Phoenix.
- We' re going down for the rodeo.
I' m gonna win me about every prize they got.
That' s nice.
You got a long ride ahead of you.
Bo, the lady' s hat!
- Oh, sorry, ma' am.
- Look where you' re going.
He ain' t used to traveling.
It' s his first time off the ranch.
Virge, that' s a lie, and you know it!
I' ve been all the way to Helena.
That was when he was 12, to have his tonsils out.
- That still counts!
- Give me that.
lf you will marry me, me, me lf you will marry me
l' il give to you a petticoat red All stitched around with golden thread
Virge?
I' ve been thinking, you know, about what you said.
What was that?
You know, about me finding a gal.
Oh.
What about it?
I don' t know anything about gals, Virge.
Nothing at all.
That' s what I mean.
It' s about time you learned.
Ain' t nothing to be scared of, Bo.
You liked swimming when you got used to it.
Besides, I know the idea crossed your mind.
I seen you looking at them pictures in Orville' s magazine.
l' il give to you a feathery bed With downy pillows for your head
Maybe I glanced at them pictures a couple of times.
But if I do find me a gal, it won' t be one from those magazines.
I' m gonna get me a angel.
- A angel?
- That' s right.
I wouldn' t set my sights too high if I were you, Bo.
You just pick out some plain- looking little gal...... with a cooperating nature and a good personality.
I mean, we gotta be realistic.
What' s some angel gonna want with a cowhand like you?
What' s that got to do with it?
That steer didn' t wanna get throwed.
Well, I throwed him.
Breaking in a wild horse...... you don' t let what he wants stop you.
What makes you think a gal' s different?
This trip will be mighty educational.
Kiss me quick and go my honey Kiss me quick and go
Listen, Virge, I' m gonna find me an angel, a real hootenanny of an angel.
She gives me any trouble...... she' il find herself with her wings pinned right to the ground!
- Morning, ma' am!
- What are you doing?
Pushups, to get the kinks out of my bones.
Get up off that floor.
Did 30 sit- ups too.
Stop bothering folks.
Woke up everybody on the bus.
It' s morning.
It' s time to get up.
Lay in bed all day long.
Then you get soft.
When do we stop for breakfast?
Look, there' s a place.
You passed it!
This is a public vehicle.
Stops where it' s scheduled to stop, no place else.
Meanwhile, what' s a passenger to do?
Starve to death?
Poor old lady' s stomach is rumbling.
Bo!
You' re in civilization.
Forgive him, ma' am.
He didn' t hear a thing.
Our next stop is Grace' s Diner...... couple of miles up the road.
That' s where we stop.
Grace' s!
Can we get some breakfast here?
- Hello, Grace.
- Look what the cat dragged in.
- Elma, you the passenger?
- Right.
- She' s going for the concert.
- And to see my sister.
Service!
- Your passengers are hungry.
- I' il go and wait on them.
Some crazy cowboys.
That young one is a real troublemaker.
His friend ain' t so bad.
He just sits playing guitar.
Little music' s nice when you' re driving along.
I' m very fond of music myself.
Are you, Grace?
I didn' t know that.
Yeah, I' m a very musical person.
Come on in.
I' il fix you something to eat.
Ma' am!
Ma' am --
Give me three hamburgers.
- Three?
How do you want them?
- Raw.
- Honest?
- That' s the only way to eat them.
With a hunk of onion and some pickle, and a piece of pie.
And a quart of milk.
He' s still a growing boy.
All right.
I' m growing too, but in a different way.
Gotta watch my figure.
Real nice place you got here.
Much as I' ve seen of it.
What does that mean?
I bet that apartment you got upstairs is real nice too.
I' d love to see it sometime.
Have you got it fixed up?
Don' t pour it!
Let' s get going.
- Hey, you!
- All aboard, folks.
Wait!
I happen to be the owner of this miserable restaurant.
Don' t pay him no mind, ma' am.
It' s just his way of talking.
- I don' t care for it.
- I don' t blame you a bit.
Virge!
This place is nice and clean and well- run.
You couldn' t ask for a prettier owner.
Wait a minute.
I mean it, and I wanna apologize for this barbarian.
- What you doing?
- Something I seen in a movie.
- It don' t offend you, I trust.
- No, just caught me up short.
Hand kissing!
That ain' t my idea on how to get a gal.
We know that.
- Bye, Grace.
- So long, honey.
- That' s right, ma' am.
I' m real fond of music myself.
All aboard.
Grace, see you in a couple of days.
So long, Carl.
Good luck in the rodeo, cowboy.
- Thanks, ma' am.
- Come back real soon.
[HORN HONKS]
- So long, Carl.
- So long, Grace.
Come back soon, hear?
[HORN HONKS]
Talk about angels!
How about her?
Well, she may be a angel, Virge.
- She ain' t my angel.
- How can you tell?
I' il know.
When I see my angel, I' il know right off the bat.
Take off your coats.
We' il be landing in Phoenix in an hour.
I' m sorry to leave you folks, but this is where we get off.
"Welcome, cowboys.
The town is yours. "
That' s us, Virge!
That' s us!
So long.
Don' t let him take any wooden nickels.
I' il drive you back, if you' re still in one piece.
Don' t you worry about us.
We' il be all right.
You just drive your bus.
Let' s register.
- ls that our hotel?
- Bo!
[BRAKES SQUEAL]
Bo, wait till the corner!
Remember, they go when it' s green, they stop when it' s red.
Never seen so many gals.
There must be a hundred head of them!
[BRAKES SQUEAL]
Bo!
Wait till it turns green.
Kiss me quick and go my honey Kiss me quick and go
You' re gonna wash yourself away!
Ain' t got this at home.
Shower and bath at the same time.
Bo, you have a terrible habit of overdoing everything.
Come on!
lf you' re gonna dawdle, I' m gonna step across the street.
That Blue Dragon seems interesting.
I' il be there in a couple of minutes.
Wait outside!
Why aren' t you outside where you belong?
I' ve had enough of you, you ignorant hillbilly.
Get to work!
Better change into your costume.
- He called me an ignorant hillbilly!
- Ain' t you?
Not ignorant, but you do come from the Ozarks.
I ain' t sung hillbilly since I was....
Well, not since I turned chanteuse.
I' ve been trying to be somebody.
Can you imagine Hildegarde doing her number...... sitting in some truck driver' s lap?
- I don' t know why you just don' t quit.
- I can' t.
I don' t get paid till Wednesday.
I owe for my room and everything.
Besides that, it took me too long to get this far.
- What' s that line for?
- That line?
You might say that this line here is a history of my life up till now.
- See right there where it starts?
- Yeah.
That' s River Gulch, the little old town where I was born.
- I never even heard of it.
- Well, it ain' t there anymore.
Floods washed us all away, all except me and my sister, Nan.
I just picked her up and took her along this line...... till we got to Lubbock, Texas.
You know what happened there?
Nan got this job as a waitress, and I worked in Liggett' s Drugstore.
And this amateur contest opened...... and Nan said to me, "Why don' t you enter that contest?
We used to live in the movies.
"You' ve watched people put over their gestures."
And so I did it, and I won it.
- First prize?
- No, second prize.
Two boys juggling milk bottles won first prize.
Anyway, that' s how I got my direction and all.
- Direction?
- lf you don' t have a direction...... you keep going round in circles.
Look, you can see by this just how straight my direction is.
River Gulch.
This is where I am now.
And look where I' m going.
- Where?
- Hollywood and Vine!
Look, straight as an arrow!
River Gulch...... Hollywood and Vine!
What happens when you get there?
You get discovered.
You get tested, with options and everything.
And you get treated with respect too.
What' s going on in here?
She' s changing into her costume.
You want her out there naked?
Take care of them tables.
Come on, Dinah Shore.
Them cowboys is getting real lonesome.
Zip her up.
Go zip yourself up.
He looks like the safest.
I never know what to say.
It' s easy.
Just say some cute little joke.
I' m so dry, I' m spitting cotton. "
That' s a real cute one.
Go on.
Hello, mister.
- Howdy.
- I wonder if you' d buy me a drink.
I' m so dry, I' m spitting cotton.
That' s a good one, it is.
Whiskey for the lady, beer for me.
l' il give to you a paper of pins
And that' s the way our love begins
lf you will marry me, me, me lf you will marry me
You sure have a good head for whiskey.
I' m not keeping track, but that' s four in a row.
Oh, that' s the way I am.
Sometimes I drink all night long.
Happy days.
What you doing?
Let go of me.
- That ain' t whiskey.
- Let go!
- That' s tea.
- That' s all they let us drink here.
Last night I had to drink 15 tea and sodas.
You' ve been hustling me for drinks!
I can' t stand a woman making a sucker out of me!
[BAND STRlKES CHORD]
Ladies and gentlemen!
But we got this little floorshow and we have to do it.
Hope it don' t disturb you none.
Okay, baby, take it away.
[MUSlC STARTS]
That old black magic has me
ln its spell
That old black magic that you
Weave so well
Those icy fingers up
And down my spine
The same old witchcraft
When your eyes meet mine
The same old tingle....
- Bo.
- That' s her, Virge.
That' s my angel.
Angel?
She' s just a gal works in a saloon.
Look at her gleaming there...... so pale and white.
BO:
Quiet!
Quiet!
Shh!
Keep quiet over there!
Shh!
Shh!
[MUSlC STOPS]
Bo, Bo....
That' s better!
Now keep it quiet!
SPECTATOR:
Sit down, cowboy.
- That goes for you too, mister.
Quiet!
Okay, miss, you can go on with your song now.
- Where were we, Henry?
"I should stay away."
[PlANlST STRlKES CHORD]
l should stay away
But what can I do?
l hear your name
And I' m...... aflame
Aflame with such
A burning desire
That only your kiss, kiss
Kiss can put out the fire
For you' re the lover I have waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time Your lips meet mine
Darling, down and down I go
Round and round I go
ln a spin, loving the spin
l' m in under that
Old black magic called love Love
Love, love, love
What' s wrong?
The lady' s finished.
You can start your yammering again.
Go ahead, start yammering!
I' m 21, and I own a ranch in Montana.
I got a herd of cattle and horses...... and the finest sheep, hogs and chickens.
And you' re it.
I don' t have time to sweet- talk...... so I' d be obliged to you if you' d step outside with me.
What' d you say?
My name is Beauregard Decker.
I' m 21 years old, and I own my own ranch in Timber Hill, Montana --
- I heard all that.
- Let' s get out of here.
No, uh... l' m mighty grateful to you for what you did...... but we' re not allowed to go out with the customers.
But you can buy me a drink if you want to.
- I' m so dry, I' m spitting cotton.
- I don' t use it.
I ain' t got time.
I wanna be in bed by 10: 00.
I' m in the rodeo tomorrow, so I need my sleep.
- Will you come on?
- We' re not supposed --
- Hold my hat.
- Where you going?
- Splash!
- You' re sure a good singer.
- I' m a chanteuse.
That' s why I call myself "Cherie."
That' s my name, Cherie.
- That' s all the name you' ve got?
- That' s all you need.
Like Hildegarde.
She' s a chanteuse too.
Cherry.
Cherie!
It' s French.
It means "dear one."
Beauregard is kind of French.
It means something too.
- What' s it mean?
You' d laugh.
- No, I wouldn' t.
- Yes, you would.
Honest, I wouldn' t.
Well...... it means "good- looking."
I never told that to a single person.
My ma was French.
That' s a real pretty name.
Beauregard.
Real beauregard.
Everybody just calls me Bo.
- Cherry.
- Cherie.
It was nice how you made everybody shut up.
Like you had respect for me.
You made them have respect too.
- I liked that.
- You did?
- Yes.
- Did you like me too?
At first, I thought you was some kind of a hooligan...... yelling and stomping like that.
But when I realized you was doing it for me...... l was attracted to you.
Attracted?
- You was?
- I still am.
You still are?
Really attracted?
Uh- huh.
- It' s only a physical attraction.
- Physical?
I mean, you' re so big and strong and...... well, so darn healthy looking.
Guess I am in pretty good shape.
You gotta be to compete in all five events --
Cherry.
Beauregard.
Sir, have you seen Cherie?
The gal you were sitting with.
She went off with another customer.
I was worried.
It' s time for the second show.
After all, it was your idea.
- What was?
- I' ve found me that gal like you said.
Cherry and me, we' re engaged.
- We' re what?
- Engaged.
Virge, I want you to meet Cherry.
Cherry, this is Virge.
He' il be living with us.
- We already met.
- Someone' s got the wrong idea here.
- What do you mean, Cherry?
- I told you my name is Cherie.
I can' t say it fancy like that.
What' s the matter with Cherry?
Well, it ain' t dignified.
Bo....
The rodeo starts tomorrow afternoon.
We' il get married out there!
- Married?
Out where?
- At the rodeo.
Tomorrow, after the finals, we' il all catch the bus back.
You don' t know nothing about this gal.
I know she' s my angel, that' s good enough for me.
Your angel was hustling me for drinks.
Sixty cents a shot.
And it wasn' t whiskey she was drinking, it was tea.
Of course it was, Virge!
Angels don' t touch no liquor!
I gotta kiss you again!
I just can' t help myself.
Cut it out!
Everybody' s looking.
Ain' t no crime when we' re getting married tomorrow.
We' il be very happy together, till death do us part.
I better get to bed.
Virge, come on, let' s get going.
We' il make the rest of the plans in the morning.
For a wedding present...... l' il get you a deep- freeze or an electric washer...... or any other major appliance you want.
Good night, darling.
You' re on again.
What' s the matter?
What happened?
You know something?
I' m not quite sure.
This whole thing is probably my fault.
I told you it was about time you started learning about women.
I ain' t saying this gal you picked ain' t a good one to practice on.
But a fella can' t go marrying the first gal he meets.
- Why not?
- Better get your mind on that rodeo.
Fellas at the ranch got their money on you.
She has no intention of marrying you.
Yes, she has, Virge.
She' s got a physical attraction to me.
She said so herself.
[SCOFFS]
- Virge.
- Yeah, Bo?
What' s the difference between a physical attraction...... and just a regular attraction?
A gal can be attracted to a fella...... for lots of reasons.
- His mind, for instance.
- His mind?
Like if he' s smart or reads poetry...... or something.
- No kidding?
- That' s right.
I can read and write.
I don' t know no poetry, but I can recite the Gettysburg Address.
- Would that count?
- It might.
I doubt it, but it might.
That old black magic has me ln its spell, that old....
l should stay away but what can I do l hear your name
Cherry!
Yes?
- Morning, ma' am!
- Wait a minute.
I' m waking her up.
[KNOCKlNG]
Let' s get a little air.
- Young man, I don' t allow callers --
Get out of bed.
The parade starts at 10: 30.
- I don' t want any trouble.
- How do I know you' re engaged?
Cherry, wake up and tell her you know me.
What?
- Oh, it' s you!
- You see, she knows me.
For the love -- I don' t know what' s going on....
We gotta get going.
We' re getting married today.
We got lots to do.
What' s the idea, busting in here like that?
- What time is it?
I' ve been up for hours.
Nine!
I didn' t get to bed till 5!
Five?
No wonder you' re so pale and white.
Cherry, know what that is out there?
That' s the sun.
I' il call the police.
You shouldn' t stay up so late.
When we get up to the ranch, we' il hit the sack every night at 7: 30.
We better get something straight.
I have no intention in the world of marrying you.
- So get it out of your head.
- We' il talk all that over on the way.
You see, the problem is...... you just haven' t had time yet to get attracted to my mind.
I know all about your mind I ever wanna know.
I know the Gettysburg Address.
Busting in here like a wild lndian of some kind.
Cherry?
What?
"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth a new nation...... dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we' re engaged in a civil war...... to determine whether any nation so conceived can long endure.
- We are met on a battlefield -- "- I hate parades.
I' m not going.
"The world will not remember what we say here...... but it' il never forget what they did here.
- It is for us to be...
- Let me sleep.... so concentrated and so dedicated.... "
Any further and you' il miss the parade.
Elliot, got anything?
Would you hold it please, miss?
We' re from LlFE.
LlFE magazine?
That' s right.
Or "rodeo" to you.
They wanted me to ride in the parade, but then I couldn' t see it.
Excuse us.
Come on, we' re gonna see us a parade real good.
You didn' t let me get no sleep.
Hop up on my shoulder.
You can rest and see good at the same time.
- Bo, you put me down!
- This is a nice arrangement.
Can you see everything?
I' m glad I' m not in this parade so I can see it.
Here come Daniel Boone' s men!
This is a hootenanny of a parade.
Look at them boys.
Ain' t they talented?
Ain' t they resplendent?
Look, there' s cowgirls, and they got --
Hi!
Where is he?
- You gonna marry him?
- No!
- Then you gonna go to the rodeo?
- No.
- What you gonna do?
- Run away.
What' s going on up there?
Who you signaling at?
Vera is a friend of mine.
She' s gonna get two tickets to the rodeo to watch you.
Get two tickets for the rodeo.
Two?
Yahoo!
Stop it!
We' re watching.
You' re doing just -- CHERlE:
Hello there.
Stop it, Bo!
Sorry, lady, you' re over there in the bleachers.
Over there?
It' s so much nicer here in the shade.
That' s right.
Come on, honey.
They got us over here with the livestock.
We go into our first contest of the afternoon:
Cowboy saddle bronc riding.
The contestant is required to ride 10 seconds.
That was Duane Howard from North Dakota.
The next rider up is Guy Weeks from Texas.
There' s Casey Tibbs, five- time World Champion Rider...... twice All- Around Champion Cowboy of the World.
Watch our pickup man as he recovers Casey Tibbs, South Dakota.
It' s him!
- Tell him to go away.
He' s gonna ride now.
We' re at the rodeo!
- What' s that green thing?
- That ain' t green.
Know what that is?
That old black magic That' s gonna make me win
Ain' t that your scarf?
So that' s where it went!
We have a newcomer from Timber Hill, Montana:
Bo Decker.
- I can' t look!
- You are stuck on him!
Good work, Bo.
How about a hand?
Bo Decker.
Yahoo!
Yahoo!
You know, I think he is crazy.
Sure he is.
I told you he was.
He thinks we' re getting married this afternoon at the rodeo.
What makes him think that?
Sure weren' t nothing I said.
After the parade, he dragged me to City Hall...... and bought a marriage license.
You didn' t sign nothing, did you?
I had to.
He was making such a fuss in front of all those people.
Honey....
Here' s a ride to watch.
The cowboy...... has drawn the toughest horse in our contest.
Don' t fall off.
He fell off.
ls that a diamond?
It ain' t exactly a diamond...... but it ain' t exactly not a diamond, either.
- He paid $43 for it.
- No kidding!
Plus tax.
He made me take it, but it ain' t on my finger.
And neither is that wedding ring he bought.
Wedding ring?
Oh, honey!
Calf roping is our next contest.
lt' s a race against time, and every second counts.
Notice the work of the horse, keeping the rope tight.
I' m gonna pretend that calf is Cherry.
- I' m gonna get her and rope her.
- Don' t let the calf get away.
Get going, Cherry!
Here' s our newcomer again, Bo Decker of Montana.
Was that fast enough for you, Cherry?
Who is she, Bo?
Come on.
Photographers from LlFE.
They' re heading this way.
- LlFE magazine?
- They almost took my picture.
Quick, my lipstick!
Oh!
Would you please hand me my lipstick?
Smile!
Basic.
Thank you.
I didn' t have my lipstick on yet!
The most dangerous event is wild Brahma bull riding.
There' s an extra star.
We have Cousin Hugo...... our bullfighting chimpanzee.
lt' s his job to ride on the dummy and attract the bull.
Cowboy clowns also distract the bull...... when the cowboy gets bucked off.
Don' t break your neck.
lf I was to break my neck, I couldn' t get married.
Him breaking his neck is the only hope you' ve got.
Here' s our old friend Bo Decker.
He still wears that green scarf.
Let' s hope it brings him luck.
Good ride, Bo.
Cherry!
Did you see me ride that bull?
Cherry!
Stop it!
- Cherry!
- He don' t have no manners at all!
No, but he' s got something else.
And he' s gonna get some little gal, you just watch.
Well, it ain' t gonna be me.
Besides, how can we get married?
Silly.
Cherie, look.
Ain' t that a preacher?
Oh, my goodness!
Excuse me, please.
Where' s the one getting married?
Here?
- That' s right.
- Elliot!
- Boing!
There she is.
Cowboy' s girl.
Bo' s also entered in our bulldogging contest.
How do I get out?
To get to it you gotta go around --
Hey, where are you going?
Cherie!
You gonna be stomped to death!
Cherry!
What' s going on here?
Wait!
Where are you going?
- My shoe!
Cherry, come back!
Hey, somebody hold this thing for me.
She ain' t here, and I don' t know when she' s coming back.
I don' t believe you.
She' s here someplace.
She ain' t here.
We gotta go get you ready for the finals tonight.
Cherry!
He don' t give up that easy.
I' m gonna end up in Montana with him and a bunch of cows.
What are you doing?
We' il stash your suitcase at the club for a quick getaway.
That' s the first place he' il look.
lf you don' t show up for work, you won' t get an advance.
He' s in the rodeo.
You' re safe till it' s over.
Tell that cashier you gotta have money...... for your sick grandmother.
- My grandmother?
- I don' t understand that boy.
- What' s he got on his mind?
- Me.
I' m gonna find her, and I' m gonna marry her!
Get her off your mind till after the rodeo.
I ain' t gonna be in the rodeo tonight.
lf you go to the rodeo, I' il find her and hold her for you.
I' m not saying she' il marry you, but she' il be at the Blue Dragon.
- Okay, Virge, if you promise.
- I promise.
My poor old grandmother' s sick. lf I could just have an advance.
The boss has to okay it.
He' il be back when the rodeo' s over.
- Her grandmother' il be dead by then.
Let' s have a little drink.
I' m so dry, I' m spitting cotton.
Two whiskeys, miss.
Take it easy, I' m on your side.
I don' t want him to marry you, neither.
- You don' t?
- I sure don' t.
ls that it?
I didn' t say that.
- Suppose he' s as pure as driven snow.
- As a matter of fact, he is.
You trying to tell me --
He never even kissed a gal before he met you.
He spent his whole life pretty far out in the country.
I know what happens there.
I' m from the country myself.
I' ve been kissing boys since --
That' s it.
You' re kind of sophisticated for Bo.
He didn' t kiss like it was the first time.
Well, Bo picks things up real quick.
- First time?
- That' s right.
Sure ain' t never had that honor before.
I hate to put you through this, but I promised I' d keep you here.
But I didn' t say anything about where you might go after that.
Vera' s sure gonna miss you, honey.
Oh, what was I supposed to say?
- I never was good at lying.
- It ain' t that complicated.
We just talk to him a while, then you turn casually and say:
"The show is gonna start pretty soon.
I guess I better go powder my nose. "
Then you go to your dressing room where your suitcase is.
You change, climb out the window and get down to the bus station.
The rodeo must be over.
Where' s Bo?
I know what.
He' s probably yelling and pushing some helpless animal around.
Whatever gave you an idea like that?
Nice to see you.
I was afraid you got trampled in that crowd.
- Where you been, Bo?
- I had a couple of errands to run.
I bought us three tickets for tonight' s bus to Montana.
By the way...... there' s $4000 I got for winning every event at the rodeo.
Except steer wrestling.
They gave me a bum steer.
Another fella thought it up.
Well...... our gear' s packed and waiting outside in the taxi.
We' il stop by Cherry' s house and get her suitcase.
Your nose is kind of shiny, ain' t it, Cherie?
Oh!
Bo, the show is gonna start in just a minute...
... and I gotta go powder my nose.
Wait, you' re not gonna do your show tonight.
- I ain' t?
- You gotta go pack your suitcase.
It' s already packed --
I mean, I gotta go powder my nose.
Cherry, what' s the matter with you?
Are you sick?
No, I ain' t sick, Bo.
I just can' t lie to you.
I ain' t going to Montana with you.
- And goodbye forever.
Cherry!
You ain' t got the manners they give a monkey!
I hate you and I despise you!
And give me back my tail!
Cherry!
- Here' s your bag.
- Here' s your coat and hat.
Cherry!
You can change down at the bus station.
I didn' t mean to rip your tail off.
You can sew it back on.
Good luck, honey.
Thanks, Vera, you' ve been real sweet.
Let her go, Bo.
What do you mean, let her go?
Cherry!
Where' d she go?
Los Angeles, please.
One way. $9. 35.
Los Angeles bus at Gate 2.
Wait a minute.
Help me unload this stuff.
Forget her, Bo.
You' il find somebody else.
Hank told me about this new schoolmarm --
I don' t want no schoolmarm!
I want Cherry.
Cherry!
Cherry!
You just can' t take people places.
There' s laws against it.
- Which way is the Los Angeles bus?
Through there.
Miss, to the rear of the line.
Cherry, don' t get on that bus!
I ain' t gonna take no for an answer.
Miss, stand to the rear.
What are you doing?
Anything I ever wanted in this life I went out and got!
lf the ocean was whisky And I was a duck
l' d swim to the bottom And never come up
Rye whisky, rye whisky, rye whisky l cry
lf I don' t get rye whisky l surely will die
So if I get boozy My whisky' s my own
And them that don' t like me Can leave me alone
Rye whisky, rye whisky, rye whisky l cry
lf I don' t get rye whisky l surely will die
l' il eat when I' m hungry l' il drink when....
I' m sorry to wake you, but could you help me?
- What' s the matter?
- I' m being abducted.
- Abducted?
- You know, kidnapped.
By him.
Oh, that' s awful.
What are you gonna do?
I thought when we got someplace, I' d ask the driver to let me off.
We still ain' t no place at all.
Not only that, I' m freezing to death.
I don' t have much on under my coat.
You mean just your underthings?
No, it' s my costume, but it' s just a little old thing, without its tail.
lts what?
lts --
It' s a long story.
You' re shivering.
Don' t you have anything warm to put on?
- Of course.
- Here, hold this up for me, will you?
- Sure.
[TlRES SQUEALlNG]
Cherry?
Cherry, where are you?
Cherry!
Cherry?
What' s going on up here?
Get away from me!
I' m getting dressed.
You' ve caused enough trouble for one night.
I can' t figure it out.
Why don' t she like me?
Why?
Of course, if you loved him, it wouldn' t be so bad.
Yeah, but I don' t.
Not at all?
Some gals don' t like to be pushed and grabbed and lassoed...... and drug into buses in the middle of the night!
How else was I gonna get her on the bus?
Well, I' m asking you.
Go to sleep!
I don' t know why I keep expecting myself to fall in love, but I do.
I know I expect to someday.
I' m beginning to wonder if there' s the kind of love I have in mind.
- What' s that?
- I don' t know.
See, I' ve been going with guys since I was about 12.
Honest?
Pappy wouldn' t have it.
I never heard of marrying so young.
Down in the Ozarks we don' t waste much time.
I sure am glad I never married my cousin Malcolm...... because he turned out real bad, just like Pappy predicted.
But I sure was crazy about him at the time.
And I' ve been losing my head about some guy ever since.
Bo' s the first one that ever wanted to marry me...... since my cousin Malcolm.
Naturally, I' d like to get married and have a family and all them things.
But you' ve never been in love?
I don' t know.
Maybe I have and I didn' t know it.
Maybe I don' t know what love is.
I want a guy I can look up to and admire.
But I don' t want him to browbeat me.
I just gotta feel it.
Whoever I marry has some real regard for me...... aside from all that...... loving stuff.
- You know what I mean?
- I think so.
This storm is getting terrible.
There' s Grace' s lights.
We' il make it.
You can sneak off when I get off.
I can if that wild man don' t wake up.
I wish I had my chains on.
Shh!
[TlRES SPlNNlNG]
Shh!
That' s as close as I can get.
We' il have to walk from here.
You sure picked some night for traveling.
Come on in.
This is Cherie.
We need someplace for her to hide.
She' s being abducted.
- She' s what?
- You know, kidnapped!
Yes, that' s right.
By a man in the bus.
A cowboy.
lf I could stay here till the bus pulls out again, I' d appreciate it.
Bus ain' t leaving.
- Huh?
- Road' s closed.
The bus is staying.
It may take the highway gang the rest of the night.
The rest of the night!
Driver, are we staying here?
My aunt and uncle are meeting us.
Don' t you think we ought to wake those cowboys up too?
[KNOCKlNG]
- Well, look what the cat dragged in.
- Hi, Grace.
Who' s that with you?
Aren' t they cute?
They' re visiting their aunt.
Looks like they' il visit their Aunt Grace.
For tonight, anyway.
Everybody is.
Highway' s all closed up ahead.
Oh, now, ain' t that too bad.
GRACE:
I hear you' re carrying a kidnapper on your bus.
You mean that cowboy?
He ain' t kidnapping nobody.
He' s asleep.
Wake him up.
Couldn' t you let him sleep longer?
He' s had a busy day.
Two rodeos and a lot else.
Sure, let him sleep.
Works out better for everybody that way.
- How soon is the next bus back?
Ain' t no buses tonight.
You' re all stuck right here.
For the time, anyway.
You know something?
This is the first time we' ve had more than five minutes together.
- So what?
- I don' t know.
I was thinking about that apartment upstairs.
Sure would be nice to sit up there and listen to the radio.
Maybe have a couple of beers.
That wouldn' t be a hint, would it?
Elma!
Where' s this place we' re at now, anyway?
Here.
It' s so little, it' s not even on the map.
I sure am way off my direction.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Your hands.
You got real big hands.
I used to be all- state wrestling champ.
No kidding?
I always admire a man who can fight.
Hey!
Why didn' t anybody wake us up?
We might' ve froze!
Hey, close the door!
Cherry!
- How come you didn' t let me know?
- Shut the door!
How come you slip off the bus and come in here by yourself?
- Where was you brought up, in a barn?
What' s the matter, afraid of a little fresh air?
Man' s right, it' s cold out.
Don' t give him no right to insult my manners.
No man ever had to tell me what to do, did he, Virge?
That' s all.
Door' s closed now, so what you arguing about?
Cherry, let' s you and me sit down --
That' s your suitcase.
For crying out loud, will you leave me be?
- Ain' t that your suitcase?
- Yes, that' s my suitcase.
What' d you bring it in here for?
I' m asking you a simple question.
What did you bring it in here for?
- Keep away from me, Bo.
- Will you --?
This is between me and Cherry.
ls that what it was?
- Take your hands off of me!
- Tell me.
- You tell me!
- Okay, cowboy, leave the lady alone.
It ain' t none of your business.
I ain' t so sure.
A bus driver' s like the captain of a ship.
The welfare of the passengers is his responsibility.
- Anything happens in the bus -- - We ain' t in a bus!
We' re in a bus stop.
This here' s an official, authorized bus stop!
- Ain' t it?
- When the sign' s up.
You still can' t interfere between two people gonna get married!
We ain' t getting married, but you' re too bullheaded to listen!
Cherry, you' re gonna marry me, and I ain' t gonna discuss it no more.
- ls there a preacher around here?
- Down the road, but he' s asleep.
We' re gonna wake him up and put him to work.
Help!
Shut up.
I' il make you a good husband.
- Now, cowboy, put her down.
- Open the door, Virge.
Virge, open the door.
I ain' t gonna open it, Bo.
- You ain' t?!
- No.
You been against this from the start!
That' s right.
I figured she wasn' t good enough for you.
Now I figure you ain' t good enough for her!
- You' re gonna put her down?
- You' re gonna get out of my way!
- You' il have to fight me first.
- I love a good fight.
I can' t stand a bully.
- Who says I' m a bully?
- I do!
A man' s got to fight for what he wants!
There' s a difference between a fighter and a bully!
But you' il only learn that if someone beats the living tar out of you.
I' d do it myself if I was big enough.
But you ain' t big enough!
And neither is he!
Ain' t no man ever got the best of me, and there ain' t gonna be!
I' m willing to try, cowboy.
Just step outside.
Delighted!
Make them stop!
Save yourself a lot of trouble.
Go in there and tell her you' re sorry.
- I ain' t sorry!
- He never is, that' s his trouble!
I' ve had enough of you telling me what' s right and wrong!
No, you ain' t!
You can stand a little bit more!
Virge!
What are you doing?
I' m starting a fight.
He' s gonna finish it for me.
Remember, every time he hits you, it' s me hitting you.
- Do you hear that?
It' s me!
- And it' il be me hitting you back!
Move over, I' m getting cold.
[PUNCHES LANDlNG]
You' re doing great, mister!
- Gouge him, cowboy.
- Make them stop.
Come away from this window.
You don' t wanna watch things like that...... or you' re gonna grow up mean, just like all my brothers and cousins.
Sit down and behave yourselves.
You ought to be in bed.
Grace has a big bed upstairs, and a sofa too.
[GRUNTS]
All right, boys, lay off them gas pumps.
Had enough, kid?
Go put your coat on.
This is getting good.
Cherry....
Oh, Virge, make them stop before somebody gets killed!
Give up!
You ain' t got a chance.
- You had enough?
- No, he has to apologize to everybody.
And quit molesting that little girl!
- You heard what he said?
- Bo, you' re whipped, admit it.
Okay.
- Bo?
- Get away, damn it!
How about the promise, Bo?
- ls she gone?
- She' s gone.
- Okay, I promise.
- All right.
He' il be all right.
Come on, Bo, the storm is over.
I' m sorry it had to be like this.
It' s all over now.
Come on inside and wash up.
Get some coffee.
You can' t stay out here.
I can' t go in there.
She seen me get whipped.
Carl, honey, you was just plain tremendous.
But I think I earned a cold beer you' ve got in the icebox...... upstairs.
Snowplow' s out.
Shouldn' t be too much longer.
Come on, Bo, cheer up.
We' il be back on the ranch tomorrow.
I don' t care if I ever see that ranch again.
Lonesomest place I ever did see.
Just like going back to a graveyard.
- Morning, honey.
- They' re sleeping just fine.
Such an interesting story.
- Can I have a cup of coffee?
- Elma just run it through.
- Bo?
- Yeah?
This would be a good time to keep your promise.
- Why should you be so scared?
I' m gonna do it.
Just give me a little time.
I warn you, it ain' t gonna do no good unless you really mean it.
- I mean it.
- All right, then.
Go ahead.
Ma' am, I want to apologize.
- For what?
- For causing all that ruckus.
You don' t need to apologize to me.
I love a good fight.
You' re welcome at Grace' s Diner anytime.
- I mean anytime.
- Thanks.
I apologize.
- That' s all right.
- Thank you, miss.
- Have I got to wake him up?
- No, he can wait.
Virge, I can' t do it.
I just can' t do it!
- Why not?
- She seen me get beat.
You made me your promise.
You owe that girl an apology...... and you' re gonna say it to her.
Go on!
Well, don' t watch!
I' il do the dishes.
- I can do them.
No, you go on with the kids' breakfast.
Cherry?
Yes?
Cherry...... wasn' t right of me to do what I did to you, treating you that way.
Trying to make you marry me whether you wanted to or not.
Do you think you can ever forgive me?
I guess I' ve been treated worse in my life.
Well, I reckon that' s all there is to be said.
- I wish you luck, Cherry.
- I wish you the same, Bo.
Here' s your bandana back.
Thanks.
Oh....
Here' s your ring.
I wish you' d keep that.
All right, Bo.
- Well, so long.
- So long.
- Wasn' t so bad.
Have some breakfast.
- I ain' t hungry.
- Just have some coffee.
- I couldn' t get it down.
[PHONE RlNGS]
- Phone!
- Turn the water off, honey.
Grace' s Diner.
What?
Okay, I' il tell him.
Hate to wake him, but the road' s cleared.
Hey, Carl!
The road' s cleared.
Still awful slick.
Elma, better wake the kids up.
Bus will be ready to leave just as soon as I get my chains on.
Anybody wanna help me?
I' il help him.
Bo?
Yeah?
I wanted to tell you something.
It' s kind of personal, and embarrassing too.
But I ain' t the kind of girl you thought I was.
What do you mean, Cherry?
And I guess I have too.
What are you trying to tell me?
I just figure that since you met me at the Blue Dragon...... that you took it for granted that I' d had other boyfriends before you.
You had?
Yes, Bo.
Quite a few.
Virge tried to tell me that, but I wouldn' t believe him.
Well, it' s true.
So you can see....
You' re better off.
I ain' t the kind of gal you thought I was at all.
[BUS STARTS UP]
Cherry...... would I be molesting you if I was to tell you something?
No.
Well, since you brought the subject up...... you are the first gal I ever had anything to do with.
I never thought I' d hear myself saying that, but I said it.
Virge told me that, but I couldn' t hardly believe him.
It' s the truth.
You see, I' ve lived all my life on a ranch.
I guess I just didn' t know anything about women.
- 'Cause they' re different from men.
- Well, naturally.
All ready to roll, folks.
Feeling better, cowboy?
Ain' t the happiest critter that' s ever been born.
I feel a little shook- up myself.
How about shaking hands?
Go ahead.
He' s just trying to be friends.
I don' t mind.
- No hard feelings?
- No hard feelings.
There' s a nice state, miss.
Montana.
How about a cup of coffee, Grace?
- Nice fella, Bo.
- Maybe I' il think so someday.
Maybe we better be boarding the bus.
Cherry?
Hi, Bo.
Cherry, you won' t be getting on this bus.
I know that I promised not to molest you.
But if you' d give your permission that it' d be all right...... l' d like to kiss you goodbye.
I' d like for you to kiss me, Bo.
I really would.
- Whoa!
- What?
I think this time it ought to be different.
Golly.
When you kiss somebody for serious...... it' s kind of scary, ain' t it?
Yes, it is.
- Here they are, all breakfasted.
- I' m still hungry.
See you Wednesday.
- Keep that beer on ice, Grace.
Maybe next time I' il get a chance to finish it.
All aboard!
Come on, kids.
I turned down the heater.
Throw this water on the fire.
This bus stop is closed as of now.
Cherry?
Yes?
Virge has been figuring things out.
He says that seeing as how you had all them other boyfriends before me...... seeing as I never even had one single gal friend before you...... he figures that between the two of us it kind of averages out...... to things being proper and right.
That' s what Virge thinks.
What do you think, Bo?
I' ve been thinking about them other fellas, Cherry.
Well, what I mean is, I like you the way you are...... so what do I care how you got that way?
Oh!
That' s the sweetest, tenderest thing anyone ever said to me.
It' s hard for a fellow after he' s been turned down...... to get up enough guts to try again.
You don' t need guts, Bo.
- I don' t?
- That' s the last thing you need.
Anyhow, I just don' t have any now.
So I just have to tell you what I feel in my heart.
Yes?
I still wish you was going back to the ranch with me.
- Yeah, I do.
I' d go anywhere in the world with you now.
Anywhere at all.
- You would?
- Anywhere at all.
- You would?
- Yes, I would.
- You would!
- I would, I would, I would.
- You would?
- I would.
Yes, I would.
I would.
Virge, she....
She' s gonna marry me!
Ain' t it wonderful when somebody so terrible turns out so nice?
Our ranch is gonna be the nicest place in the world!
We' re gonna have an angel on it.
- Here' s your map.
- Here' s your bag.
- This old thing!
- I' il show you the way to Montana.
You got yourself another passenger!
- Come on, Virgil.
- Wait a second.
Come on, we wasted enough time already.
- What you waiting for?
Hear me!
- Bo, I ain' t going.
- You ain' t what?
You don' t need me to look after you.
Fact is, you got someone you gotta look after.
Here' s your wedding ring.
Virge, I wish you' d come.
I liked you long before I ever liked Bo.
- Folks, gotta get rolling.
- The bus can' t wait all day.
Virge!
You' re my buddy.
I ain' t gonna let you go.
You' re coming with us.
We want you to!
- Bo!
Let me be.
You can' t do it that way.
You can' t.
lf he don' t wanna come, you can' t make him.
Whatever I got left up there, the boys can have it.
- Goodbye, Bo.
- Come on, Cherry, let' s make it fast.
Why, you' re liable to freeze to death in that skimpy little thing.
But what about you?
You need something.
Yippie!
Uh- oh.
Bye!
Bye.

Farmers.
Let' s go.
Hold it.
There it is!
Get over here.
Now stop it!
Hello!
ls they dead?
They' d better be, cos I' m gonna bury 'em!
Let' s go.
My brother.
My brother.
He' s dead.
His shoulder and leg is pretty badly broken.
- You a doctor?
- Horse doctor.
But bones is bones.
Also a blacksmith.
Bring brother.
More in the centre.
God, we pass on to you the body and soul of this nameless peckerhead.
At least he went quick, and he ain' t going to suffer scurvy, the dysentery, spotted fever or the cholera not to mention other maladies contracted in consort with low women.
Or waste years digging in the dirt and finding dirt, like I have.
- Talk about him!
- You wanna be next?
And seeing how he survived all that, he could have been hit by timber, fall down a shaft, starved, get murdered or committed suicide on Christmas Eve.
What I mean, God, is you have no pity for your living children, so that' s why we' re asking you to be a little kinder to them when they' re dead.
So, with all due reverence, Lord, we pass on to you this corncracker' s body and soul to take him and to keep him...
I stake this claim for me and my new pardner, whatever his name is...
Forever and ever.
Amen.
Pull him up.
- Elisa.
That the name of your girl?
- Yeah.
I thought it might make a good crutch now that you seem to be getting around good.
Thanks.
It just don' t seem right, Mr Rumson.
You doing all the work and me getting half.
I mean, it' s your mule, your tools and all.
- It was your brother.
- Well...
Where I come from, we' re cautious of strangers who talk in an easy manner.
You got me down for some kind of low scuff from New Orleans?
Sell you patent medicine with one hand, pinch your purse with the other?
That' s what I was thinking.
Actually, you' re right, but I ain' t yet sunk to horse stealing.
I' ve salted claims, yeah.
And I' ve sold whisky to lnjuns.
Once a man come at me with a gun, and I killed him.
I can' t think of one commandment I ain' t shattered.
I never did fancy my parents, let alone respect or honour them, and I have coveted my neighbour' s wife...
Whenever I had a neighbour and whenever he had a wife.
And I gamble and I cheat at cards, but there is one thing I do not do.
I ain' t never gulled a pardner.
The one sacred thing, even to low scuff like me, is a man' s pardner.
Two pennyweight short of four ounces.
Pass me your pouch, I' il pour your share.
And, Pardner, I' il swap pouches with you anytime you say.
I meant no offence, and I appreciate you saving my life and all.
But what' s expected in return?
I like to know what crops I' m planting.
I expect you to come get me, cos I don' t want to die muddy drunk.
I expect you to be my companion and solace me.
What happens when you get in a fight?
lf four of anything come at me at one time, you might lend a fist.
Up until that, I can take care of myself.
You see, I don' t fight fair.
Well, I don' t fight at all unless I absolutely have to.
I got kind of a temper, and once I start, I just can' t quit.
Well, good.
Just remember that I' m on your side.
I hear a shopkeeper' s pulled into town with a wagon full of whisky.
What do you say I hoist you up that mule and we go get boiled?
I ain' t a boozing man, either.
Well, I am.
Town meeting tonight!
There' s gonna be a town meeting tonight!
Town meeting tonight, Ben.
- Ben!
Ben Rumson!
- Mooney!
This is my pardner.
- I thought you went back to lreland.
- I am.
I' m just passing through.
- It' s right on the way.
- Mooney.
- How' s it going, Willie?
- I ain' t won a hand in three weeks.
This is my pardner.
He calls himself Rotten Luck Willie, but that' s just to get the suckers.
You can' t beat him, so don' t play.
- I don' t gamble.
- Neither does he.
My name' s Ben Rumson.
This here' s my pardner.
And I' m buying whisky for any man that can stand up.
- I was sitting there.
- Now you' re standing there.
Whisky!
Ben Rumson, you have an outstanding account in the amount of $68 from Yuba City, and which you skipped town on me.
Skipped town on you?
I was run out.
Don' t you remember?
I want to be paid now before they run you out of this town.
Put that damn gun down and stand these boys the whisky.
Dry your hands before you weigh it.
We need supplies.
A pound of sugar, half a case of whisky, and pneumonia for Schermerhorn there.
Evening.
Horace Tabor, Worcester, Massachusetts.
When did you get in?
Arrived this morning.
Hit a vein this afternoon, and I aim to be back in Worcester by Christmas.
It says here California' s going to be admitted to the Union.
Just what it needs... law and order.
- That' s good news.
- Well, it ain' t to me.
It' s my policy to bust out of any territory the day it become a state
- and head for the wilderness.
- I don' t agree, sir.
You look around the human race, you wonder what was God thinking.
Ben Rumson!
You bloody old rumpot!
Mad Jack Duncan!
This is my pardner.
I heard you was in town.
Wait till I tell you what happened to Harry and Ernest and me.
- What?
- We never went home.
We' re having a dance.
Jump in!
Climb on, Pardner.
We' re going to a dance!
This town meeting will now come to order!
Order!
- Anybody seen Ben Rumson?
- He left here about 20 minutes ago.
- Thanks.
- Are you his pardner?
He owes me $80.
He said you would stand good.
Pardner.
- Can you help me get up on the mule?
- You all right?
I get melancholy every now and then.
It' s a disease common to mountain men who live alone a lot, but if you stay with me such times, I' il be OK.
All right.
Did Ezra Atwell come to you for that $80?
I stood good for you.
I guess this is what you meant, when you said you expected me to come get you muddy drunk in the street.
And now you' re gonna be my companion in my moment of despair.
- Well, you' re my pardner, ain' t you?
- I like you, Pardner.
I like you, Ben.
My mother and father' s dead, and my two brothers and myself, we worked the farm.
Then last year, my older brother, he took himself a wife.
Me and my kid brother decided to leave Michigan and come out here, maybe dig some gold, get enough money to buy some land.
Except now that he' s gone, I don' t have too much appetite for farming.
What about your girl?
- Girl?
- Yeah.
Elisa.
ls she gonna come out and join you, or did she marry your brother?
To tell you the truth, there is no Elisa.
I just read that name somewhere and made it up.
Them' s the best kind, but what I need now is the worst kind.
It' s a living hell up here, what with the bloody rain and the bloody loneliness, and that bloody, bloody wind.
Look at the women!
Look!
Two women!
Look at the two women!
There' s five women!
I wanna get one of them gals!
Women!
Women!
There' s 64 women coming into town!
Men, 80 women coming down the river!
Lady, I got $50 here in gold dust.
You can have it all if you let me hold the baby.
Very well.
No, I don' t want your money for it.
You' il hurt his feelings, Sarah.
Take it.
Look at them eyes, glowing like he just hit pay dirt.
He' s a girl, you bummer!
Would anyone else care to hold the baby?
- Not now, Jacob.
- Just where are you people from?
lilinois, originally.
I' m Jacob Woodling.
- This is my wife Sarah.
- And who is this fine young lady?
- Her name is Elizabeth Woodling.
- Your sister?
No.
My wife.
Your wife?
I thought that one was your wife.
- They both are.
- Holy Moses!
They' re Mormons!
- Du lieber Himmel!
- Nice work, old man!
- Can we get something to eat there?
- With $50, you can, sir.
Follow me.
- What the hell is a Mormons?
- lch weiß nicht.
Bridegroom, I don' t give a damn how a man prays.
There' s room in hell for all of us, but it just ain' t equitable, for you to be having two of something all of us got none of.
So I' il tell you what I' m gonna do.
Your mule' s lame, and I got a beauty that cost me $140.
I' il swap you straight, my mule for one of your wives.
Now, which one' s baby' s mother?
God knows I wouldn' t want to separate mother and child.
- I am.
- Good.
I fancied t' other one, I did.
- This is immoral.
- I hope so!
- The woman' s married.
- No, she' s not!
We don' t recognise plural marriage in California.
Then I bid $250 in gold for her.
- 260!
- 265!
Wait!
You can' t buy a woman for money.
Try and get one without it.
All right, what about it, Mormons?
Jacob, we need every penny, and I can' t bear another day of those martyred looks.
- There it is again.
- This ain' t a martyred look, Sarah.
This look is pure hatred.
Quiet!
Brigham Young has 27 wives, and he hasn' t had half the trouble with them.
Then simplify your life, Jacob.
Sell me.
But, Elizabeth, you don' t know what you' il get.
I know what I' ve had.
- Go ahead, Jacob.
- Gentlemen...
Out here I ain' t a Mormon.
Elizabeth is a headstrong woman, especially since her own baby died two weeks ago, but she' s given her consent to be sold.
Therefore, if any of you want to bid for her, so be it.
But let' s go outside, where there' s room for more people.
But these religious dogs are bloody greedy!
Come on!
Come on!
You wait here and feed the baby.
It' s not proper you standing on a block.
lf anyone wants to inspect you I' il send them in.
Order!
Order!
I intend to conduct this auction in an orderly manner!
And no bids in Spanish.
The last bid was $265 and two blankets. $265, two blankets and a jackass!
A two- pound sack of coffee, a two- pound sack of brown sugar...
Holbrook, even if she is bought, how will she marry who bought her?
She' il be married by the prevailing law of this community, which is mining law, and she will be treated like any other legal claim!
Order!
Order!
Order!
Order!
The man bids $275, four blankets, one pickaxe and a bedpan.
Mooney, there' s a woman in the saloon with a baby pressed against her breast.
That' s right.
Wait.
It ain' t every day that we got a woman in Atwell' s
- pressing her breast with her baby.
- That' s right.
Clendennon, there' s a woman in Atwell' s pressing her breast to the saloon.
I know, and we' re bidding for her.
Sam Fletcher bids $300, four blankets...
Ben, where you going?
There' s a breast in Atwell' s pressing a woman against her.
You better stay here.
- Look!
There' s another one!
- He' s a Mormon.
He has two wives.
- I' il kill him.
- They' re bidding on her now.
What' s the bid?
Whatever the bid is, I double it!
$400 was bid last!
Mr Ben Rumson gallantly doubles that bid to $800!
800 once...
I' m his pardner, and he withdraws the bid.
- You have power of attorney?
- Power of what?
Written permission, signed and witnessed.
lf he could do that, he' d talk for himself.
- 800 twice!
- Wake up, Ben.
Come on.
Sold to Mr Ben Rumson for $800!
He only looks that way when he' s drunk.
I think you' il be agreeably surprised.
Dearly beloved, we have gathered together to grant this man, Ben Rumson, exclusive title to this woman, Mrs Elizabeth Woodling, and to all her mineral resources.
I have drawn up this record of claim, which here and henceforth will be recognised as a certificate of marriage.
So I ask you, Ben, do you recognise this claim as a contract of marriage, and do you take this woman to love, honour and cherish?
He does.
Elizabeth Woodling, do you take this man, Ben Rumson, to love, honour, and obey him until death do you part?
She does.
I now pronounce you claimed and filed as Mr and Mrs Ben Rumson.
I' il be glad to help you work your claim!
I' il be bedding down by the fire if you need me.
You' il not regret taking me in, I' il make you a good wife.
You sure as hell will.
I don' t fault you for taking me for an easy woman.
I was bought and paid for.
But you bought me for a wife, not a whore.
lf you come again at me again like a slavering dog, I' il shoot you!
Watch where you point that thing.
You' d blow my manhood halfway to the moon.
I mean to make you a good wife and honour this contract of marriage, but only if you will honour it as well.
I don' t know what you mean by honour it.
I know your sort of man.
My father was the same sort, born under a wandering star.
I ain' t fool enough to bond you with all the tyrannies of marriage.
All I want is your name, Mr Rumson, and the least measure of respect due to a man' s wife.
I want you to build me a cabin.
A cabin that' il stand up in winter with a fireplace of stone and a door I can bolt if I have to.
And if you do that, I will say you have honoured the contract.
But if you regret having bought me, say so now.
And if I have to work forever, I' il see you get your $800 back.
I admire your pioneer spirit and your straightforward manner.
- ls that what you' ve been admiring?
- I' ve been admiring you.
All right, I' il build you a cabin, and I' il give you my name proudly.
You' re Mrs Ben Rumson, and I' il kill any man that says you ain' t, and I' il stick to it till I move on, which is when the gold pinches out or the first snow of winter.
You ain' t gonna claim duress later just cos I held a gun on you?
No, ma' am, I ain' t going to claim duress.
I seem to lack all sense of shame with you.
These men came all the way from Fiddler' s Camp just to see your wife.
Hiya, Ben!
Looks like I married myself a tourist attraction.
Some of these boys hiked 15 miles.
Ben, how' s married life?
Pardner, it was so good, I forgot that I was married.
I' d hike 15 miles to look at that myself.
I can see it ain' t gonna be easy, married to the only woman in these mountains.
All right, boys!
The lady wants a cabin to live in, a proper cabin made out of wood that' il hold up in the winter!
So just don' t sit there gaping, get to work!
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth?
- Where have you been?
- Down at the rapids taking a bath.
You mean you was taking a bath?
I mean I was taking a bath.
What do you think I mean?
You was down at the rapids just now, bare beam and buck naked?
I' m not like to take a bath with my clothes on, Mr Rumson.
Are you trying to tell me you was taking a bath?
I was taking a bath.
- ln the middle of the night?
Mr Rumson, in a community of 400 men, would you rather I took my bath bare beam and buck naked in the middle of the day?
- What' s the matter with you?
- What' s the matter with me?
I ain' t running around in the middle of the night in my drawers.
Hey, boys!
Listen to this.
"The proprietors of the Hares and Hounds Club in Sonora
"wish to announce that six ladies are expected to arrive by stage
"from San Francisco on the 15th of August."
- How about that.
- That' s a hundred miles away.
What good is that gonna do us?
Ain' t no one trying to steal your wife, Ben.
I' il admit there' s a few who wouldn' t mind trying.
Horace Tabor, for instance.
He likes to give her a look.
- Horace Tabor?
- Come on, Ben.
He just looks.
She doesn' t encourage him or anybody else.
But you' re beginning to cut a comical figure.
- Everybody' s laughing at you.
- I would' ve never thought of Tabor.
What the hell are you looking at, Horace Tabor?
I' m looking for my stirring stick.
You make any more advances towards my wife, and I' m gonna shoot you down like the dog you are!
And the rest of you horny gorillas!
You want something to do?
Put up your money for them six French tarts coming into Sonora!
But keep your lusting minds off of my wife!
I' d advise you, Rumson, not to refer to me as a dog again.
- ls that clear?
- I' il stick my fist in your ear!
- Why you...!
- Grab Tabor!
Stop him!
Get back!
Get ahold of him!
Mr Rumson!
- Rumson, I...
- Mr Rumson!
Nobody has behaved unseemly to me.
I have been treated with nothing but kindness in this camp, and you owe every one of these men, especially Mr Tabor, an apology.
By God, you' re right!
I don' t know what' s come over me.
I' ve been behaving like a damn fool, and I wish to beg your communal pardons, especially yours,
Horace Tabor.
I suppose if I was married to the only woman in the neighbourhood, I might be just as demented.
And, Mrs Rumson!
May I extend my compliments?
You are as wise as you are fair.
- Get your hands off!
- That lunatic tried to kill me!
I demand a town meeting to consider a proper course of action.
lf that knife had come one inch lower, I would not be here today.
- That' s right.
- Fellow citizens, as long as that madman prowls among us, no one is safe.
Therefore, we must find a solution by tonight.
Let us not wait until the condition worsens or his aim improves!
- Thank you.
- Order!
- Mr Chairman!
- The chair recognises Ezra Atwell.
I would like to ask Ben Rumson directly if he doesn' t think that with a little sober effort he could control these fits of jealousy?
No.
It' s getting worse every day.
Sorry, I can' t help you.
- The chair recognises Ben' s pardner.
- Thank you, Mr Holbrook.
I' ve been giving it some considerable thought, ever since Ben Rumson, my pardner here, poor bastard...
Excuse me, ma' am...
Well, ever since he became a lunatic.
What' s putting the strain on Ben' s mind is having the only woman for 90 miles around here.
My proposal is that we get some more women for this town.
How you gonna get women to come up here?
- Order!
Order!
- I know where we can get some women.
The six French bawds arriving in Sonora a week Saturday.
You' re right.
Let' s get them to come up here instead.
How? lf I was a French bawd, I' d go to Sonora.
lf you was a French bawd, we' d have no trouble.
How will we get 'em up here?
They gotta take the stage from Sacramento, and change horses at Starbottle' s Pass.
So five of us go down there, hijack that stage, re- route them tarts up here instead.
What' s so hard about that?
It all sounds just fine to me.
- When do we go?!
- Order!
Order!
ls it your proposal, Mr Rumson, that we knock out the stage driver, steal a coach and kidnap six women?
Sounds better every time I hear it.
- You don' t see what' s wrong with it?
- What?
lf you don' t consider assault and battery, grand larceny and kidnapping wrong, what the hell do you consider wrong?
- You maniac!
- Sit down!
- You insane man!
- Schermerhorn, you' re out of order.
- What?
- I yield the floor.
- Proceed, Schermerhorn.
- What?
- Speak!
- You maniac!
You insane man!
What do you think them people in Sonora will do when we hijack their Fräuleins?
They grab their guns and come up here to get them back!
Order, order!
- Gentlemen!
- Mr Atwell has the floor.
Gentlemen, it is 50 miles from here to Starbottle' s without a road or a trail.
Not even my mule can do it, how...
You lunatics!
Besides a civil war with Sonora, you want to put us in the white slave business!
Schermerhorn, you' re out of order!
- Again?
- You haven' t been recognised!
I' m Schermerhorn.
- Mr Holbrook.
- Oh, sit down!
Ben, these boys are right.
Mr Holbrook, I withdraw the proposal.
Have you gone out of your skull?
You can' t expect them to build a two- storey building
- just to get women here.
- Who said two storeys?
Somebody has to run the faro tables.
Rotten Luck Willie will.
You can' t expect him to build a fancy building with chandeliers and masterpieces of art and gambling, and six beautiful tarts upstairs.
We' d have every bummer for miles around coming here to spend his money on women and whisky at Atwell' s and Schermerhorn' s.
You think that' s bad?
Why, it' s terrible!
Just terrible!
You' d turn this camp into a boom town!
We don' t want to do that.
- Soon there' d be another saloon.
- And a bawdy house!
- And another gambling hall!
- And another bawdy house!
- Property would shoot straight up.
They' d make more money selling old claims than gold.
These men didn' t come out here to forge a nation!
That' s for men with a big dream, with visions of America' s greatness.
I' m warning you, if you want to turn us into a dreary boom town metropolis filled with nothing but millionaires, all you gotta do is put up one little, tiny two- storey cathouse!
I say let' s put it to a vote, and any man opposed is a traitor!
All those in favour of bringing prostitution to this camp, say aye!
Passed!
There' s a shifty side to you that I' m just beginning to appreciate.
- Why can' t I go along with you?
- Who' il take care of Elizabeth?
It' il take three days to get them tarts back here.
You don' t expect me to leave her alone in the middle of this?
Who can I trust if it ain' t you?
You didn' t say being pardners meant wife- guarding.
Well, it just come up.
- Howdy.
- Captain Barnsfeather, Fort Sumter.
- When does the Sonora stage come?
- About four o' clock tomorrow.
Why?
Supplies for the troops.
Unmount!
Come in, Pardner.
- You sure I' m not intruding?
- Come in.
Will Ben really get back in three days?
- Why?
- I' d like to know.
Who you expecting for dinner?
You!
Sit down.
Thanks.
I didn' t know you was expecting me.
They' re coming out of Starbottle' s!
All right!
Fall together!
Put me down, you bloody idiot!
Put me down!
- Down, down, down, down!
- Get in line!
Come on, move!
Captain Barnsfeather, Fort Sumter.
At your service, ladies.
Here to protect you along the way!
We' re gonna have to take this detour.
- A detour through open country?
- The road up ahead ain' t safe.
- lnjuns!
- Ain' t no lnjuns around here!
Get back in the coach, ladies.
- There' s a coach comin 'in!
"H" ere, Charlie.
More fortune cookies.
- Good luck!
- Thanks!
What?
Next week, we' il be selling Sanyo remote control VCRs for $299!
- Look, it' s Dad!
- Oh, no!
I' il go broke!
To give away Mitsubishi giant- screen television sets for $1, 299!
Oh, no!
We won' t be undersold on microwaves, videorecorders, ovens...
- Mom, you' re not looking.
- Please turn that off.
Mom, when are you going to stop being mad at Dad?
I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?
I have certain unresolved feelings about your father.
I don' t trust him.
- And I hate those commercials.
- All right, forget it.
We don' t have time for another heart- to- heart.
Come on.
You have to get dressed.
- I want you to understand it' s insulting...
- Watch your hair.... for him to go from me to that bimbo.
Do you think he really loves Janet?
Maybe he' s just smashed too many fortune cookies!
Mom, give me a break!
He' s missing the reunion because of you.
You know he' s dying to go.
At least we won' t both have a miserable time.
Let me see.
What do you think?
You are a very hip chick!
God, you look like you' ve stepped right out of Life magazine!
I don' t know.
What if nobody else there is dressed like this?
So?
- I don' t think I wanna go.
- Mom.
Everybody' s just gonna say, "Well, hey, where' s Crazy Charlie?"
Lots of people are separated and divorced.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
I feel ridiculous in this dress!
I' d like to change.
Why are you so nervous?
What' s the matter?
Reunions do funny things to people at this age.
- Hi, Peggy Sue!
Beth!
- Hi.
Hi, Maddy.
How are you?
You two look just like that soap commercial.
- "Which one' s the mother?"
- "And which one' s the daughter?"
You took this seriously.
You' re a real blast from the past!
It was Beth' s idea.
I wish I had the nerve.
And the figure.
- Hi.
- Hi!
Peggy Sue Bodell?
- All right.
- Mom?
Beth' s boyfriend is with the band.
- What does?
You and your mother.
You both seem to fall for musicians.
Mom, look!
Oh, God!
It' s okay.
Come on.
Look!
Why don' t you find a table?
We' il see you in a little while.
Sure.
God, Mom, that picture' s great!
Come on, let' s get a table.
- Is this good?
- Fine.
- I' il be right back.
You be all right?
- Sure.
Thank you.
We' re gonna do a little medley for you now.
- Come on, pose like your picture.
- What?
Hi, do you like it?
I figured as everyone has a gold Rolex, I' d have one made in platinum.
- What a wonderful idea!
- How are you?
I' m fine.
How many children do you have?
- I don' t have any.
I thought you did.
- No.
How many do you have?
- I have four.
- Four?
- Four, yeah.
I' m so happy for you.
- I love them so much.
- How' s Peggy Sue doing?
She was a mess, right after they separated.
But I think she' s coming out of it.
Seems to be friendly now.
I' m so glad.
Sometimes it' s easier when you hate them.
- How about a little dance, princess?
- Walter!
- How are you?
- Good.
- Nice to see you.
I' il see you later.
- Yeah.
Aren' t you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
I was once.
Richard Norvik?
I didn' t recognise you!
You look terrific.
You look exactly the same.
I feel ridiculous!
I only did this for tonight, you know.
- It' s adorable.
- Thank you.
Peggy Sue Kelcher, this is my wife, Sharon.
- How nice to meet you.
Why don' t you sit?
- Thank you.
But call me Peggy.
Peggy Bodell now.
So, where' s Charlie?
I was in town about a year ago and I turn on the television...... and I see Crazy Charlie.
It really made me laugh.
Charlie won' t be here tonight.
- We' re getting divorced, actually.
- I' m sorry to hear that.
Richard.
Doug Snell, Merrill Lynch.
I read about that Codex deal in Business Week.
Congratulations!
Thank you very much.
Peggy, how are you?
How' s Charlie?
Hey, Terry!
- Thank you, Doug, thank you very much.
- Call me.
Madeline Hutton and Arthur Nagle were high school sweethearts.
Married right after graduation, they' re still together.
How does it feel to have missed the sexual revolution?
What?
What kind of question is that?
That doesn' t have anything to do with the reunion, Delores!
Take it easy, kitten.
- Welcome to the singles scene.
- I don' t know how you do it.
I' ve never even dated anybody but Charlie.
It' s not that bad, really.
You just have to think of men like houses, and trade upward.
I always thought that you and Charlie had a really great marriage.
I think we did.
We just got married too young...... and ended up blaming each other for all the things we missed.
So he started having affairs and you started getting depressed?
You just should have left here years ago, like I did.
It' s not so bad.
I' ve got two great kids.
I' ve got my own business.
Still, if I knew then what I know now...... l' d do a lot of things differently.
Your damn computers put me out of business.
You' re right.
He' s drunk.
You' re a billionaire and I' m a goddamn failure.
No, the bakery' s doing very well.
- Do you manage it?
- I own it.
I remember that dress.
Rosalie?
Oh, no.
I remember that locket, too.
You were so excited!
I think you showed it to the whole school.
You have an incredible memory.
- It' s beautiful.
Does it open?
- Yes.
- These are my children.
- They' re so cute!
Of course, they' re not babies anymore!
But you were married when you were three, right?
God bless you!
Pure pharmaceutical grade.
A couple of lines of this, I could drill my own teeth.
- Who' s the guy with the eyes?
- Michael Fitzsimmons.
I used to have such a crush on him in school.
God, that Walter Getz can still dance!
Your first boyfriend!
Any sparks left?
Well, who knows?
I mean, remember, whatever Walter wants...... Walter gets!
I' m sorry.
Sharon Norvik.
This is Carol Heath and Maddy Nagle, my oldest and my dearest friends.
- Nice to meet you.
- Sharon is married to Richard.
- Lucky lady!
- Thank you.
Michael Fitzsimmons.
Is he here?
No.
No, I asked Rosalie.
She couldn' t track him down.
- That' s too bad.
- He must have been quite a guy.
Yeah.
You know, he is the only boy in high school I wish I' d gone to bed with!
Only one?
Well, besides Charlie.
I hope the sales of your book go very well.
Anything anecdotal you' d like to leave us with?
Yeah, every dog has its day.
Meaning what?
Peggy, would you please rescue Richard?
Ask him to dance.
Richard.
Would you like to dance?
Of course I would.
So, are we through now?
- No.
- Good.
From snivelling runt to pompous ass in 25 years.
That' s quite an accomplishment.
I really cannot get over this.
The only time people like Delores Dodge used to pay any attention to me...... was to laugh at me or insult me.
- You know that guy Doug Snell?
- Yeah.
He shook my hand when we walked in here?
He used to call me, "Four- eyed worm."
You showed them all.
You' re rich and famous and successful...... and you have a beautiful wife.
You were always friendly to me.
I appreciated that.
It' s Crazy Charlie, the appliance king!
You' re putting on a little weight, man!
You look great.
Great.
So, this is the reunion?
It' s wonderful.
Like, wonderful!
Are you and Peggy still talking?
I mean, is it amicable?
She hasn' t changed at all, Charlie.
- Your daughter' s a real doll.
- "Why, I oughta..."
"H" ello.
Hello!
Listen up!
Can I have your attention?
I know everybody' s having a great time...... but now, you have to get ready for that moment you' ve all been waiting for.
Dad?
Hi.
The Reunion Committee has selected a king and a queen.
Let' s get back to business.
The Reunion Committee has given this a lot of thought...... and decided on two people who best represent the spirit...... of Buchanan "H" igh' s Class of '60!
What are you doing?
The king is someone who, in more ways than one...... has come a long way since he left here...... and we are especially proud to welcome him back.
Richard Norvik!
Come on up here, King Richard!
I demand a recount!
That' s gotta be Getz!
First you gotta learn how to count.
Hold me back!
Well, I just want to say thank you.
Sharon and I feel real welcome.
We' re having a great time.
Boy, our high school looks really good from up here.
Thanks a lot.
- Now, every king deserves a queen.
- Over here!
Not you, Getz!
Life of the party!
But when we sent out the invitations...... we didn' t mention anything about this being a costume party...... and perhaps we should' ve...... because just looking at her brings it all back!
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our queen...... Peggy Sue Kelcher Bodell!
Come on up here, Peggy Sue!
I can' t do it.
Yes, you can.
Go on, you can do it.
Go on.
You can do it.
Congratulations.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Mom!
Now, hold your arm up.
Would you like your Twinkie now?
I want to suck your blood!
I also want to suck your Twinkie!
- No.
You are the undead.
Let' s have it.
You hate them, anyway.
Young man!
You stop that!
Hey, I just made a deposit in your bank.
Now I want to make a withdrawal.
I think it' s time for your next class.
- Go on!
All of you!
- I' m a little worried about the side effects.
Now, you lie back down.
What am I doing here?
You passed out for a minute, that' s all.
Nothing to worry about.
- But how did I get here?
- Why don' t you let your friends help you?
Take her into the washroom and splash some cold water on her face...... and that should perk her up.
- Yes, ma' am.
How are you doing?
Blood drive?
1960?
Wanna smoke?
No, Carol.
That' s the worst thing for her.
I gave them up years ago.
- Where is it?
- Where' s what?
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
I' m taking you back to the nurse.
- Delores, why aren' t you giving blood?
- I can' t.
I' m too anaemic.
Maybe you should drink some of that nail polish.
It might give you strength.
Why don' t you come back and show me how?
We' re going to take you home now.
That' s okay.
I' m sure I can remember the way.
Steady now.
People get weak when they give blood.
At 1280 on your AM dial, here' s more from our golden survey.
And now from The Champs, let' s party with a little Tequila.
- I' il call you later.
Let' s keep in touch.
Who is it?
Come on in.
I left the door open for you.
The nurse called and said you' d be coming home.
I have a note.
- How do you feel?
- I was excused.
Why don' t you go upstairs and lie down for a while?
It always reminds me of home.
Of course, dear.
You' re home now.
- You sure you' re going to be all right?
- Yeah.
What is going on?
Nancy?
It' s Nancy!
My baby sister!
- I' m so happy to see you!
- What are you doing?
Mom said you were sick.
You' re never happy to see me.
I' m sorry!
I' m sorry about that.
I want us to be closer.
I have too many unresolved relationships in my life.
Teenagers are weird.
And you' re the weirdest.
You wanna play a game?
Come here.
How about Monopoly?
Or Parcheesi.
Or Chutes and Ladders?
I have a question.
Let me turn the tables on you.
Maybe you, down here, don' t know.
Is there anybody in the house knows where Dion and the Belmonts are?
I don' t believe it.
He never ages.
Isn' t Kenny Rossi dreamy?
She thinks she' s so great.
- Don' t eat any of the red ones.
- Why not?
They' re bad for you.
They give you red lips.
What the hell?
I' m probably dead anyway.
Peggy Sue, get in here!
Dion' s almost over.
I left your laundry on your beds, girls.
Don' t forget to put it away, okay?
What' s for dinner?
Creamed chipped beef on toast with rutabagas.
Your father' s favourite.
Not again!
Evelyn!
Girls?
What is this out on the street?
Come and take a look!
Who left this out here?
- What is it, dear?
- Come on out and see for yourself!
Stop shouting.
It' s cool!
- Wait until I tell Diane.
She' s always bragging about her dad' s Cadillac.
What do you think, Peggy Sue?
Oh, Dad!
It' s funny.
It' s really funny.
You bought an Edsel.
Young lady, what' s the matter with you?
Are you drunk?
Just a little.
I had a tough day.
No, don' t wear it out, Nancy!
We can' t afford a new car.
Do we have to take it back?
I fail to see the humour of this!
Go to your room, you' re grounded!
- Grounded?
- Put that down!
That' s the story of my life!
I' m an adult.
I' m going to go to Liverpool and discover The Beatles.
Jack, take it easy!
She gave blood at school today.
- She' s a little lightheaded.
This is drunk!
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humour.
- Evelyn, put her to bed!
- Come on, Mom!
You' re making a mountain out of a molehill.
A tempest in a teapot!
My little baby.
Don' t try to grow up so fast.
Mom, I forgot you were ever this young.
Sleep, baby.
Good morning.
What happened to your hair, Peggy?
You have such a pretty face.
- Why are you always trying to cover it up?
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.
Excuse me.
Nancy, put your homework down and sit down.
You' re looking bright and chipper this morning.
I' m still here.
I thought I might as well enjoy myself.
I think I' il go to school today.
You know, Dad, I' m sorry about yesterday.
The Edsel is a classic.
Use it in the best of health.
Well, thank you.
But don' t ever let anything like that happen again.
You' re far too young to start acquiring bad habits.
I agree.
You know, Mom and Dad...... you are the best parents a girl could ever have.
I' m really gonna try and behave myself.
Sure you will!
Come on, Momma, sit down.
You want me to sit?
I mean, isn' t this great?
Just all of us here together!
Can I tell Charlie Peggy Sue got drunk last night?
Young lady!
I forgot about him.
What am I gonna do?
- Did you two have a fight?
- Sort of.
- About what?
- House payments.
How do you feel?
Pretty strange.
Come on.
Get in.
I can take care of that.
I have a headache.
Headache?
You drive like a maniac!
It' s not that I' m glad you were sick...... but it just gave me a chance to do some thinking last night.
- Yeah?
About what we said on Tuesday.
I think it makes a lot of sense.
- Refresh my memory.
- How could you forget?
We talk about seeing other people and you forget.
I must have blocked it out.
Yeah.
I guess I can understand that.
But, please, don' t start crying again.
It' s not gonna be forever.
I figure three years is long enough for the music to pan out, which it will.
I know it.
Start to see other people so that we can...... two:
We can comparison- shop.
And then, three:
Settle down and get married.
Why wait?
Why not break up now?
Because we got the prom coming up and all these parties.
- We don' t want to upset our parents.
- They' il learn to live with it.
Peggy Sue, come here.
Did you study for the test?
- Test?
There' s a test?
- Yeah.
All right, class.
Time' s up.
And what' s the meaning of this, Peggy Sue?
Mr. Snelgrove...... I happen to know that in the future I will have no use for algebra.
And I speak from experience.
- Who said that?
- I' m sorry.
Sit down!
The result of his struggle is that Santiago comes back with honour.
Santiago comes back with nothing!
There' s no meat on the bone.
It' s Hemingway' s ego trying to defend itself again.
Trying to prove he can still perform.
What Hemingway' s saying, Michael, is that we are alone.
That when we go out too far, we' re vulnerable.
The irony that Santiago is beaten by the sharks...... doesn' t make him less of a hero.
Who is the victim and who is the predator?
We' il finish this discussion next week.
And don' t forget, first four chapters of The Great Gatsby by Monday.
Hope you enjoy it.
Why does your father take inventory on Sunday nights?
It' s poker night.
You always got out of it before.
I just gotta string him along for a while.
It' s for his own good.
You' re not going into his business.
When are you gonna tell him?
Soon.
I can' t tell everybody everything all at once.
Strange rumours are sweeping the school about you.
What do you mean?
- I hear you gave it to old Smellygrove.
She told him off to his face!
Attagirl, Peg!
Arthur, please don' t call me Peg.
"Why, I oughta..."
I don' t get it.
That' s' cause you' re not a total moron like they are.
It' s a stupid movie thing they started.
That' s enough outta you, little lady!
"Why, I oughta..."
I' il be right back.
I wanted to congratulate you on winning the math contest.
It really wasn' t that difficult.
What are you doing?
You fishing for four- eyed worms?
Get lost, you macho schmuck!
I wanted to talk to you.
It' s really important.
I' m not doing any tutoring this year.
I' m too busy.
No, it' s not about that.
Would you meet me after school, please?
All right.
I' il be in the physics lab.
Make it 4: 30.
I have to go to a Rocket Club meeting.
Sure.
She' s not wasting any time.
- Peggy Sue and Mr. Square Root.
- He' s a nice guy.
He' s writing a book.
A book?
Excuse me for a second.
Why is she punishing herself?
Come on, Peggy Sue.
Try it again.
You haven' t been practising.
Sorry.
What a girl, what a twirl.
Peg "Leggy" Sue Kelcher.
A brief but glorious career as a majorette.
Looking good out there!
Thanks.
I love it when you twirl your baton.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch.
I guess I deserved it.
I' ve been thinking about my three- year plan.
I think it' s totally unworkable.
I must have been delirious.
I don' t know.
I thought it made some sense.
Well, in the abstract, maybe.
Get a good grip on yourself.
When I think about you going out with other guys, I feel...
Rejected?
Worthless?
Miserable?
Yeah.
Good.
Boy, that' s some kite!
I' m writing a book on kite construction.
So what do you wanna talk about?
I just wanted to ask you a question.
Do you think time travel is possible?
- Are you doing a science project?
- Sort of.
Well, that' s a very interesting question.
Well, now, let' s see.
If we look at this in a Newtonian framework...... the possibilities of time travel were limited.
With the advent of the relativity theory, that' s Einstein' s relativity theory...... the idea of absolute time cannot be reasonably affirmed.
Well, then we have Richard' s burrito.
What' s that?
That' s my own theory, based on a Mexican food called the burrito.
- I had one at Disneyland.
- I know what a burrito is!
You see, I think that time is like a burrito...... in the sense that one part of itself will fold over...... and it will just touch the other part.
- What' s inside?
- You can fill it with whatever you want.
Anything.
Then you think that time travel is possible for people?
Yes, it is.
It is possible.
It' s absolutely possible for people, dogs, elephants, cancan girls.
Then I' m not crazy!
I really don' t know if you' re crazy.
I know most people think I am.
- Come here, Richard.
- What?
- Come on.
- What are you doing?
Wait a minute, what are you...
You have to promise not to tell anyone!
- Okay.
I won' t.
- No, I' m serious.
No one else can know.
I won' t.
I promise, I' m not gonna tell anybody.
I have come here from the future, from 25 years ahead.
I think that you' re probably crazy.
I don' t have time for jokes.
- I know what you people think about me.
And I don' t appreciate it!
You' re just the smartest guy I knew to ask.
I know it sounds unbelievable, but I can prove it.
Well, proof is an excellent concept.
How?
You have a blind grandfather.
You' re gonna invent this machine that reads books for the blind.
You' re gonna invent a lot of things.
You' re gonna be really famous.
Wait a minute.
How did you know about my grandfather?
Because I' m telling you the truth.
I read about your invention in a magazine.
I know a lot of things that are gonna happen.
There' s gonna be test- tube babies and heart transplants.
An American...... named Neil Armstrong will be the first man to walk on the moon.
July 20, 1969.
1969?
That' s six years ahead of schedule.
I would be very careful about this if I were you.
What if you fall into the hands of some madman...... with plans to manipulate your brain?
- Well, that' s why I was getting a divorce.
You know what I really think happened?
I think I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
- You look great for a corpse.
- I' m serious.
- You' re giving me the creeps.
- Well, am I dead or not?
There' s one way to find out.
- Give me this.
- What are you doing?
Confucians say, "If you want a way out, go through a door."
There' s a fire truck.
If you' re dead, it' il pass right through you.
Now just stay there.
You' re dead.
Young lady!
No, I don' t wanna die!
It' s all right.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
I had it made into a cocktail ring, though.
This is good.
Well, there' s not a whole heck of a lot here.
- Very nice pieces.
- So, thank you.
I' il take them to the shop and have the appraisal ready next week.
- Good day, Mrs. Kelcher.
- Good- bye.
- Who was that man?
- That was nobody, Peggy.
I' m voting for the Democrats this year.
You know how your father feels about Democrats.
That was a polltaker.
I wouldn' t mention it, if I were you.
How was school today, darling?
It was nice to see everybody again.
I don' t know.
Everything they teach is so useless.
And the lunch!
God, that was the worst!
Get that, Peggy.
- Hello?
- Peggy Sue?
This is Grandma.
- Grandma?
- "H" ow' s my little girl been?
- Grandpa and I are very concerned.
- What' s the matter?
What' s up?
- It' s Grandma.
I' m sorry.
- What' s wrong?
Mom, I' il call you back.
It' s Peggy.
It' s okay.
I' il call you back.
Peggy Sue, what is it?
What happened to you just now?
What is this all about?
I dreamed that Grandma died.
Oh, baby.
No wonder you' re so upset.
She' s getting on, it' s true, but she' s fine.
I told her you weren' t feeling well yesterday.
She called to find out how you are.
I love her so much and I haven' t seen her in so long.
- Grandpa Barney, is he all right?
- He' s perfectly fine.
You saw them at Easter.
What' s this all about, Peggy?
I don' t know.
I forgot.
- I' il call her tomorrow.
I hate to see you so upset.
You' re my angel.
Peggy, I don' t mean to be intrusive.
But are you having problems with Charlie?
You mentioned something this morning.
A lot of things are confusing right now.
Charlie' s just one of them.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don' t think you should be doing?
What do you mean?
Peggy, you know what a penis is.
Stay away from it.
You' re the best.
Make her love me, okay?
Feed me.
Charge me.
Go get her, tiger.
Get the door, Jack!
Just a moment!
Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Mr. Kelcher.
- Come on in.
- How are things at the hat store?
- Very good.
Charlie, could I have a word with you?
- Something wrong, sir?
- No, not a thing.
I' d just like to talk to you.
Hi, Mrs. Kelcher!
- How do you do today?
- Good.
- You look wonderful.
- They' re delicious.
Sit down, Charlie.
That sounded really great, Nancy.
Charlie, you may have noticed that...... Peggy Sue has been acting a little bit strange lately?
- Indeed.
- She' s distorted!
Nancy, please.
She seems to be a little bit nervous and confused.
Over- emotional and even a little bit irresponsible at times.
Of course, her mother says, "That' s the way girls act sometimes."
She' s almost a juvenile delinquent.
- No!
- Out!
"Why, I oughta..."
Oh, God!
Yes, sir, but I think that' s what I like about Peggy, Mr. Kelcher.
She' s not like all the other girls at school.
Charlie, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music...... we' ve always regarded you as a very fine young man.
- Thank you, sir.
- And we' ve trusted you with our daughter.
Well, trust is a two- way street.
In the past two years...... l' ve been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher...... have provided your sacred trust with upbringing the woman...... that I plan to take off your hands.
Charlie' s downstairs.
Why aren' t you ready?
- For what?
- For Maddy' s party, that' s for what!
Mom, I don' t feel like going to a party.
Feel or not feel, you accepted the invite.
Maddy' s one of your best friends.
I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
You' re supposed to be doing your homework.
I need to talk to your sister.
Try and enjoy yourself.
This is the best time of your whole life.
The sooner you learn to handle Charlie, the better.
Stand up to Charlie.
Be a good girl.
Wear something cheerful.
Perky.
We think this party might cheer her up.
As long as you understand what' s expected of you.
What would that be?
Show her a good time, but for heaven' s sake, restrain yourself!
Of course!
Your sweater!
- It' s great, isn' t it?
- It' s really '50s!
It' s like you clash with the whole world.
What' s the fun of being a teenager if you can' t dress weird?
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night!
- Good night, Mom.
- Be good, dear.
- Good night, Mr. And Mrs. Kelcher.
- Good- bye.
Have a good time, youngsters!
You look really beautiful.
Thank you.
- I cleaned the car.
Do you like it?
- Yeah, looks better at night.
I got tickets for Fabian on your birthday.
You like him, right?
Yeah, he' s cool.
I was thinking of four ushers and four bridesmaids.
The Yankees have the pitching, but the White Sox have defence.
What will your colours be?
Kubek and Richardson any day over Fox and Aparicio.
Pink and green.
- Look, Carol!
- What?
Look at Delores.
What a tramp.
My God!
I think that pitching wins pennants.
The Tigers have got four twenty- game potential winners.
You' d be surprised at how many girls in school aren' t virgins.
Like who?
Don Mossi, Frank Lary, Jim Bunning and Paul Foytack.
- "H" ello?
- Hello!
And now, direct from four weeks of rehearsal in Walter' s garage...... four guys who have prided themselves on becoming the best group in the world.
Walter, Leon, Terry and Charlie, The Definitions!
Charlie can really sing!
Maybe they' il be the next Dion and the Belmonts!
I wouldn' t count on it.
Come on!
Where' s your enthusiasm?
He really is kind of cute, isn' t he?
Yeah!
He really loves you, too.
You' re so lucky!
He' s always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
- He is?
- Yeah!
Carol and I saw you with that creep Richard Norvik today.
First of all, he' s not a creep.
He' s exceptional.
You' d know that if you took any time.
You just pity him since he has no friends.
If you weren' t so neurotic and insecure...... maybe you could shut up and show some compassion.
Are you for real?
I don' t know what you said to her, but I wish I' d said it.
Hi, fellas.
- What do you think about Richard Norvik?
- He' s a nice guy.
Is he going to help you with all that physics stuff?
He' s trying.
Who needs physics when we' ve got chemistry?
Put on some make- out music and turn out the lights!
There' s not a girl in school that can hold a candle to you.
You' re pretty charming when you want to be.
I know.
But I don' t have to flatter you.
It just feels right.
You' re the perfect girl for me...... as in:
Is, was...... and always will be.
I' m glad dancing was invented.
You know, the first dances were rituals.
Like fertility rites.
I always loved the way you kissed.
I missed you.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.
And the tide rushes in.
You really love me, don' t you?
You know I do.
I even wrote you into my will.
Charlie, let' s make love.
What?
You mean sex?
Intercourse.
You want to have intercourse?
Last weekend you said...
What time is it?
Holy cow, it' s late!
A lot of things have happened since last weekend.
You were the one who said we should wait and you were right.
We should wait till we get married.
I know I must have believed that...... when I said it, but...... doesn' t Lucky Chucky want to come out?
You know, your love machine.
Your throbbing thrill hammer.
Your thing.
You mean my wang?
Listen, it' s running real late!
Come on!
What is this?
What the hell is going on, Peggy Sue?
One week you say, "If you love me, you won' t."
The next week you say, "If you love me, you will."
That' s a guy' s line!
Forget about it.
I made a mistake.
You' re damn right!
Jesus, Peggy, you sure know how to spoil a mood.
I' m sorry.
Save it, woman!
Humiliator!
I was very impressed with what you said in English class today.
Gilford' s okay, except that he thinks that Hemingway' s great literature.
And you don' t?
He' s a fisherman.
The most overrated writer of the century.
I mean, man, he is the perfect American author:
Fat, violent, drunk.
Maybe you' re confusing his life with his work.
A writer' s life is his work.
Jack Kerouac doesn' t have to kill a bull to have something to write about!
I mean, man, he' s out there burning, feeling, grooving on life!
"The young man leaned back in his chair.
"No bulls would die today."
What are you doing here, anyway?
Coffee, donuts.
I thought chicks like you travelled in packs.
Man, I' m a hip chick.
- Come on, Delores.
- Terry, slow down!
What?
Look, there' s Peggy Sue with Michael Fitzsimmons!
- That Commie beatnik?
- First a geek and now a weirdo!
This is great.
This is great reefer.
It must belong to Beth.
I found it in my dress.
It' s really old.
It travels well.
Well, the world sure looks better up here.
The world is fantastic.
It' s the ultimate absurd circus.
And I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
What are you shooting for?
Maximum intensity.
I' m going to get out of here.
I' m going to write.
I' m checking out of this bourgeois motel.
Push myself away from the dinner table and say:
"No more Jell- O for me, Mom!"
Don' t you get along with your parents?
All my father digs is money.
All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Come on!
They care about you.
- They' re just a different generation.
- What' s with you?
I thought you were cool.
You blew some pot.
What' s your scene, Miss Majorette?
You going to marry Mr. Blue lmpala...... and graze around with the other sheep for the rest of your life?
No.
I already did that.
I want to be a dancer.
That' s what I want to do.
I' m going to dance and dance.
Come here.
You know, I had you pegged all wrong.
"Ray of oneness piercing the solitude
"Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh"
Is that one of your poems?
No, I just made that up.
- Do you want to hear one?
- Yeah.
It' s called Tenderness.
"I couldn' t sleep so I thought I' d scream
"Betrayed by a kiss Sucking pods of bitterness
"In the madhouse of Doctor Dread Razor shreds of rat puke
"Fall on my bare arms"
I' m sorry.
I was trying to impress you.
Michael.
You' re as good as you looked.
"How many loved your moments of glad grace
"And loved your beauty with love false or true
"But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you
"And loved the sorrows of your changing face"
I didn' t write that.
That' s Yeats.
I envy you.
You have your whole life ahead of you and you know exactly what you want.
But no more rat puke, okay?
Try and write something beautiful.
I' il respect you for eternity.
You know, this really isn' t happening.
- And one Shostakovich.
- Shostakovich?
Charlie, I' m just taking Ravel!
Take the Shostakovich home.
Listen to it.
Let it grow on you.
If you don' t like it I will give you your money back.
I did like the Dvor?
I liked that a lot.
And, young man, you talked me into it.
It' s the most definitive Dvor?
You' il like it.
I kid you not.
- What do you know about classical music?
But selling is selling.
Charlie, about last night...
Hush, baby, hush.
I' ve been thinking.
Girls must go through that stuff, too.
Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal.
I don' t know.
Maybe my dad' s right.
Teenagers are nuts.
But I' m not.
I' m a grown woman with a lifetime of experiences you can' t understand.
Girls mature faster than guys.
But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes.
- And do you know why?
- Why?
Because nothing else matters.
That' s the great thing about love.
Every time we argue...... every time something goes wrong, and I know I' m not perfect either...... things just work out better in the end.
Because you' re my baby.
And I love you.
Charlie, what am I going to do with you?
Boy!
Just cherish me.
You have an opportunity to be the richest woman in the world...... and I' m going to be your partner.
I' il tell you where the fortune is:
Running shoes...... tennis and jogging shoes, all that kind of stuff.
I mean, I' m talking $50, $100, $200 a pair.
- Wait, you got to be kidding.
You' re talking about exercise stuff?
Like gym stuff?
Not your style.
These are the choices, okay?
Microwave ovens, pocket calculators...... Walkmans, digital watches...... and miniature television sets.
And huge radios.
For some reason everything else gets tiny, but portable radios get enormous.
Huge, enormous radios?
- Portable enormous radios.
- Wait a minute, I got an idea.
Come on!
- What?
- Come on!
Come here!
Here.
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes.
- Do you have pantyhose?
- I' m sorry, what?
Pantyhose.
You know...
"Pantyhose"?
Why, Richard!
This is lingerie.
Mrs. Woodhouse, I am studying the fabric for the aerodynamic principles for kites.
They don' t have it!
They' ve never heard of it.
Isn' t it wonderful?
- What?
- I' m talking about the wave of the future.
I' ve decided on our first fortune.
- I' il see you later.
You just keep thinking high tech.
"High tech"?
That' s nice.
I like the sound of that.
High tech.
- All right, what is the scoop?
- What?
How come we' re your friends and we find out about...... you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Delores?
Who needs satellites when I' ve got Delores' mouth?
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
That' s disgusting!
Maddy, would you grow up?
It says in Love Without Fear the tongue kiss is a means...... of genital stimulation, is widely practised and has much to commend it!
Did you memorise the book or just the good parts?
No.
Just what you underlined.
You did!
You know, Carol, you have great hair.
Peggy Sue, come on!
What' s with you and Michael?
Yeah, come on!
He' s so cool and mysterious.
Well, he' s interesting.
Underneath that rough exterior lurks the heart of a true poet.
A poet?
I bet Delores told Charlie!
- That loudmouthed little bitch!
- Peggy Sue!
Watch out for her, Peggy Sue.
She' s after Charlie.
Just cool it, girls.
Charlie' s free to go out with whoever he wants to.
What?
But I always thought you were going to marry Charlie.
Carol would marry Walter and I' d marry Arthur.
We' d all live on the same street and...... take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday.
It' s going to spoil everything if you and Charlie break up.
That Michael Fitzsimmons doesn' t look like the barbecue type.
I just had one date with him.
I' m not going to marry him!
You promise?
Come on, let' s go to the movies.
Peggy Sue, I mean, don' t be silly.
It' s date night.
I got to go.
Arthur' s picking me up soon.
Wait a minute.
No, I mean just the girls.
Like a slumber party.
- Aren' t we too old for that?
- Sometimes you' re so immature.
Well, we...
'Bye!
I' m immature?
Charlie?
Charlie, I had such a dream.
Peggy Sue, I have to talk to you.
Charlie, what are you doing here?
Let' s go down to the basement.
Okay.
I want to know what' s going on.
Delores told me about you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons.
When you dropped me off last night I didn' t feel like going to bed.
- And I ran into Michael and went for a ride.
- Then it' s true, damn it!
I had a miserable time tonight because of you.
When the Monotones did Book of Love:
I' m thinking, "Did we break up?"
Did we break up?
Because if we did I don' t even know about it.
Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
You know, I hate your sarcasm.
You' re going to blow it, Peggy Sue.
No one treats Charlie Bodell like this.
Why do you talk about yourself in the third person like you were Napoleon?
- Why is everything an argument with you?
I' ve got the hair.
I' ve got the teeth.
I' ve got the eyes.
Peggy, look outside that window.
I' ve got the car.
I' m the lead singer.
I' m the man.
Why are you arguing with me?
It' s over, Charlie.
I don' t want to hurt you.
I want you to be happy.
But, no.
I will be happy if I have you.
I love you.
That doesn' t make any difference.
We just can' t live together.
And you went off with that bimbo Janet.
What are you talking about?
Who is Janet?
- I don' t know any Janet.
- I just can' t trust you!
But what about everything I said to you this afternoon?
That' s exactly what I' m talking about.
I have this window in my heart and anytime you want, you can crawl in.
I got to close it or nothing' s going to be different.
- What has to be different?
- Everything!
You know it' s not going to work like this.
You have to go to college and finish.
What about the group and my singing career?
What about me?
I am trying to save you years of frustration of waiting for...... that big break.
That big disappointment so you can blame me for the rest of your life.
You don' t know zip.
You think I' m going to spend the rest of my life selling appliances?
Chasing women around the store like my father?
I' ve got to give it a shot.
What the hell has changed, Peggy Sue?
Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.
For two years, I' ve done nothing but love you.
All right, I' il prove it to you.
I' il show you.
I' m going to be just like Fabian.
Let' s sit there.
Sure.
This is great.
Okay, here we go.
- Suds for you.
- Thank you.
And a whiskey for you.
Five more weeks of school.
Ten minutes past graduation, I' m gone!
To freedom!
For everyone.
Now, this is the plan.
As soon as school is finished, we move to Utah.
Utah?
I thought you' d be going to Paris or New York.
What' s in Utah?
She' s cool.
You' il really dig her.
She' s got this little cabin outside the hills of Provo where she raises chickens.
I' il write, and you two can take care of the chickens to support us.
- I can' t do that.
- Why not?
Polygamy' s legal in Utah.
I' m allergic to chickens.
What about the other night?
We were like two stars in the same constellation.
Michael, you and I are light- years apart.
You should go, but not with me.
But we had heat, baby.
Passion!
Fire!
We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.
At least one more time.
That' s a great line.
You are going to be a terrific writer.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
Michael, we had one glorious night together.
Someday you' il remember and write about it.
Yeah.
I can dig that.
Bittersweet perfection.
Dogs of lust on leashes of memory.
It' s Charlie.
What a treat.
Now I get it.
It' s great.
Peggy Sue' s still stuck on "Treble Without a Cause."
Come on, I want to dance.
I thought I knew everything about him.
Can we split now?
Thank you.
So, Mr. Wilkins, new client?
I' m sorry, Charlie.
I don' t think so, you know.
It happens, but not with you.
Believe me when I tell you.
Maybe it' s the material.
But it can' t happen.
Good morning.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
I' ve got one last thing I have to do at school and then...
Hi.
How are you?
Hi, guy.
Elvis is dead.
That' s Ajax.
I guess I always liked Elvis.
- Can I have a ride to school?
- No.
- Why?
- The tiger' s out of commission for a while.
Come on.
- How about a walk, Charlie Bell?
- How did you know about that?
I was at Lena' s last night.
I heard you sing.
I thought you were terrific.
Not terrific enough.
What were you doing there?
- Who were you with?
- Well, what were you doing there?
You never told me you sang with an R & B group.
There' s not a whole heck of a lot we know about each other, Peggy.
- I forgot how much music meant to you.
- That' s real big of you.
Stop being so defensive.
Here.
I wrote a song for you.
- Why did you write me a song?
- Because I want to help you.
- It' il be a hit.
- Come on!
Stop being sarcastic.
Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night.
He told me to forget it.
Would you just take a look at it?
I wrote it for you.
Well, if you wrote it I guess I' il look at it.
Listen, about the other night, I feel so stupid.
I' m beginning to think that maybe there is more to life than just music.
Do you think the world would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Yeah.
Do you want to walk to school?
Okay, I' il just put the dog inside.
Come on, Ajax.
What' s the matter, princess?
Lost your prince?
Delores, there are a lot of things I could say to you...... but you' re just not worth the effort.
- I' m so sorry.
These pens are so tricky, I...
- You did that on purpose!
I hate you!
Go stuff your bra!
- I beg your pardon?
- Take a long walk on a short pier.
Have a nice day.
You know, Peggy, there are so many things to look forward to in the future.
I came to say good- bye, Richard.
Good- bye?
Wait a minute.
Sit down.
Good- bye?
Where are you going?
Peggy, we have a partnership here.
- I' m making progress on that microchip.
- Well, you were meant to.
You' re one of the people good things happen to.
So are you.
- You have a vision, Peggy.
- A vision?
I am a walking anachronism!
I' ve upset my parents.
I miss my kids.
I could be trapped here forever.
And poor Charlie.
I got pregnant when I was 18.
That was why we had to get married.
Tomorrow' s my birthday.
- I have to get out of here.
- You broke up with Charlie?
Yeah.
I know it' s a gamble.
I' ve loved him for a long, long time.
Then let' s do something really visionary.
Change your destiny, Peggy Sue.
Change your destiny and marry me.
No!
Peggy Sue got married.
Case closed.
I don' t want to marry anyone, Richard.
Good- bye.
Wait!
Peggy, please.
Can I go with you?
No!
You have to be valedictorian.
Peggy Sue, wait a minute!
Listen, I cut shop and I did some work on your song.
You know, it' s not half bad for your first try.
I changed all the "yeahs" to "oohs," but listen to this:
I got to go.
About your birthday.
I made reservations at Chez Trev.
I thought it would be great to eat at a nice restaurant.
I won' t be here.
- Why?
- I want to go see my grandparents.
Good- bye, Charlie.
I cancelled the tickets for Fabian.
Close that.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Look!
Oh, it' s so beautiful.
What' s the matter, Peggy?
Someone jump on your grave?
You know, Peggy, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
I wish she hadn' t have told you that.
I' m not afraid.
I know exactly when I' m going to die.
What' s it going to be, Lizzy?
Seventy- five or eighty?
I' m not telling!
I' ve been trying to drag that out of her for years.
You know, dreams are a fascinating business.
- Especially when you see the future.
- Do you believe all this?
Well, I like to speculate.
Like this book I' m reading right now.
It' s about a woman in Colorado who says she lived in Ireland 150 years ago.
She gives names, dates and where she lived.
Grandma.
Grandpa.
I want to tell you something.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe.
Being young is just as confusing as being old.
The things that happened to me 50 years ago...... are more on my mind than the things that happen today.
But I' m remembering the future.
A chilling wind tonight.
It' s really picking up.
Right now, you' re just browsing through time.
Choose the things you' il be proud of.
Things that last.
I' m proud of my children.
I miss them so much.
Scott and Beth.
I named my daughter after you.
Sweetheart, thank you.
Grandpa.
When you and Grandma are gone, the family' s gone.
And I' il never see the cousins anymore.
It' s your grandma' s strudel that' s kept this family together.
If you could do it all again, Grandpa, what would you do different?
I' d have taken better care of my teeth.
Now what' s Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
It' s her 18th birthday and I want to show her off.
It was my idea, Grandma.
I wondered about those lodge meetings.
He won' t tell me.
But I have my suspicions.
I don' t want to know.
Have a good time, darling.
All right.
- Good- bye.
- Good- bye, darling.
Grandpa?
What does Grandma think you do at these meetings?
Stag movies and poker.
I may be an old fool, but I think I can help you.
At least I got to see you and Grandma again.
Has this ever worked before?
The last time was 600 years ago.
And it' s about time for another one.
Welcome, Peggy Sue!
Peggy Sue!
Welcome, Peggy Sue!
- It' s so wonderful to have you here with us.
You' ve come to the right place.
Our lodge was founded by a time traveller.
- We' re going to send you back home.
- That' s right!
You know, this is very exciting for all of us.
You know, we' ve waited a long time to find a girl like you.
Yes!
Grandpa!
Do you have to wear that hat?
Wouldn' t be a lodge without hats.
"Lord of the universe.
"Vast and mighty one.
"Ruler of light.
"King of the sun.
"This girl is lost amid your mysteries...
"... and wishes to return to her own time.
"We adore thee and invoke thee!
"Grant thine aid.
"Look with favour upon us as we witness the regeneration of spirit.
"We ask thy intervention...
"... that this girl may return to thee on the wings of thy love."
"Womb of the mother, reclaim thy child of light."
"The name of your love is rebirth."
- This is never going to work.
- It' s going to work!
"Reclaim thy child of light."
"We offer up this girl that her soul may find its home."
It' s nothing to worry about.
Somebody get the lights.
Somebody get the lights!
She' s gone!
What the hell do you think you' re doing?
I' m saving you!
They were going to vaporise you!
Don' t be ridiculous!
They' re harmless old men!
My grandfather was in there!
- Get in the car!
- I' m not getting in this monstrosity!
Well, the girl' s gone.
Let' s play cards.
I' ve got good news.
Now sit down right here.
You' ve got two minutes!
I told my father that I' m going to quit singing.
And he gave me 10 percent of the business right now!
- What are you talking about?
- I know what you' ve been going through.
You were just scared.
But you don' t have to be scared anymore.
I can support you now.
- Shit!
- Peggy Sue?
Will you marry me?
How can you know what I' ve been going through?
Of course I' m scared!
I can' t change anything.
- I can' t help anybody.
- You' re not listening to me.
- I' m proposing to you now.
- You betrayed me.
You were never there for me and the children.
I' il be there for the children.
I' il forget Walter.
Forget the group.
I want to marry you!
Don' t be crazy.
I may be crazy, but I' m not crazy enough to marry you twice.
Christ.
I' m sorry.
I thought I was what you wanted me to be.
It' s all my fault.
Here.
It' s a birthday present.
I' m tired of being the romantic fool.
I' m going to go save my car.
It opens, too.
Look inside.
Scott and Beth.
Where did you get this?
Who are Scott and Beth?
Your mother gave me those.
It' s you and me.
You know that.
So are they.
I do love you.
I love you.
This is right, Peggy Sue.
I want this to be forever.
Mom, can you hear me?
Please, Mom, can you hear me?
They call what happened a near- death...... but we figured out exactly what the problem is...
You are a very lucky young lady!
What happened to you, Peggy Sue, was a very rare problem...... with the rhythm of your heart.
Mom, do you remember anything?
In fact, at the party, they had to do CPR on you...... before the paramedics arrived to give your heart a shock and restart it.
Dad' s been here every day. "'Cause I love you, Peggy Sue
"I love you, girl, and I need you, Peggy"
- Was I dead?
- I thought you were for a while.
You look awful.
You look like you haven' t slept in days.
- You look so old.
- But happy.
Very happy, Peggy.
I thought I knew everything about you.
I wanted to tell you that I...
- I wanted to...
- I' m sorry.
I can' t live without you.
What about Janet?
That' s over.
I got tired of translating everything to her.
She thought the Big Bopper was a hamburger.
- Who are all the flowers from?
- Everyone.
Maddy and Arthur, Carol and Walter...... Richard Norvik.
And here' s a book by that guy in high school, Michael Fitzsimmons.
He dedicated it to you.
It couldn' t be me.
I hardly knew him.
I' il just set this right here.
I had a strange experience.
I went back to high school and I spent a lot of time with you.
You and Walter and Leon were singing I Wonder Why.
God!
Dion!
You were terrific.
And I kept trying to push you away.
- But you wouldn' t give up.
- I' il never give up.
Would you hold me?
I don' t expect that all our problems can just vanish.
Christ, I would cut my right arm off for another chance.
No, please, I need some time.
Well, I' il let you get some rest.
I' d like to invite you over to our house for dinner on Sunday.
With your kids.
I' il make a strudel.
Excuse me, miss.
There seems to be a mistake.
I ordered the large cappuccino.
Hello!
- Look at the size of this.
- It' s a bowl.
It' s like Campbell' s cup- o- ccino.
Please.
Aidez- moi.
So Tony...... what' s with your clothes?
What?
You look like you' re in Starsky and Hutch.
- I look hip.
- No, no, no.
More like an undercover cop trying to be.
- I am a cop trying to look hip.
- Can you do me a favour?
When you go to my parents' don' t dress like a 1 970s pimp.
My parents are a little eccentric.
This poem is called, "An Apology To The Aliens Who Abducted Me...... and Whom I lnflicted Destruction Upon...... While Having a Panic Attack Aboard the Ship."
Autobiographical.
- What are you gonna do tonight?
- Well...... l' m gonna do a poem about Sherri.
- Yeah.
Why did you break up with Sherri?
Tony, I told you already, she' s a thief.
- You don' t honestly believe that?
- Tony, she' s a klepto.
To this day I still don' t know where my cat is.
Charlie, every time you meet a nice girl...
-... you get paranoid and break up.
- That' s not true.
- I broke up for good reasons.
- Really?
- Yes.
- What about Jill?
She was in the Mafia.
- She was in the Mafia?
- Yes, the Cosa Nostra.
- I never knew how she made a living.
- She was unemployed.
- She didn' t work.
- That' s a perfect cover.
All right.
What about Pam?
She smelled like soup.
- What does that mean?
- Like beef- vegetable soup.
- Paranoid.
- You weren' t there.
It' s all in your head.
It is.
- I' m up.
Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
Ladies and gentlemen, let' s hear it for our own Mr. Charlie MacKenzie.
Woman
Woe man
Whoa man
She was a thief You gotta believe
She stole my heart and my cat
Betty
Josie and those hot Pussycats
They make me horny Saturday morny
Girls of cartoons Won' t leave me in ruins
I want to be Betty' s Barney
Hey, Jane, get me off This crazy thing...... called love
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can I help you?
- Yes, do you have haggis?
- Yes, we do.
One?
Yes, please.
My parents are Scottish.
That will be $1 9. 75.
Here you go.
Thank you.
- Will there be anything else?
- No, thanks.
Thanks.
May, get in here!
All right, May, turn off the Bay City rollers!
The soccer game' s about to begin!
- Hello.
- Hi!
We' re in here, son!
- Charlie.
- How' s it going, William?
Give your mother a kiss, or I' il kick your teeth in.
Hi.
Hey!
May.
Shut it!
- How you doing, Dad?
- Come on, Charlie.
- Away you go with your mother.
Why don' t you try one of her bras on, wee girl?
Flaunt away, you fairy!
Hey, Mom.
I brought you guys a haggis.
That' s sweet of you, son.
Thank you.
I haven' t seen one of these for years.
But your father will --
Look.
He' s giving Tony all that Lyndon H. LaRouche rubbish again.
It' s a known fact, Sonny Jim, that a secret society...... of the five wealthiest people, known as the Pentavirate...... run everything in the world, including the newspapers...... and meet tri- annually at a secret mansion in Colorado known as...
-... "The Meadows."
- Who' s in the Pentavirate?
The Queen, the Vatican, the Gettys, the Rothschilds...... and Colonel Sanders, before he went tits- up.
I hated the Colonel, with his wee beady eyes...... and that smug look on his face.
Oh! "
Dad, how can you hate the Colonel?
He puts addictive chemicals in chicken...... making you crave it fortnightly, smart- ass!
Interesting.
Cuckoo.
Charlie, would you like a juice?
Look at what I' ve bought myself, a Juice Tiger.
- A Juice Tiger?
- Yes, I juice everything now.
I' m on a new diet.
I' m on a Weekly World News Garth Brooks Juice Diet.
Scores!
- Margin, one- nil!
- Magic goal!
Let' s have a look at the replay.
William, move your head.
Look at the size of that boy' s head.
It' s like an orange on a toothpick.
- You' il give him a complex.
- That' s a huge noggin.
It' s a virtual planetoid.
Has its own weather system!
Head!
Move!
- Your Sherri' s late.
- Mom...... Sherri and I broke up.
Not Sherri?
I liked Sherri.
I didn' t like the other girls you brought home.
- Don' t make it any harder for me.
- Why should I make it easier, son?
You were good together, you and Sherri.
- I thought you' d marry.
- You know I' m terrified of marriage.
I know that.
Did you read the paper?
- No.
- No?
Where did I put it?
Stuart!
Bring in the paper!
All right, hon!
Head!
Paper!
Now!
Hauling that gargantuan cranium about.
Spherical, but pointy in parts.
That was offside, wasn' t it?
He' il be crying himself to sleep tonight on his huge pillow.
Mom, why do you refer to Weekly World News...... as "the paper"?
The paper contains facts.
This paper contains facts.
And this paper has the eighth- highest circulation in the whole wide world.
Plenty of facts. "Pregnant Man Gives Birth."
That' s a fact.
Here it is, look.
Read this. "Mrs. X. The honeymoon murderer."
She marries men under fake identities and then she murders them.
She' s murdered three men already.
Victim number one was a lounge singer.
Victim number two, a Russian martial arts expert.
And she' s also killed a plumber named Ralph Elliot.
And her whereabouts are unknown.
Good night.
You know that?
Thanks, Mrs. MacKenzie.
- Hasn' t he?
- I think so.
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, Charlie.
- Good night, Dad.
You' ve stayed your hour.
Ooh, yes.
- Morning, Charles.
- Morning, sir.
Are you working on the forms for the vendor --?
Yes, captain.
Tony?
Tony?
I don' t want to intrude, but you seem a little down.
Well, captain, it' s about my job.
I' m having doubts about being a cop.
It' s not like how it is on TV.
I fill out forms and paperwork all day.
Point well taken, but even though it' s not exciting...... it' s very important.
Yeah, but of all my times as a cop, I' ve never....
I never chased a guy across a crowded square.
I' ve never hung onto that part of the helicopter.
You know that part?
- You know?
- I know it.
I' ve never hung onto that or even commandeered a vehicle.
- That sounds like a lot of fun.
- That' s the other thing.
You' re too nice.
- I' m too nice?
- Yes, you' re too nice.
Why not be like a Starsky and Hutch captain?
Where you haul me in your office and bawl me out...... because you' re tired of defending me from the commissioner.
Some are appointed, elected, or co- opted biannually.
- It' s a quorum, so to speak.
- A quorum?
I thought I was gonna be Serpico...... but instead I' m like Fish from Barney Miller.
Hey, somebody needs a hug.
Captain.
Okay, coming up.
- Hi.
- Haggis, right?
Yeah, I' m the guy who ordered the haggis.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
- Do you like haggis?
- No, it' s repellent.
I think Scottish cuisine is based on a dare.
- I' m next.
- You' re next.
Yes, can I help you?
That' s all.
No more, no less.
- Get it and let me out.
Be right back.
- It' s busy, hey?
- It' s insane today.
My dad' s a butcher, and I used to work at his shop.
- I can help you.
- I' d love some help.
- Great, what' s your name?
- Charlie.
- Harriet.
- Hi, Harriet.
- Could you get four porterhouses?
- Okay.
Just kidding.
Hi.
So do you live in New York?
Really?
You guide me.
You guide me.
Mom, can you get the school nurse?
Get the school nurse!
Help me!
It was an accident in shop.
Get me a tourniquet?
Anything.
Thanks for helping me out at the butcher shop.
- You were really nice.
- Oh, I was nice? "Nice." Evidently you think of me as a woman friend.
- And what is wrong with being nice?
- Nothing.
- Charlie?
- Yes?
- Name a bad thing you' ve done.
- I' ve done bad things.
Tell me one bad thing you' ve done, and it better be evil.
- How evil?
- Really evil.
So evil that you would say it was "e- vil."
Like it' s "the fruits of the De- vil." "E- vil."
For example, how many people have you brutally murdered?
"Brutal" is a very subjective word.
What' s brutal to one person might be reasonable to somebody else.
Do you know Russian?
Yeah.
Oh, this hurts.
No, this is hard.
Not only are you extremely good- looking...... but you' re also very smart and that' s no fair.
- That' s hard.
- Bright women intimidate you?
Not at all.
But it' s a shame I' m going to have to destroy you.
- Charlie, come here!
- Nadia...... l am coming.
Expand, contract, expand.
What do you look for in a woman you date?
I know everyone always says sense of humour...... but I have to go with breast size.
Oh, my God.
Let us dance like children of the night.
- Here we are.
What a great place.
- Some tea?
- Sure.
Well, show yourself around.
You know what this place needs?
A large poster of Atlantic City.
Oh, look, you got one!
I used to live there.
I have herbal teas:
Cubby Wubby Womb Room tea...
-... and Morning Thunder.
- I' il go with Cubby Wubby.
All right, thanks.
What' s this?
Oh!
I had a friend who was a martial arts expert and....
- Oh, you had a friend?
- It' s a martial arts thing.
I thought it would look good on the wall.
It does.
You know, Scotland has its own martial arts.
It' s called "Fuck You!"
It' s mostly head- butting and kicking people on the ground.
- It' s late.
- Not for me.
- Who for, then?
- Who for, then, what?
If not for you, I wonder who it is late for.
Not me, no.
I like the nightlife.
I like to boogie.
I' il make the tea, then.
You know...
... maybe it is late.
I had a great time tonight...... and I' d really love to kiss you.
But if I kiss you, we' il end up on the couch, and if we end up there...... chances are we' il kiss in the bedroom...... and that' s the part I always rush into.
It' s not a good idea to rush into spending the night together.
I want to.
I have no problem with that.
You' re it.
Come here!
Oh, God!
Yes.
Yes.
Ralph!
I will.
Not now!
Ralph!
Ralph!
Harriet.
You were having a dream.
And you kept saying the name "Ralph."
- Ralph?
- Yeah, you kept saying "Ralph."
She' s my friend.
She' s your friend.
Ralph.
"She" is your friend.
Ralph.
Ralph.
She.
I' m sorry!
I thought you were somebody else!
Hi.
Hi.
I' m Harriet' s friend, Charlie.
You must be Ralph?
I' m Harriet' s sister, Rose.
- She gave me a note to give to you.
- Great. "Dear Charlie, I didn' t want to wake you.
Make yourself at home and thanks for the...... hot dog.
That' s a very nice note.
- Let me make you some breakfast.
- I' d love to, but I' m running late.
How do silver- dollar pancakes...... fresh orange juice, bacon and Kona coffee sound?
It sounds great.
I didn' t have those other things.
That' s fine.
That other stuff will kill you.
Whereas Froot Loops are light and reasonably high in fibre.
- I care for Apple Jacks a great deal.
- Got them.
Good.
So, is this your place?
No, this is our place.
Harriet' s and mine.
She sort of comes and goes but always ends up here.
She didn' t speak of me?
No, she didn' t "speak of you."
She mentioned a martial arts guy, and there was discussion about Ralph?
Oh, really?
She spoke about them?
She talked about the martial arts guy and kind of shouted Ralph.
- Well, you know Harriet.
- Actually, I don' t.
- But you did have sex with her.
- Hello!
I' m gonna go now.
I won' t tell Harriet that anything happened.
Nothing did happen.
Don' t worry, Charlie.
Just be careful.
"Just be careful."
I had the greatest night of my life last night.
- Sounds like you really like her.
I' m in deep smit.
She is wonderful.
But we shouldn' t talk about it.
I' il start analysing it, and that' s no good.
Relax.
I am a park ranger, and I will lead you on the tour.
All the rangers at Alcatraz were once guards, myself included.
My name is John Johnson, but everyone calls me Vickie.
Please follow me.
He' s great.
- He' s the best.
This is the main cellblock area.
Home to such famous criminals as AI Capone...... Mickey Cohen, Joseph "Dutch" Cretzer...... and Robert Stroud, the famous Birdman of Alcatraz.
If something happens, I' il let it go.
It' s not my business.
For example, "Ralph."
She says "Ralph" in her sleep.
So what?
Ralph?
This cell' s for solitary confinement...... that' s come to be known as "Times Square."
Make sure everyone gets a look.
So who' s Ralph?
I don' t know.
More importantly, I don' t want to know.
That' s good.
Did you and Harriet, you know, last night?
Okay, dirtbag.
All you have to know is that Harriet' s a sweet and loving person.
That' s nice.
- And yes, we did.
- All right!
Close it up, close it up, close it up.
This is something the other tour guides won' t tell you.
In this cellblock, Machine Gun Kelly...... had what we call in the prison system, a "bitch."
One night, in a jealous rage, Kelly took a makeshift knife, or "shiv"...... and cut out the bitch' s eyes.
- Another thing about Harriet I love -- - No, no.
And as if this wasn' t enough retribution for Kelly...... the next day he and four other inmates took turns pissing...... into the bitch' s ocular cavities.
This way to the cafeteria.
Tony, I' m really happy.
Please, don' t let me screw this one up.
- I' il try.
- Alrighty.
- That ocular cavity thing was -- - When he mentioned pissing into....
Okay, I got another one.
What' s worse?
The cable goes out and you' re left with synchronized swimming...... or --
Okay.
You' re stuck on the Bay Bridge in traffic...... and you' ve just had two strong cups of coffee and three bran muffins.
I have a good one.
- Hello!
Hello!
What' s worse?
You go to your favourite restaurant...... order your favourite meal, take a bite...... and under the steak is a scabby Band- Aid.
Or....
Or being electrocuted.
And?
I was electrocuted once.
It was horrible.
- Oh, well, that' s....
- That' s a crying shame.
Can we get our check, please?
Thanks a lot.
Electrocuted.
That was funny.
- I' il get that.
- No, I got it.
Charlie.
No, no, no.
I insist.
- No, no, no. - "No" infinity.
- Come on.
- Negatory, good buddy.
- You' re embarrassing me.
- I' il pick up the check.
- Okay.
You want to catch a cab?
- I' d like to walk.
- Come on, it' s raining.
- I' d like to walk.
- Me too.
- All right.
See you later.
Nice meeting you.
- Well, it' s officially raining.
- It' s just a drizzle.
You know, I love that you wanted to walk in the rain.
I' m glad you' re meeting my parents tomorrow.
You know what, Charlie?
It' s strange, but I feel really safe with you.
Like in old movies when people never left each other.
I mean, they stayed together forever.
It' s a great house.
They moved in the day they were married.
I' m throwing them a 30th wedding anniversary party.
Mom, Dad, we' re here.
Stuart!
Charlie!
Is this the wee Harriet?
She' s absolutely beautiful.
And you' re very, very welcome.
I hope you hold on to this one.
You have the face of a wee angel, do you know that?
I give!
I' m Charlie' s father.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
I like this one, Charlie.
She' s quite a filly.
Charlie tells me you' re a butcher.
Yes, I am a butcher.
Do you link your own sausage?
I do.
- Why don' t you put your trousers on?
- Hold your horses.
Head!
Pants!
Now!
Why don' t you come with me?
I have wonderful photos of when he was a wee baby.
Like one of him shitting his pants at Niagara Falls.
Come on, don' t show her the pictures.
Lighten up, Charlie.
You' ve got a pickle up your ass again.
I' m going to the washroom, okay?
Evidently, I have a pickle up my ass.
- You' il be okay if I leave you?
Don' t worry about me.
Make sure there' s enough paper.
And Charlie, light a match!
Are you away to crap, again?
What a cute baby Charlie was!
You okay in there?
You didn' t fall in there, did you?
I can' t believe the resemblance between you and Charlie.
Thank you.
That' s enough about us.
Tell me something about yourself.
Have you always lived in San Francisco?
No, actually I moved around quite a bit.
I had a really great time with your family tonight.
Oh, great.
You know that martial arts expert friend you had?
Was that here in San Francisco?
No, actually it was Miami.
Your family' s really great, Charlie.
- When your mother took out -- - Was that before Atlantic City?
It' s a period in my life that I really don' t like talking about.
Charlie.
I hated Atlantic City, Charlie.
It' s a town full of gamblers and lounge singers.
Ralph?
No.
Oh, Ralph.
Mrs. X.
She murders her husbands, then changes her identity and marries again.
I never heard of it.
So what?
I think I' m dating Mrs. X.
Charlie.
Two words.
Therapy.
She told me she dated a martial arts expert.
It says that one of the victims was a martial arts expert.
Last night, she put a move on my dad and tried to break his neck.
About 1 000 people have tried to break his neck.
If they also say "Ralph" in their sleep, it' s a good start.
Look here, "Ralph Elliot.
Plumber from Dallas.
Missing since his honeymoon. "
- Charlie, you' re just getting scared.
- Yes.
- Harriet could be the one.
- Yes.
You suspect her, because you' re scared you' il marry her.
And to you that' s death.
Come on, just read it, okay?
Read it.
For me, just read it?
- "Larry Leonard, the croner..."
- Crooner. "... made a name for himself...... being able to sing, in six languages, 'Only You."'
Does Harriet know the words to "Only You"?
We haven' t reached that critical...... "Do you know the words to 'Only You"' phase.
- So I' m afraid I' m not much help.
- Charlie!
You gotta move past this!
You' re living according to the Weekly World News.
It' s the 8th highest circulating paper in the world, I' il have you know.
Look, Tony, Mrs. X.
Please, look it up, okay?
For me? lndulge me?
There' s no record of deaths.
All three were reported missing, but so were their wives.
No picture of any brides.
For all we know, they just moved away.
That' s true.
You' re gonna have to realize that.
I would lie to you, but Kathy always tells the truth.
Understood.
You feel better now?
- Good, good.
Come on.
I' m Maureen O' Boyle.
Welcome to A Current Affair.
Tonight.:
Amy, did she or didn' t she?
Then, the reptile that took Hollywood by storm.
"Iguana be in pictures."
But first, the Justice Department reports an alarming rise...... in the number of poisoning murders.
And that 87%%% of the murders occur within the family...... a scourge which seems to be reaching into every home.
Steve.
The most common poisonings occur between couples.
For reasons as varied as insurance fraud, jealousy...... and pure psychopathic behaviour.
I have a surprise for you.
What is it?
It' s a health shake.
I made it especially for you.
Try it.
Thank you, no.
Thanks.
You' il like it, Charlie.
Just take a sip.
I have kitten breath.
I' m just gonna go brush my teeth.
Why don' t you just taste it?
It' s got strawberries.
Taste it.
I spent 20 minutes making it.
- One little sip.
It wouldn' t hurt -- - I' m just gonna go.
Fine.
Forget it.
Forget it.
I' m sorry.
That' s okay.
I' m just sensitive.
I mean, you didn' t drink my shake.
So what?
Right?
I understand.
- Let' s scratch.
- It' s depressing.
- Scratch.
- Scratch?
Scratch.
Let' s do a little scratching.
Scratching.
- Golden Gate Bridge.
- Golden.
- Presidio.
Union Square.
- Got it.
- Little Japan.
- Got it.
Union Square.
- Oakland.
Oakland.
- Oakland.
Can you reach around and get Coit Tower?
- San Andreas Fault.
- Charlie.
You know what I like best about you?
I can tell you anything, and you don' t judge me.
Have you ever stood at the edge of a cliff...... or subway platform with someone...... and you thought just for a split second:
What if I pushed him?
I follow the Judeo- Christian ethic of "Thou shalt not kill."
- But that' s just me.
- I' m just making a point...... of how many times we trust people with our lives.
I mean, look at us.
Look how vulnerable we are, sleeping.
I could do anything to you in your sleep.
Like what?
Anything.
You' re on your side, asleep, I could...... stick a needle in your --
Charlie!
Jesus!
I' m showing you we have a good relationship!
I' m sorry, but I have an ear thing.
In an episode of Night Gallery, this guy gets an earwig.
They said the good news is, we got the earwig...... but the bad news is, it was a female.
- I' m sorry.
- Good night.
- I have an ear thing.
- Good night.
I' m sorry.
- Get off.
Just, good night.
Well, good night.
Can I help you?
I' d like to place an announcement.
It' s my parents' 30th anniversary.
That' s $4. 50 per word...... and you' ve got a choice of standard or bold.
You having a busy week, Frank?
No, just these two.
It' s been dead around here.
I got this tourist, heart attack on a cable car.
Guy left his heart in San Francisco.
That' s a real person you' re talking about.
All right, I' m sorry.
Elliot, Ralph.
Disappeared four months ago.
The body was found in a sewer.
Guy takes his job too seriously, life goes down the drain.
Did they mention his wife?
I know that we' re talking about real people here, so I' m sorry.
Seriously, did they mention the wife?
I didn' t mean to joke about other people' s lives.
I' m serious.
Did they mention --?
You win, okay?
I' m a bad person.
- Take it easy.
- No, he' s saying I' m a shit.
Did they mention the wife?
Did they mention the wife!
No!
They didn' t mention the wife!
You happy?
Yes, I' m insensitive!
I' m a very insensitive man!
Look at the insensitive man!
That' s why they pay you!
He was my ride home.
Understood.
Why did you have to see me so urgently?
You couldn' t come to my place?
It' s just safer here.
What?
Charlie.
I' m sorry.
I think you' re a terrific woman.
I just don' t think we should see each other.
Why?
And tell me the truth.
I' m afraid that you' re gonna k -- Leave me.
I' m gonna cleave you?
- What does that mean?
- No, leave me.
That you' il reject me.
So I just thought I' d do a preemptive strike.
So you' re rejecting me?
I didn' t mean to hurt you.
I never wanted to hurt you.
Don' t worry, you haven' t.
At least you left early on.
So that' s it, then?
Because I gotta get back to work.
Woman Woe man
Whoa man
We had love not just sex ls she Mrs. X?
I had to run for my life
Jane, get me off of this crazy thing
Called love
Hello!
Not that it matters, but I thought you' d like to know...... somebody admitted murdering Ralph.
What about the others?
She just confessed to the one.
Gotta go.
Catch you later.
- It' s me, Charlie.
- Go away.
I gotta talk to you.
I' m an idiot.
I' il go into therapy, okay?
I' il go twice a week.
I don' t know if insurance will cover it, but....
What is it?
Hi, Charlie.
I don' t want to lose you.
You didn' t.
You rejected me.
Okay, I' m un- rejecting you.
You' il do it again.
No, I' m not gonna do it again.
Look, I got scared, okay?
Things were going really good and then I just got scared.
I love you.
I love you too.
You blew it.
Harriet, Harriet
Hard- hearted harbinger of haggis
Beautiful, bemuséd
Bellicose butcher
Untrusting
Unknowing
Unlovéd
He wants you back He screams into the night air
Like a fireman going to a window That has no fire
Except the passion of his heart
I am lonely
It' s really hard
This poem sucks
I' m sorry I didn' t trust you.
Harriet, somebody' s downstairs to see you.
She' il be down in a moment.
And could you bring the car around?
Thank you so much.
Bye- bye.
I want you to meet a friend.
This is Ralph.
Ralph?
Ralph?
This is Ralph?
This is Ralph?
This is Charlie.
- Great to meet you.
- No, it' s great to meet you.
Yes, I love you so much.
Oh, God!
I' m naked, aren' t l?
Yes, you are naked.
Very nude.
Nice to meet you and call me?
I will.
Shut it!
I' d like to propose a toast.
To my wife, May.
Thirty years ago today, May and I were married.
Some of you were there.
And some of you are now dead!
But we both said, "I do," and we haven' t agreed on a thing since.
That' s true.
But I' m glad I married you...... because it could have been worse.
And besides...... l still love you.
Thank you.
Tony, would you like to dance?
Let' s dance.
It must be a great feeling to have....
You okay?
No, I' m not.
Marry me.
No.
Please?
Why not just live together?
Let' s just live together.
Because I love you.
We should get married...... and spend the next 30 years of our life together.
I want you to have my children.
And I want you to have your children.
I love you.
I need you.
Let' s just get married.
Okay?
Harriet...... be my wife.
All right, everyone, shut your cake hole!
I' d like to make a toast to my son, Charlie.
Thanks for throwing this great party.
I hope you have the same great 30 years that we' ve had.
To Charlie!
Yes.
You will?
Let' s get married, Charlie.
Now, Mr. MacKenzie, if you will take this woman to be your wife...... through thick and thin, for better or for worse...... please say "I do."
I do.
Now, Harriet, if you will take this man through good times and bad...... forever and ever as your husband, please say "I do."
I do.
Now, Charlie, kiss the beautiful bride.
Let' s get pissed!
Hang a solo!
We have a piper who' s down.
It' s all right, he' s just pissed.
We have a piper down.
I repeat, a piper is down.
This is such a great party.
- It is.
- The marriage was beautiful.
- It was.
- It was great.
Yeah.
She' s great, isn' t she?
She' s the best.
She' s incredible.
You' ve been such a chicken, and finally, you met the one.
How could you think she was a killer?
Come here, Charlie.
Come stand by me, Charlie.
Wait till you see this place.
It' s called Poets' Corner.
A lot of the Beat poets used to go there.
You' re really quiet.
Oh, I' m just thinking.
Oh, okay.
Well....
Why don' t I do the talking for you, all right?
Hi, my name is Harriet.
Hi, Harriet.
How' s it going?
Good, good, I suppose.
I think you' re great, Charlie.
Everything you do is art.
You' re a sex machine.
Get on the scene with the sex machine.
You' re the best husband I ever had --
Why did you just say that?
It was a joke.
Why did you say it?
I thought it might be funny.
That' s all.
What?
- You' re the best.
Watch out!
I hear you' ve been working the Ralph Elliot case.
- Yes, captain.
- Don' t "yes" me.
This is strictly homicide.
I got a friend --
We all got these friends.
I' m warning you.
Back off, ltalian boy.
It' s too big.
Wait a minute.
I know what I' m talking about.
What' s the news?
Here' s the news.
The lady that confessed to Elliot' s murder has...... confessed to other crimes.
I knew she would.
To the murders of Abraham Lincoln...... Warren G. Harding, and Julius Caesar.
Oh, my God!
I gotta go.
Screw this up, and you' il be writing parking tickets forever.
Captain, I won' t let you down.
Good for you.
That was better.
- Yeah?
- It was fantastic.
- The beginning felt good.
- It was great.
Too much in the end.
No, it was terrific.
- I need to save a life.
- I' il work on it.
Work on it, it was terrific.
It was a big improvement.
Thanks.
That is Ralph Elliot' s wife.
Of course her hair was much shorter then.
She' s gained weight since then...... but it' s definitely her.
He was really in love with her...... but I tell you, she was fun, and smart.
Doll- face too.
Thank you very much.
This is really cool.
Hi.
Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie, enjoy your honeymoon.
When you leave, it' il be far too soon.
That' s great.
Four nights.
Your dinner reservations are at 9: 00.
Sounds great.
Put candles by the bed.
With a storm, we lose power.
Did you hear that?
A storm.
We' il be snugly inside and....
You okay?
I have a headache.
Excuse me, do you have a drugstore?
- I need aspirin.
- Up the stairs, Mrs. MacKenzie.
Don' t move.
- You think she has a headache?
- What?
Nothing.
Here' s your key.
The Robbie Burns room.
Thank you.
- The circuits are down.
- Keep on trying.
Tell the chief I chartered a plane.
- Hey, paisan!
- What?
Screw up, I' il kick your spaghetti butt back to Milan.
Not now.
- Too many ethnic slurs?
- It' s not paisan, it' s paisan.
Hey!
Paisan.
How long is it gonna take us to get there?
It shouldn' t take very long.
Actually, I have no concept of time.
Jesus, is this dangerous?
Well, there' s chance in everything.
You' ve done this before, right?
I do this all the time.
I' ve never done it at night.
Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie, glad to see you.
Follow me.
How do you know where you' re going?
Instruments.
Oh, yeah?
What' s that?
That' s the artificial horizon, which is better than the actual horizon.
You know, I' m gonna wash my hands.
I love you.
Good evening.
Wake up!
Oh, man, I was having an amazing dream.
I don' t care about your dream!
Land the plane!
I was just born, and I was eight- and- a- half months premature.
- The doctors were freaking out.
- Shut up.
Did I already tell you this dream?
I have a few announcements.
Celebrating their 25th anniversary tonight...... Mr. and Mrs. Seymour Levenstein.
How about a hand for them?
Thank you, thank you.
Twenty- five years ago, they were here.
Speaking of new couples, Charlie and Harriet MacKenzie.
- They look great.
- There' s a phone call for you.
It is quite urgent.
Sorry.
Hello.
- Charlie, you okay?
- Couldn' t be better.
Charlie, listen to me.
Harriet is Mrs. X.
She killed those men.
I got a picture.
It' s her, Charlie.
She' s the murderer.
It' il take a while.
Just stay where you are.
Charlie?
Hold on one second.
What should I do?
When the time comes, you' il know.
Thanks, thank you.
Hello, hello, hello?!
Charlie?
Charlie?!
- Hello!
- What happened?
I was talking, and it died.
It' s common.
It will be out until tomorrow.
What happened?
Nothing.
The phone lines went dead.
We want to play The Platters, "Only You."
You have to wait for the wedding dance.
We got a lot of traditions here.
I' m with the San Francisco Police Department.
I need to commandeer this vehicle.
No.
What do you mean, "No"?
I know you don' t have the right to commandeer my vehicle.
Please, can I commandeer this vehicle?
No.
You' re not gonna bend on this thing, are you?
No.
- Please.
- Go ahead.
No, I don' t want to.
Charlie.
Who I want --
They' ve had enough of this crowd.
They have better things to do.
Let' s put them in the honeymoon chair.
- We did it on our honeymoon.
- It' s just fun.
No, I haven' t had my dessert yet.
To the room!
To the room!
Have a good night.
Stay for a nightcap?
You two want to be alone.
Stay for a nightcap.
I really shouldn' t.
Stay for a nightcap!
Charlie, there' s something I' ve been meaning to tell you.
Harriet, I, l....
Charlie, I' ve been married before.
- Harriet, I already know that.
- You know about my husbands?
- Stay away from me!
- What are you doing?
Come on.
Stay away from me.
You don' t understand.
Give me the axe!
- Don' t go!
- Get off me!
- Charlie!
Don' t go!
- Get off!
Would you mind not doing that?
This bothers you?
No, it' s one of my favourite things.
Don' t go!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Hello?
Hello?!
I just can' t handle the commitment.
It' s too hard.
I' m leaving you.
Love, Charlie "?
I didn' t write this.
What the fuck?!
Rose!
What' s happening?!
Charlie, open the door!
- Rose tried to kill me.
- What?
I wrote this note!
You' re not to be here when...... this note has been placed on the desk!
Do you understand me?
You took her away from me, Charlie.
Like all the rest.
I have had it!
You are going to die.
Would you mind waiting?
I may need you to help if I make an arrest.
I' il need a ride --
Shucks.
Thank you.
What are you doing?!
Charlie, be careful.
Run, Charlie!
Stop this, Rose!
Help!
Help!
Charlie!
Help!
Hurry.
Who is it?!
Help!
Who' s there?!
Charlie?!
Come here.
Tony!
Open the closet.
Charlie!
Where are you going?
We gotta go on the roof.
Charlie and Rose are on the roof.
Charlie' s on the roof!
- What' re you doing?
Let' s just take this down a notch.
What you' re saying is that Rose killed your husbands...... forged notes to make you think they left?
Yes.
Listen!
You don' t get it, do you?
We can talk here, or we can talk about it downtown.
- Charlie, I' m coming up!
- Hang on!
Charlie.
Charlie, be careful!
Rose!
San Francisco police!
I got her!
Don' t let me fall!
Oh, sorry.
rose, jailbird

You can always send me to the place no- one likes to go.
Dr Vlach and I meet in the coffee- house every Sunday.
Last week I hired a man- servant.
His name is Saturnin.
My life is now filled with new experiences and surprises.
For me, life was something of a slippery slope.
I could maintain a cool head but not my balance nor my derriere.
You´d be a good target, but no- one here would be capable of such originality.
- You mean harpooning whales?
- I like your sense of humour.
Coffee, coffee, soda water, soda water, ashtray!
Humanity can be divided according to the ´´café- man- doughnuts´´ theory.
The first man in the café will just look at a plate of doughnuts.
The second considers throwing them at people.
- The third gets up and starts throwing.
- No!
- Such people don´t exist.
- Where would you place Saturnin?
- Such people don´t exist.
- Where would you place Saturnin?
- Excuse me, madam.
- No!
We´ve moved, sir.
We´re living on a boat now.
Thank you, Saturnin.
On a boat by Legions´ Bridge?
I don´t believe him.
You think that, if you had a flat this morning, you have one now?
Your flat was like a primeval cave.
You liked it because you inherited it from your cave- dwelling ancestors.
- Your flat has a ponderous air about it.
- You exaggerate, doctor.
I´ve brought you some doughnuts for your trip, Mr Oulický.
Mr Saturnin said you´re going to the North Pole, he´s cleaning your weapons.
Don´t distress yourself, I´il send you a postcard of a polar bear.
A polar bear?
Welcome, captain.
The boat´s ready, dinner is prepared.
Let me take those.
Doughnuts will be served with coffee.
Your boat, your favourite easychair, your dinner.
- It´s the steamboat doing that.
- Does this happen often?
- Twice a day.
You´il hear the horn.
- Better to flee to dry land.
- Would you like the lights on?
- Yes.
But if it means sinking the boat, I´d rather dine in the dark.
Would you like a candle, gas lamp or electric light?
I suppose they´re submerged.
We´re not dependent on electricity, captain.
I think I´d prefer the gas lamp.
That I killed a shark with a camera tripod.
My boss asked me to sell him a crocodile tooth.
I don´t hunt tigers or sharks!
Stop telling my friends this nonsense!
That will be difficult.
They think you shot all these animals.
Is anyone down there?
Are you down there, Mr Oulický?
- I´m looking for Mr Oulický.
- How can I help you?
I´m coming down.
Marcus Aurelius has escaped!
We need you to help us catch him.
A man of unsound mind!
I´m not sure I understand.
Don´t be so modest.
Just get your rifle.
- You´d better not be involved in this!
- I swear to you that I am not.
- You ought to help that man.
- But he´s deranged!
- Haven´t you got a weapon?
- No.
Mr Oulický.
I admire your willingness and courage.
I´m sorry I didn´t see you catch the lion with your bare hands.
- Thank you.
- I thank you, too.
- Marcus Aurelius is a lioness.
- No- one´s perfect, sir.
- Few women have straight legs, eh?
- They need you on court.
- Hello.
- Hello.
My partner hasn´t arrived.
Shall we have a game, we mustn´t be idle!
I´d be very glad to.
- You play without a racket?
- No, sorry.
Are you ready?
- Shall we take a break?
- In the middle of the set?
- We need to rest, have a drink...
- Do you take rests when you´re hunting?
In that case, it´s quite the opposite.
It´s a training wall, sir.
It´s a disgrace losing to Miss Terebová 3: 0.
Where did you learn to play tennis, Saturnin?
- I used to coach a certain lady.
- Are you a champion swimmer as well?
And low over the net, that´s this line on the wall.
We´il have to make it higher.
I´m playing billiards, I´il dine out.
And don´t move us anywhere else.
You surprised me.
Your new flat speaks of courage and a sporting spirit.
- You know how many boats sink each year?
- But not on the Vltava.
But they do sink to the bottom.
- The ship´s boiler might explode.
- Our boat hasn´t got a boiler.
My uncle František was an explosives expert.
But he passed away.
I remember his famous explosion.
I was afraid of soap after that.
Uncle František had a laboratory and a wife called Kateøina.
To make fine soap from fine raw materials is not an art!
To make soap from filth and grime is a task for a scientist.
Screw on the compressed oxygen pipe!
You pour this in there, gentlemen.
Turn the valve when I say!
- Will it turn out as soap, sir?
Blast!
Originally he had 20 employees, but only a few remained.
- Really, gentlemen!
- You said there´d be a blast!
I´m making soap, not dynamite.
I said ´´blast´´!
I wasn´t being literal!
His staff then went to find safer work in an explosives factory.
What are we waiting for?
- Can I help you, madam?
- Put my luggage on the boat!
- I am Jiøí´s aunt.
- I fear you are not expected.
Welcome a guest and you welcome God.
My version of that proverb is somewhat different.
Welcome on board, old chap!
Don´t ´´old chap´´ me when you can´t even do up your pyjamas properly.
Sun is the best medicine, Jiøí.
It´s too dark in our flat, the spa´s too expensive and Milouš is ill.
He´il be right as rain here.
The more the merrier.
Two heads are better than one.
- Too many cooks spoil the broth.
- This is my man- servant, Saturnin.
We´ve already met.
- No smoking on board.
- Who asked you?
Your man- servant is a bit strange.
This boat is too small for four people.
My husband supplied the whole family with floor wax!
But it stank and the wood turned black.
Nice boat.
I´il mend the sail tomorrow.
This boat runs on a propeller.
It hasn´t got a sail?
We have to buy a sail for the pole!
Poles are for flags.
Sails are tied to masts.
- This boat doesn´t have a mast.
- That´s true.
I´m tired.
Let´s go to bed.
Good night.
Milouš!
Dr Vlach says that if we find the idyil, we´il stop appreciating it.
Fate would be doing us a good turn if it suddenly turned frosty.
But there´s no frost out here.
Would you prefer your aunt and Milouš to leave?
They´re in their pyjamas.
I can´t imagine their departure to occur without casualties.
It´s half past ten.
By midnight your boat will be empty.
- Is that you, Milouš?
- What?
- I´ve brought you some masks.
- Is there a carnival going on?
We´ve got rats here.
Put these masks on.
- You´ve got rats here?
- I´m afraid we have.
Milouš!
I give it two minutes.
You just needed to say the word.
- Why don´t we launch the boat?
- Aye aye, captain!
It was a real problem finding Advent masks in July.
- What if she hadn´t believed us?
- I´d have gone to find some rats.
Life is wonderful!
- What´s happening, Saturnin?
- I fear we´ve encountered a weir!
- What weir?
- By Charles Bridge.
- Is this boat insured?
- Of course.
- Where´s the next weir?
- Štvanice, but that one´s bigger.
- Did he really say 50 years?
- Yes, but on 3 conditions.
That we sail to the North Pole, that we name her after his fiancée and that we name the first land we discover after him.
- What is his fiancée called?
- They´re about to separate.
He´il let us know when he finds another fiancée.
I went on holiday to see my grampa, who used to run a power station.
He was a member of any club which had anything to do with electricity.
His house was 100% electrified which fascinated me as a boy.
The director wishes you the best of health and sends you this brandy.
Gentlemen don´t drink alcohol before noon.
That is true.
But something terrible has happened!
Don´t trifle with me, Saturnin.
Is it really that bad?
Yes.
There´s no stopping a woman with a mission.
Aunt Kateøina and Milouš have just arrived.
Saturnin is behaving like a lout!
Unlike some, Saturnin was invited to this house.
- You didn´t greet aunt Kateøina?
My dear, how do you do.
He said ´´Oh dear, how d´you do´´.
- So he did, then.
- This is dreadful!
- I´m going for a walk.
- I´il help the director in his garage.
Milouš!
Welcome.
Grampa said he´d be long dead before you got here.
He´il only die if his greedy heirs finish him off.
Grampa wants to accelerate his departure from this world.
Saturnin is teaching grampa jujitsu.
It might work on aunt Kateøina.
- She´s here as well?
- She´s everywhere.
- Welcome.
I´m not doing so well.
- But you look better.
How´s the jujitsu going?
- Tumitsu, Saturnin?
- Haisatsu is better, sir.
Haisatsu!
Are you all right?
I´ve got two broken legs, a few broken ribs and concussion.
I think I´ve sprained my ankle.
- What kind of hold is this?
- First aid, sir.
- Has Miss Terebová arrived?
- Who?
My friend engineer Tereba´s daughter.
A nice young lady.
I forgot to pack your tennis racket.
- Plaster is unwelcome on holiday.
- Miss Terebová has arrived.
- Let´s have a look, then.
- Are you going to X- ray my right foot?
- Yes.
- But I injured the left one.
We need to take both legs so we can compare them.
- Ouch!
- Sorry, I didn´t catch that.
Dr Zajíèek is very thorough.
He says it´s nothing.
Perhaps he´s right.
- Sorry to disturb.
We´re ready to go.
- Have you got a permit to leave?
- No.
- You have to get one from the office.
- Where is the office?
- There´s no- one there now.
- You get one from the office.
- From whom, if no- one´s there?
- No- one.
- But they conveyed us here.
- That´s what ambulances are for.
You don´t need one to leave.
- Is the driver a relative of yours?
- No.
I´m trying to negotiate here.
You might hear someone in distress.
- The vehicle´s just standing idle!
- It´s only for patients.
You´il be the patient soon!
In the surgical and psychiatric wards.
Just write in the permit that the patient didn´t survive the journey!
Where have you been?
It´s going to rain!
- It´s dangerous.
Will we get through?
- Of course we will.
If this was a film, the bridge would be swept away by the water.
Perhaps you really did kill that shark.
Once a child, always a child!
I told him he´d catch a chill!
- Like water off a duck´s back!
- Right.
What are you talking about?
Grampa took his raincoat and boots and went out into the storm.
He wants to see the competition making electricity.
It´s the last straw that breaks the camel´s back.
Well, the bridge is broken.
Cook´s on the other side.
This place is suitable as a power station but not a house.
What have you got growing there?
Better use a hankie.
I´m expecting an important letter!
The postman has to get through!
The electricity´s not working.
- Someone´s got to see to the kitchen.
- I´il go and have a look.
She´il cook better than Kateøina.
I´il find some alternative lighting.
Alternative lighting?
I´m going to make some torches.
It´s raining and there´s no electricity.
At least Barbora´s here.
Miss Terebová permitted you to call her Barbora?
She hasn´t gone unnoticed.
You take a fancy to twentysomethings?
You´re too old for that.
I bet you that by the end of the week...
- Help!
His whiskers are on fire!
- Get some water!
- Not water!
Sand!
- Sand!
- I have an unusual request.
- I like unusual requests.
We agreed that Saturnin would pursue Milouš relentlessly.
Out of revenge for Milouš referring to Miss Terebová in that manner.
Did grampa really ask Milouš to go out and look for worms?
He said that idleness could destroy a young man.
Chess rules do not permit long and short castling.
I know!
I´il put it back.
That young lady can´t cook.
I´ve brought you some stewed fruit.
I want to play chess!
Chess requires concentration.
Impossible with aunt Kateøina around.
What about a glass of milk?
I´il leave you, then.
- I´ve got some worms.
- So what?
I want to play chess!
- Check.
- Those are my figures.
- No!
- Yes!
The table is laid.
Who shut Milouš in his room?
Silence speaks louder than words.
Saturnin told me about his last place of employment.
You either stand too far away or you stand too near!
This rose is unseemly for a person of my age and it doesn´t match my dress!
It´s disgraceful serving me meringue at my age!
Absolutely not!
The table is laid.
- Lunch was excellent, Miss Barbora.
- You have our appreciation.
- We need food, let´s go mushrooming!
- Wonderful idea!
- Easy won, easy lost.
- Go elsewhere if you don´t like it.
- Old people shouldn´t eat mushrooms.
- Then don´t eat them!
- We won´t find any mushrooms like this.
- We must split into two groups.
We´il draw for it.
Give me some matches.
Those who draw the same length will pair up.
The oldest draw first.
No head on mine!
We keep choosing but we still come back to the first variant.
- No head on mine, either.
- Come on, Jiøí.
Just as well we found mushrooms.
Auntie gave the food to Milouš.
- Don´t you want jam on those?
- Did they leave us any?
That´s a good thing.
How many days before one of us has to brave the water and cross the river to get food?
3 to 4 days.
No need to worry, I´ve arranged with the builder that if the old bridge is washed away he´il build a new one.
Allow me, young man.
- You did that on purpose!
- I´m not malicious.
Sit on it properly, silly boy!
Only my chair collapses and someone´s been moving my furniture about.
My birch water was replaced with paraffin!
Someone put a wasp in my boots and it bit me!
- Wasps don´t bite!
- Well, this one did!
People get cabin fever when they´re always together.
Like us.
Let´s go on an outing to my log cabin, then.
We can spend the night in the cabin and then go into town.
Whoever wants can stay here and we´il bury him when we get back.
- What if someone doesn´t last out?
- We´il throw him to the wild animals.
- Don´t know what group I belong in.
- Don´t use your tennis as a gauge.
Sorry, I thought you were a robber.
Why are you fighting?
Who broke that vase?
Who gave Milouš a weapon?
Who´s ringing the doorbell?
I put a match there so we´d know when the electricity was working.
- I can hear someone talking.
- It´s in Spanish!
- All the food´s disappeared!
- Let´s ask Saturnin.
- Don´t bring the servants into this.
- Perhaps he took the food.
No- one suspects Saturnin.
You make your bed, you lie in it.
Just as long as we don´t end up serving Saturnin.
- No use crying over spilt milk.
- Someone drank the milk.
I´ve got an important letter waiting for me and we´re arguing about food!
No- one has started building a new bridge yet.
What´s happened to the food we had for our journey?
- This is getting ridiculous!
- Don´t interfere, Kateøina!
Madam Kateøina will tell you.
- Let´s talk in private.
- You can talk here.
No I can´t!
- Call Saturnin!
- I told Saturnin to take the food.
When there´s danger, women and children have to go first!
So, you want to leave the weaker of us to the wild beasts.
We thought we wouldn´t make the journey.
We ate everything!
I didn´t know mother took the food.
I´m not a child!
Our mistake.
We made light of a danger which poses no threat.
- Will you take my knapsack?
- Yes.
- There´s a deer over there.
- Where?
- Between the beech trees.
- I can´t see it.
- You have to look from here.
- It´s wonderful!
You´re like a young man again!
A sound mind in a healthy body.
You mustn´t believe those proverbs.
They took a man to hospital five times.
He thought a dog´s bark is worse than his bite.
A friend of mine stayed here and he said he´d leave the key here.
Dear doctor, I like your sense of humour.
In Prague you said climbing trees is extremely beneficial.
I didn´t find the key but a note saying it was up in a tree.
I suspected the worst.
It wasn´t 5 metres, but 7 metres up.
But it turned out well in the end.
I spent a lovely week here.
You´il find the key in the pool.
Happy diving!
- How deep is it?
- About 2 metres.
- 3 metres?
4 perhaps?
- It´s not that deep.
- Come on, doctor.
- Jump?
Well I´il be!
That was a terrible dive!
Some people love water.
Is this the one, doctor?
I´m going to make a speech!
It was all uphill yesterday.
Today it´s all downhill.
When we get to the town we´il dine in style.
Hooray!
Aah!
- Hang on, grampa!
- It´il be all right.
Pull it gently.
- Upwards?
- No, to the right!
- Gently move it to the left!
- Why don´t you all gently get lost?
I told you: don´t count your chickens before you´re out of the woods!
- We´il have to spend the night here.
- Don´t be ridiculous!
There´s nothing else for it.
Madam, your blanket.
You take two blankets.
You´re injured.
- Where did you get the blankets?
- I brought them with me.
- Are you going to do your speech now?
- Yes.
Good night!
- We´ve got a hard day tomorrow.
- Good night.
You ought to have a shave.
- What´s the matter?
- I saw you.
May our land be troubled until the battle ceases.
Each stand in their place so long as the battle wages.
He who renounces his land, the blade will find his traitorous chest!
- Are you going to have a wash?
- No, and I´m not shaving, either.
Great idea, Saturnin.
- I´ve got a bottle like that in the cabin.
- I know, this is it, doctor.
Hunger is the best sauce.
Prepare for the worst.
I think my hunger has passed.
Thank the builder for me.
And buy me some aluminium acetate.
I´m going home.
Young men may die but old men must die.
My husband was your son.
He´il ask you up there if his wife and son are taken care of.
You´re almost 70.
How long do you think you´il live?
Barbora and I went to make purchases in town.
The shop assistant thought we were married.
I liked that.
And Miss Barbora didn´t seem to mind, either.
Why was Bellerophon never able to catch Pegasus?
- Where?
Up there.
- The single rooms are all occupied!
- Put your dressing gown on!
People who jump off trams will be immediately caught by the police!
- The director´s writing his will.
- Grampa is a wise man!
He´s not in a fit state to decide about his estate.
I hope you´re not implying that grampa is of unsound mind.
The director has made his decision.
His relatives will be satisfied.
- Everyone will be taken care of.
- Not everyone!
Does he realise this?
The director has left his entire estate to charity.
- Don´t jump!
It´s not high enough!
- Milouš!
We´re leaving!
I´m going to have that will invalidated.
I hope you´re not implying that grampa is of unsound mind.
Madam!
She´s gone mad.
There we have it!
She´s gone mad.
There we have it!
I never asked you for anything in 30 years.
But I have a request now.
I´d like Saturnin to stay with me.
We´ve got a plan.
Books state that young men stick out their chin, prepared for battle.
Human anatomy rules out this posture.
We´ve found 120 examples of this nonsense.
And we´ve only gone through one volume in the library.
Don´t look at the driver while the car is moving!
Talking is not allowed but looking is.
In this car it´s the other way round.
- May I invite you somewhere?
- Yes.
- When?
- Anytime.
- Wednesday at three at the National?
- Do I need to wear a life jacket?
Last time, I wrote to you about the Public Plot Probability Office.
Anyone can write to us who thinks the author takes him for a fool.
He sends us the text and we tell him the truth of the matter.
Here´s an example:
A blue cloud of cigar smoke rose above the desk of Dubský the industrialist.
He received Sláma the clerk coldly.
But Sláma was incensed.
He discovered his boss intended to marry off his daughter to a banker.
Sláma cried:
You villain!
- What did you say?
- You´re a villain and an egotist!
Your daughter loves me!
You´re forcing her into marriage because of money!
I won´t let that happen!
Sláma banged his fist on the table.
Dubský the industrialist went pale.
The Public Plot Probability Office discovered the following:
He´d had a hard day.
A blue cloud of cigarette smoke rose above his desk.
He received Sláma in a normal fashion.
The clerk couldn´t speak for anger.
- illvain!
- What did you say?
Sogetit!
Dour laughter moves ye!
The industrialist was afraid for his employee´s sanity.
The industrialist had 2 daughters.
One married a banker she loved.
The younger one doesn´t want to marry.
Our Office hereby states that only the cloud of smoke is true.
- Guess who?
- Good afternoon, Barbora.
- What would you like?
- Coffee and something sweet.
Waiter, the lady would like a coffee and some doughnuts.
- Doughnuts?
- Yes.
Every story should end with a wedding.
So I won´t disappoint you.
A wedding was held in St Anthony´s for aunt Kateøina.
You have decided before Almighty God to accept the holy state of matrimony.
I know I was well advised to offer you this story.
But if you take me for being impertinent I cannot let this calumny lie.
You can always send me to the place no- one likes to go.
Don´t look upon my grey hair, I don´t even know if I have any.
So long as the spotlights and stage exist, I could sorely part with them.
BELGRADE, 24 th MARCH 1999
Action!
I can' t go on like this.
Tomorrow you' il bring out the tanks so you can sleep with me...
To sleep with you...
Good.
Good.
Guys, I want all mobiles off please.
Sharpen up on two, and lower the shutter.
Come on pal, jump to it.
Let' s go, let' s go!
Put up the black- screen.
What do you mean there isn' t one?
Don' t fuck with me, pal.
Lule... don' t screw me around.
I said that?
When?
If shooting has to stop because of your shitty 5 million... fine.
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, I didn' t mean it literally.
I know every cent counts here.
Hey, Lule...
Daddy!
Masa, my pride and joy!
The lab material is here.
I' ve scheduled the screening, but the audio track is still a problem.
- No.
- Why, Bosa?
Lola will kill me.
Let' s not tell mummy you didn' t eat, OK?
Don' t bother me with this crap.
It' s just that he says he can' t record without one.
Forget recording.
Don' t swear.
- Only I could hire a deaf soundman.
Don' t drop it!
It' s not State property!
What the hell!
Break it!
Why should you care...?
For you... - Who is it?
- No.
Some Ugrinovich guy...
Are you insane?
Didn' t I say I didn' t want to talk to him?
Get out, Bosa.
You always screw up.
Lule' s just rung.
Said everything' s been paid in.
It hasn' t?
Must be the bank.
He just rang.
Sent you his regards and said it' s all OK.
There' s no need to be like that.
You can threaten me all you like, but...
I r... r... ran out of juice.
- How the hell, Aca?
You emptied the barrel too?
All my money goes on gas...
You design sets, you don' t drive.
And lvana?
- What about lvana?
They drive her home and back three times a day.
- Her, an actress!
She' s an idiot.
OK, she' s an idiot, but she' s still an actress.
Say Sergei banned it and that' s final.
Thinks it' s just for her.
CLENCH YOUR TEETH!
No!
Stop!
It can 't be like this, Dusan!
Djole, turn it up.
I can' t hear a thing!
I said we needed 200 extras.
200!
We' re not shooting "Star Wars".
Your idiots have just arrested a girl.
For God' s sake, Djole, turn it up.
I can' t hear a thing.
This machine was left behind by the Germans after the War.
Who the hell let this idiot in?
Hey, buddy, like the movies, eh?
What' s that?
Service.
I mean I wasn' t expecting you.
Stupid, huh?
I mean why would I?
This is a feature film, eh?
Well spotted.
I' m the producer, Sergei.
We' re a small new company...
Watch this bit!
- And what' s this new film of yours called?
"Chicken".
As in birds.
- Look at that shot!
It' s innocent tales of youth...
"RED BANDlTS"... no politics.
"RED BANDlTS"
A sophisticated melodrama.
Djordje, would you please turn off that projector?
- Is that better?
Sergei!
Did you tell this jackass not to drive me home anymore?
Call me a jackass again and I' il fuck you!
I dare you to repeat that in front of Sergei!
We' ve got a guest.
Our guest.
Ivana Gvozdenovic, the famous actress.
The man probably knows me.
I' il kill you for that.
Ah, here' s Dusan.
Tell him what you said a minute ago.
- Did you really?
Yeah, and then he said he' d fuck me!
- Did you really?
- No.
No one said anything to anyone.
Are you here or not?
God, Bosiljka, you ask some stupid questions.
You can see I' m here.
Tell him I' m in a meeting.
He' s here but he' s not here.
That' s what us filmmakers say.
- Really?
- Yes.
Mrs Minister and I are close friends, so she puts her...
Wonderful woman... an artist, plays the piano.
I don' t give a... so rude - So rude.
Is he still in Belgrade?
Which Harvey Jackson?
- Yes.
- No, no.
He' s not.
Really?
- Lf we' re thinking of the same Harvey... and if we' re thinking of Belgrade, our Belgrade...
There' il be war.
- There' il be war.
There' s a problem with his money.
Due to the imminent danger of war we blocked his money.
Idiot left it in the bank.
We reckon he belongs to some fairly suspicious groups.
Harvey?!
- Yes.
Do you know Harvey?
- The worst kind.
That money, you know.
You' re right, the money' s ours.
Here, take this.
If he contacts you, call me.
Thank you.
Wonderful place this.
- Thanks, thanks.
Hi, Sreta, love?
It' s Sergei.
Check my foreign currency account.
It' s urgent.
Madam, that' s enough of your patriotic speech.
It' s the fifth time they say they' il bomb us, so what?
When is the Ministry going to pay in the money?
It' s not?
Who?
Well, I' ve been waiting for a year to meet the Minister.
Listen, you cow.
No, not you Sreta, sorry.
Zero?
How the hell?
I' il be right there.
Shit, I' m fucked...
Lidija.
Nicely done, eh?
- I don' t believe it.
And tomorrow?
Tomorrow you' il get the tanks out so you can fuck me.
You can' t stop them.
Is that clear?
Excellent.
Let' s go once more.
Once more?
Dusan, why are we doing it again?
You can' t say "fuck".
- Why?
It' s not appropriate.
You' re a nice girl.
A student.
And don' t overact.
More natural?
- Yeah.
Ilija, you were great.
What do you say about NATO?
That I' il take on...
Just go up to her and say yes.
And come on, guys.
You' re meant to be in love.
Let' s go!
Crew, extras.
Come on!
Sound!
I said sound!
- I said running.
He did, Dule, I swear.
- Like fuck he did.
Camera!
- Speed... 16- 1- 2
Action!
Stop!
No, Djole!
I' ve told you to be quicker.
Fine, I' m going quicker.
Milun, just a bit quicker.
Thanks.
Let' s go.
Sound!
Camera!
- Speed.
16- 1- 3.
Stop.
I never said 'running'.
I said sound.
- But I didn' t say 'running'.
Well say it, for God' s sake!
Sound!
- Running!
Camera.
- Speed.
Scene 16, shot 1, take 4.
A little violet dress, you put on, when you went to kiss him, to kiss him.
And you were my true love.
Let' s!
A little violet dress...
Stop!
Guys...
Anyone else here gonna screw me around?
- Shut up!
The w... w... war started!
Stop, guys.
Can you hear it?
Don' t swear, daddy.
- I won' t.
What is it, Bosiljka?
I had no idea.
Who stopped the shooting?
Wait for me...
Where' s Harvey?
When?
He went to the hotel to pick up his things.
I told you, to make sure he stayed in the studio.
Wait for me, all of you.
Are you scared, honey?
- Aha.
- Don' t be.
Get the bastard Yankee!
Is that him?
Shut the fuck up!
Take him over there, quickly!
You think you can bomb us, huh?!
What the fuck...
- Shut up!
You' re bombing us.
Well done Mileta, sir!
What?
Oh, yeah.
Mileta has him now.
Quick.
We leapt into action as soon as you called.
There are spies all around us.
Keep your eyes peeled.
OK, take it easy.
Enough.
You too.
If you notice anything suspicious, ring me.
Fucking cunts!
Mother fuckers...
What are you going to do now, Dusan?
Let this beautiful part of mine go to waste?
Like fuck they won' t start on us.
We' re warriors, eh?
They' il ruin us.
We won' t recover for 100 years.
We wanted the Yanks to think we were tough.
Dusan, if you' ve got nothing clever to say, shut up.
Have a think and let me know when we' il start shooting again, realistically.
And I mean realistically.
Realistically!
Wait!
No one from number 45 and only 8 from number 30.
- We' il go by the list.
I have to go in!
Ahh, our famous actress!
Please, go in!
I have to as well...
- Read out the bloody names.
Wait!
Take it easy.
Oh, fucking hell...
Where' s the American?
Mind your own business.
It' s a government matter.
Let me introduce myself.
I am Mileta.
From Secret Service.
Where do you think you' re going mother fucker?
Bosa said we' ve finished filming.
Who?
Who told you to pack up?
- Bosa says filming' s over.
Put everything back!
You think you can decide when to stop shooting?
You all need a damn good kick up the arse.
- Fucking slave driver.
A few bombs and you artists shit your pants!
It' s OK for Mr. Producer to show up when the war' s over!
Bombs are falling, and he...
- Cut the crap, Tatula!
What did he say?
What?
I didn' t hear.
The sirens went off and then the windows smashed... - Where?
Upstairs.
- It seems anyone can stop filming whenever they want!
I can stop whenever I want!
There' s no money for the tapes.
And you strut around Belgrade with that American.
I don' t want to see him ever again.
Is that clear?
If you want to know who stopped filming, I' il tell you.
He did!
And as for Communism, that' s none of your business.
What' s that about Communism?
- He' s winding you up.
You want me to kick the shit out of you, huh?
What shall I do with this guy?
Ugrinovic again?
- No, the police.
Please, don' t take him to my place.
My mom' s sick.
- Hey, Sergei, sorry I' m late.
Tatula' s only j... j... just told me about the money.
Pay day, eh!?
No.
Tatula, you f... f... fucking lying bastard.
Why' s he b... b... bleeding?
We' re at home Lola, where else?
No, the phone' s in the other room.
Everything' s fine.
We' re waiting for you.
- Good evening.
Good evening.
Really?
And did daddy bring any money?
No.
But he brought Harvey to sleep at your place.
Good evening.
I' il throw both of you off the balcony.
Not in front of the kid, Tatula.
- Idiot.
What' il become of us?
Where' ve you been the whole night?
Which question do you want me to answer first?
You' re probably the only man not to come home tonight.
There was a problem on set.
- Don' t swear.
Why were the police looking for you?
Where were they looking for me?
They left this.
- What' s going on, Segei?
It' s because of Harvey...
Our Harvey?
He' s an American, and so they hate him.
Why are they bombing us?
It' il only be for a few days.
What does' a few days' mean?
It means this isn' t one of your big wars like 1941.
What?
I' m supposed to starve because there' s a war on.
Even in World War Two people still ate.
Fuck, there they go again.
You know, these planes are really turning me on.
Get lost, Sergei.
Honestly!
A guy from Sarajevo told me.
You make love like it' s your last time ever.
- Who?
Ah, that guy.
He said he did it 6 times.
Twice will do me.
Damn you.
Smile!
Cheers.
At Easter.
And we were allies, friends.
- Yeah, yeah...
You want something, someone...?
There isn' t anyone.
All the women are underground...... in the shelters.
6TH APRlL 1941
THE GERMANS BOMBED BELGRADE
THlS IS HOW BELGRADE LOOKED IN APRlL 1941
FlLMED BY AN AMATEUR BELGRADE CAMERAMAN.
Listen to me.
I know.
- I know.
On the telephone.
You know what to tell him?
- Of course I do.
Go on then, and don' t screw up.
When have I ever screwed up?
- When haven' t you?
So...
That' s not true.
So what?
- Look, Bosa' s been injured.
Put on something decent.
We' ve got to go to her parents'.
Quick.
As if you' d have come with me any other way.
Stop the car.
I' m getting out.
Wait.
I remembered that film of yours last night...... the one you were thrown out of the Academy for.
- Piss off.
Man, that was an ingenious film.
What was the name of that young actress I screwed?
Milica?
- Yeah, Milica.
I heard she hanged herself after that.
That was your greatest film.
I realized then we' d work together on something big.
I didn' t like it.
Thank God it was in black and white.
Excellent story!
A romance between a German officer... and a resistance girl in occupied Belgrade.
Yeah, it was really funny!
So, we' ve got an excellent story.
We' ve got the crew, the camera, the tape, we' ve got Harvey.
Get it?
- He' s off his head.
I don' t give a damn.
Go on, Harvey.
You' re a real Serb!
He' il make a good actor.
Maybe.
We' ve got to hurry.
Is this any way to begin a press conference?
Fucking hell.
- What did he drink?
Tatula' s homemade shit.
- I told him just a drop.
Come on, Bosa.
Guys.
I' il be doing the killing, jerk!
Yesterday Belgrade came under heavy bombardment.
Our beloved country was attacked without mercy.
Nineteen countries began an all- out war...... against our oppressed nation.
- That' s a lot!
I believe the time has come...... to rise up and defend our homeland.
- Tatula!
As you know we recently began filming our latest film...... 'Chicken'.
They stayed at work, filming in the face of the enemy.
I don' t normally do this but I would ask for...... a warm round of applause for these brave souls.
Thank you.
Thank you, heroes!
But whilst bombs fall, with us here, there' s an American...... brave enough to say a historical 'NO'... to his President, his country, and their evil.
Plus, he decided to invest his hard- earned money... from who knows what... maybe the oil platforms... in our film.
The wartime love story of an American and a Serbian girl.
What' s more, the American will star in it.
Ladies and gentlemen...... I give you the one and only living American in Belgrade...... Mr. Harvey Jackson.
Bravo!
Working without pay.
Finally I' d like to mention a typically artistic gesture...... made by the old but enthusiastic Tatula.
This brave soundman has told me today...
He doesn' t want one cent for the film.
He said to me
'Friend, take my pay and spend it the way you know best.'
Bravo Tatula!
Bravo!
Thank you everyone.
We' il take questions over cocktails downstairs.
Filming starts tomorrow.
Long live Serbia!
- Thank you.
You' re a very cunning man.
The heavy artillery, a press conference, journalists, TV...... and all that to save a Yankee, eh?
No?
Is it then to save his money, eh?
Because you need it for the film?
Well, there can' t be a film without money.
He spoke like the President.
- What charisma!
- There as well.
Filmmaking during war is an unpredictable matter.
A lottery.
Hi, I' m Djole, director of photography.
Irresistible Djole!
We must use all our weapons.
Including film.
I think you' ve underestimated its value up till now.
- Me?
Not you personally.
Film is a powerful weapon.
Tonight it' il be shown all round the globe.
If you don' t want this crew though...
The media war must be fought more seriously this time.
Being humane is very important right now.
Not only us film guys, but you television guys as well.
Everyone.
Why all this patriotism?
- Why?
You artists aren' t exactly the State' s best buddies.
It' s not you and us anymore.
The first bomb' s been dropped.
Now we' re one.
Clearly the whole thing has fermented...... and is more elaborate, structurally speaking.
The woman I play is the bravest creature I' ve known.
I haven' t got to know her yet, but I' m working on it.
It' s not easy.
She' s deep...... but that' s a greater challenge for us actresses.
It' s easy when there' s peace, but now when it' s... shit happens...
Thank you.
- What?
Do you really think he can act?
Harvey?
Harvey' s amazing.
All Americans can act.
Two of their Presidents were actors.
Who was the second?
This one' s a musician.
He doesn' t look like an actor to me.
An actor doesn' t have to be handsome.
We just need a bit of money.
If you do as you say, that won' t be a problem.
Dule, bullshit something!
I can' t do it all by myself.
He' s never been in cinema.
Fuck depleted uranium, depleted war...
What are you looking at?
I know there was a siren, Lola.
I heard it.
I' il be 5 minutes.
How' s Masa?
Stay calm.
OK, 2 minutes...
CHlLD CRlES IN THE WAR FLAME
YOU' RE GONE AND SO IS YOUR DRESS,
WlLL THE SUN EVER SHlNE ON US
WHEN YOU WENT TO KlSS HlM, AND YOU WERE MY TRUE LOVE
What was that?
Play!
No need to shit yourself from one bomb.
Go on, play!
Three, four.
WHEN YOU WENT TO KlSS HlM, AND YOU WERE MY TRUE LOVE
Bravo, four eyes!
Do you like the movies?
I like sport as well.
Your colleague' s Ukrainian, eh?
Handsome guy.
We make a film, they bomb us, each to his own...
But maybe we' il make a good film...
I think Sergei fucked up.
Guys, I' ve n... n... never heard such crap.
No, the story' s OK, but where did they find this guy?
First, he' s no actor, second he' s American.
Never!
The Yank' s better than lvana, isn' t he Aca?
A million times.
- She' s such a bore.
How can you say that Dule' s wife' s a whore?
I didn' t.
Shame on you.
You did, you did.
- Honestly I didn' t.
Good hit!
We' il win.
Serbia!
Serbia!
Hi, honey.
We' re home.
- Who' s' we '?
Harvey and I.
It' s just for a few days... or a few months, I promise.
Good evening, Lola.
Good thing the whole crew didn' t come.
You' re an idiot.
Bombs, sirens, I' m home alone with Masa...... and you' re gallivanting around bars.
We were celebrating a bit.
So I saw.
It was on the State News.
The press conference?
You and Dule looked great.
You should think about taking up politics.
Bye!
What' s up, sweetie?
Shall we frighten them off, Masa?
How, daddy, when I can' t see any of them?
- They can see us.
Yeah, they can, the bastards.
Shoo, stupid planes.
- Shoo, stupid planes.
- Shoo, stupid planes.
That' s right.
He can' t.
He' s from their country.
They' ve gone, daddy.
- No.
The theme' s forbidden love.
Just like in my student film.
The same bombing.
Just it' s an American instead of a German.
Now, you hug not noticing the people gathering around you who have found out he' s an American.
Then you start kissing...
- Kissing Harvey?
- Yeah.
Pretend or real?
With tongues?
- Pretend.
In front of all these...... people in the bomb shelter.
They want to lynch you but...
- God, Dusan.... the Yank, who' s a total stranger somehow pulls out an
Why?
Because he burns it in front of everyone in the shelter.
To save himself and to show how much he loves you.
- Well, OK.
They are already starting to smile.
You carry on kissing.
They begin to clap.
'Serbia, Serbia'.
He takes you in his arms...... and makes for the exit.
It' s just like in 'Officer and a Gentleman', isn' t it?
Dule!
- Yeah?
This flag burning' s great.
And Harvey?
- What about him?
He has to burn his country' s flag.
Who cares?
He' s a bigger Serb than the two of us.
Will someone get that fucking phone!
Just don' t expect the film to be big in America.
What do we care?
Hey, Bosa, answer the phone!
Fucking hell...
What if we forget about burning the flag...... and they fuck under it instead?
- Yeah.
Why not?
Lvana' s a professional.
I know, but screwing in a shelter!
I don' t know...
If I had it my way, I' d make the Yank a totally good guy.
Are you crazy?
That' s why I say let' s forget politics.
We' il do an ordinary love story about two people...... going out in Belgrade, screwing in the shelters.
No pictures to take of the war, nor of the bombing.
Listen.
Don' t complicate things.
Don' t dodge the bombing bit when it' s actually happening.
Sergei, I' m out of here.
Why do we need a s... s... set?
Take a camera, w... w... walk outside and...... there' s much better shots everywhere.
I' ve got to make m... m... mock- up planes at the airbase.
Not you as well, Aca!
What planes?
15 sharp.
You can set you w... w... watch by it.
They' re either stupid or...... they just keep dropping bombs on them.
A bomb will hit you...... our guys will jump into bed with the Yanks soon...... and you' il be six foot under.
Finish up and go.
How will we end the film?
The war ends, and we...
- Win?!
OK, don' t fuck around.
Who knows how this shit will end!
How will it end?
- They can' t just drop bombs on Belgrade.
The Russians, the Chinese...
Don' t give a shit, Sergei!
Forget about the Russians and the Chinese.
They' il fuck us so hard, our eyes will pop out.
The story' s so imbecilic, it' il sell everywhere.
Don' t be stupid and ruin our chances of big bucks.
All I' m saying is add in some patriotic stuff.
The war ends and we' ve got a big film.
How do I look?
- Ivana, we' re not filming "Versace' s murder".
This is a war film.
Find something more suitable.
Fine, and why are we going to screw in a bomb shelter?
In the Hyatt Hotel?
We' re being bombed, for God' s sake!
- So, what?
I have to strip off in front of my neighbors?
What' s he aiming at, Sergei?
- A Balkan Romeo and Juliet.
How cute!
Why didn' t you say so, Dusan?
You can always cut it out after if you don' t like it...
Bosa, why are you messing around?
Look at him, like McCloud himself.
How I love this war!
Senka!
Her name' s Senka!
- Shit, he' s bloody useless.
Lie a bit, guys, else he' il walk out.
Come on, Bosa.
Well done, Harvey!
This is amazing.
- Once more, only without acting.
Without acting?
Do you fancy a drive?
- Maybe in some other life.
How about like this?
Don' t guys, he' s on our side.
He loves Serbia.
Great, honey!
Come on, guys, let' s go.
We' il can it this time.
Quiet!
Ready!
Scene 5, shot 8, take 24.
Action!
He' s on our side.
He loves Serbia.
So why doesn' t he burn the flag?
He doesn' t have to burn the flag.
Why shouldn' t he, Dusan?
- Yeah, why shouldn' t he?
Get out, now!
I' m in charge of the shelter.
What' s happening?
OK, guys.
Calm down.
It' s war.
We' re all a bit edgy.
He' d better burn the flag!
- Bloody traitor!
Guys, this isn' t for real.
Why can' t you see?
He' s one of us.
He loves Serbia.
Serbia!
They' il kill him.
He' d better burn the thing.
Burn it, Harvey.
Burn the flag.
Serbia!
Sergei, what now?
- Teach him to act.
You managed with lvana.
Wood could act better though.
But they wanted to lynch us on day one.
It' il be the same every day.
It' il only last another couple of days.
- That' s all we need.
That' s the last time I' m going to save this asshole.
We should have let them beat him up?
Jackass!
You know, it' s war.
People are upset...... angry.
But, the sort of film I want to make...... won' t get past the government.
And without sponsor' s approval there is no money.
Sponsors, my ass!
After what happened today, we are finished.
Dusan!
- What now, lvana?
Tell him I' m sorry.
I don' t give a damn.
Well, he was good.
It' s obvious he' s got talent.
My prick is more talented!
Maybe it' s better that they don' t deposit the money.
So, we save our asses.... while we still can.
Gentlemen!
I hear we' ve made a successful start.
What' s up, luvvies?
What are you planning?
It looks like the problem' s been solved for us.
Give me a glass!
Cheers!
Cheers!
IMPULSlVE HERO, UNABLE TO RESTRAlN HlMSELF, SHOUTED OUT
THlS IMPROVlSATlON BY
THE TALENTED ACTOR EXClTED EVEN THE COLD CAMERA LENS.
AND MR. JACKSON CALMED THElR SPlRITS,
If they don' t pay me after this, they never will.
What do you say, Loki?
- I don' t know what to say.
Real nice!
MR. HARVEY, WE THANK YOU.
You' ve started working for them openly.
Working for who?
- The government.
And who should I work for?
NATO?
Just answer me this.
What happened to your integrity and honesty?... you were fighting for truth.
I' m a filmmaker.
You sold your soul to them, Sergei.
And for what?
A few dollars, power, a medal.
- What' s up with you, Lola?
I' m just trying to make a movie.
Why' s that so bad?
You' ve never been like th...
I don' t talk to Americans.
What' s up, Lola?
It' s me, your Sergei.
- IQ.
Masa, is he a real American?
How many times do I have to tell you?
He' s a 100% real American...... and he' s living at my place.
Let' s leave.
You, me and Masa.
Please.
- Go where?
We only have to leave.
Please!
Yes?
That' s me.
Thanks.
Our government has given green light.
Cut!
Even more.
I want you bursting with joy.
You' ve done this very well.
I need even more for it to be more realistic.
Let' s take it again.
Hang on a second.
The Minister of Culture would like to say a few words.
Quiet, Bosa!
My dear artists!
Thank you.
Madam Minister, could you repeat that for State TV?
Just make it a bit more attractive.
Snow, rain, wind... - Snow in April?
At this time when the nation is suffering...
Then make the explosions louder.
I have just one word...
So... do we get money... for licking the Minister' s ass?
Shit, you Communists only have money on the mind.
Allow me!
Maybe...
I don' t want to interfere...
Cut!
- Fucking hell!
He, that...
- American.... could still be portrayed as a human being.
Of course.
For instance, we could...... have him save the child in this scene.
- You could?
Unbelievable.
Amazing, truly amazing.
Maybe though...... he should be killed at the end by his own people.
That would be a kind of justice.
It is war after all, isn' t it?
That isn' t in the script?
Stop the rain!
3, 4, end.
Excellent.
Djole?
- It' s good for me.
- That' s a wrap.
You don' t w... w... want your beans?
You should feed yourself up so we can win the war.
If only they' d g... g... go below 5000 meters.
Don' t give me that war shit.
It' s the same for us all.
I' m working...
What do you reckon?
Are those two going to f... f... fuck?
You think they' il just hold hands?
What' s he saying?
He wants to fuck you, as you' re so up for it.
What' s he really saying, Dusan?
So they' ve started to fuck us on the ground as well!
You couldn' t wait for war to sit around on your fat ass.
If you' ve got no dinars, pay in dollars.
What are you doing, Bosiljka?
- I' m just trying it.
Pay it first thing tomorrow, or else.
So much for your invisible plane.
Little shit.
It' s alright for them to take it away...... but when the people want it back...
I just want to try it.
- Go on then, try it.
They' re done for!
How did they hit it if they couldn' t see it?
W...
Fuckers!
Thank God, you' ve finally remembered!
But where?
- Djole, come here.
They' re spending a lot.
- Let them.
What do you care?
How' s the crane?
- You' re crazy, man.
What' s wrong with it?
I' ve always wanted something like this.
Where did you get it?
- A present from CNN.
Come on, guys!
Let' s do some work!
Come on.
Sorry!
Ready.
Sound!
- Running.
Camera speed.
- First shot, take 3.
What the fuck' s this now?
- Don' t panic, guys!
What' s he saying?
Dusan, why won' t you tell me?
Shit, man!
It' s not m... m... me this time, guys.
How much longer?
How fucking long will you fuckers go fucking on?
I don' t believe this.
Everyone' s in the shelter, and we' re on the terrace.
We' re watching war live out in the fresh air.
Hi, Bosa!
Where are you off to?
- For some wine.
I drink and drink, but I can' t get drunk.
Hang on, where' ve you been?
- What?
- Where' ve you been?
With a... young female colleague.
Checking some lenses...
Good evening, buddy.
- Evening, Djole.
I' ve something serious to ask you.
Get away...
- So you haven' t.
She' s not that kind of girl.
- So you have.
We went out together for the first time today.
What does it matter how many times?
It' s war.
When I can look after her, I can.
If I' m filming, I can' t.
Hey, does this go?
- Where' s Masa?
She' s downstairs in the shelter with the other kids.
They love it down there at the moment.
Ah, so the kids are doing OK, eh?
OK, so what' s wrong now?
I didn' t know my kid would grow up in a shelter.
So?
They were missing half a brain to have made a country like this.
Oh, Lola...
Don' t complain!
I' m killing myself making a film about you, and your...
I' m sorry, and how does that film end?
What happens to that brave doctor?
- We haven' t decided yet.
You mean you' re negotiating with the cop over the ending.
Look, Sergei.
If you want the film to be truthful...... and that woman really to be like me, then you can write... write that the doctor packs her bags...... and leaves for Germany with her daughter.
- Fade to black... the end.
They' re pounding us tonight.
I' m heading s... s... south tomorrow.
I swear I' il get even.
Again?
After parading around in that uniform for 10 days!
If you' re going, go!
You might be joking, Tatula, but I' m serious.
Go then, man.
- You want me to I...
I... leave now, huh?
Why don' t you?
- Now?
What the fuck' s wrong with you, eh?
You' il go when it' s all over.
It' s too late then.
Don' t you believe me?
Here, look!
- What is it?
- My draft letter.
Kosovo.
Happy now?
You' re worse than them up there.
What' s up?
- Shut up!
- Idiot.
Hey, Mileta...
- Wiggle that ass.
- Until we win.
In the film we' re winning; that' s all that matters.
Now you' il see how we catch spies!
Come here, spy!
Mileta, look at this, eh!?
Go on, Bosa?
Quiet!
OK.
Aca' s going to Kosovo.
Give him leave for 2 weeks, please.
You can easily make a
MlG, but try making a film in 2 weeks!
I can' t.
Not a hope in hell... he can have 2 days.
Come on, go and pack.
- Stop it, Mileta.
Why do you want me to come back when I don' t want to?
How can I look people in the eyes?
K... osovo and I' m on the s... s... set.
Forget Kosovo!
We' ve got to finish the film.
- Bosa cries at cartoons.
Two days.
- Come here, Sergei.
- Two weeks.
Hey, that' s not a bad idea.
- What?
That his own people kill him.
Well done, Aca.
Shame!
- Why?
- The acting was excellent.
What shall I write?
This one' s the best.
The first and the third.
Just in case.
44- 8 - take 1.
That 's enough smoke, Aca.
The way you act, it 's b... b... better we don' t see!
Why does it have to be him?
Can 't it be someone else?
No, it can 't.
- Shut up, bitch!
Let go of me!
I 'm not going to the army.
See, he says he 's not going.
- Stop taking pictures, fatso!
Well done, Harvey!
Cool!
I won 't!
I won 't!
Run then, bro!
He 's an American.
Don 't lay a finger on him.
An American, eh?
Don' t change anything.
Cut!
Excellent!
You can belt him even harder, just mind the set.
Look what you did to him!
You 're wasting tape.
Hungover, eh, Mile?
I thought you were a good guy...... wanting to help his country.
You' re just a bunch of assholes making films with other people' s money, telling the world the worst lies about your nation.
You' re artists and think you' re entitled to do it.
Wait.
It' s not like that.
Shut up when I' m talking.
What' s the problem?
Don' t play the innocent.
The nation' s being destroyed, children are dying, blood' s being shed.
The world' s competing to see who can harm us most and you lot are fucking around.
No.
I just thought there' s some misunderstanding, so...
There' s no misunderstanding.
It' s all as clear as day.
Only this isn' t the film we wanted, it' s a mockery.
There are many different ways of making a patriotic film.
I can' t make a film with evil Americans and good Serbs.
Yet you can make love scenes with the Yank and our doctor.
This is the greatest tragedy your nation has ever seen and you don' t give a damn.
Even when they are bombing us!
I' il teach you how to make a film...... how to hate your enemies and to love your country.
You don' t know who you' re dealing with.
Sergei!
- What' s happened, Bosa?
They' ve said the hospital' s been hit.
Take his pulse.
He' s lost a lot of blood.
Well, where is she?
Masa, Masa!
Masa!
Sergei, we' re leaving.
You' ve got 2 days to decide if you want to leave with us.
Never.
Does anyone want to tell me what' s happening?
Bosa, why' s that guy so pissed at us?
And you, Dusan, are you going to let him stop the shooting?
When I' m doing the best role of my career.
Good afternoon, everyone.
- Good afternoon.
Sorry I' m late.
We' ve got to pull ourselves together.
What' s filmed is filmed, but we can' t carry on like that.
We can' t mess around while the country' s bleeding.
We are making a film, well I am.
Why are you giving me a hard time?
- Tell you what?
If we film anything, it has to be the truth about the tragedy our people are suffering.
What truth, Sergei?
Don' t give me that propaganda bullshit.
Have we got to change the whole story?
Don' t screw me around!
We' re not changing anything.
Everything stays as it is.
Only we' il be on location more.
We' il go outside, so we can see what they' re doing to us.
Half the country' s been ruined.
We' il put in some authentic, true life shots.
Authentic shots.
Fine, and the story?
What are we going to do with the characters?
Harvey dies trying to save his true love.
Ivana could die as well.
That' s up to you.
Ivana can' t get killed.
- Shut up, lvana.
Tell me, please, why Harvey has to die?
Because I' m sick of us ass licking the Americans.
Nor do I want us all to look like traitorous pussies.
I well know how you became a patriot.
Your bollocks are on the line and you want us to save them.
I won' t direct that kind of film.
You do it, if you want to.
Better still, get that cop to direct it.
Wait, Dule...
Kids!
When we began this film, things were different.
People are dying.
I agree.
Let' s stop filming and wait till the war' s over.
Stop filming because of that idiot...
Bravo, Harvey!
If we stop filming, we' ve achieved nothing.
This way we still have a chance.
I' m heading s... s... south...
I can get hold of some amazing authentic material.
My girl works on the state TV news, so don' t worry.
OK, Djole.
Go to the TV station and pick out the most dramatic stuff.
I need two days to sort out the script.
That' s that.
I don' t get where we fucked up.
It was going so well.
We' re still filming.
See?
Lost?
What if the Russians get involved?
Forget about the Russians.
You laugh.
See you.
We' re off to the TV station to get some footage she found to surprise Serge.
Yeah, yeah!
No, honestly.
Who gives a damn about the film right now?
It takes balls to make a film while there' s a war on.
See you.
- To Kosovo?
"How can we make a film while bombs are falling?"...... you once asked me.
It' s not just any old film.
It takes courage to make because it' s after the truth, without compromises, without ideology, without politics, without dreams of success, without donations, without money, without winners and losers decided in advance.
"Don' t overdo it, Serge," you told me.
Of all of us, Djole was the best.
His life was more truthful and more important...... than the search for truth...... than politics...... than the film itself.
And so today, we bury our film together with him.
Rest in peace.
Are you sure we should go?
I' m sure.... MORE THAN 20 DEAD AND SERlOUSLY HURT JOURNALlSTS
Daddy, there' s a cool zoo where mommy' s taking me.
There' s everything there, honey.
Call as soon as you get there.
When will you come?
- I' ve explained everything to you.
You know everything.
Hold it!
Bye, my love.
What?
No more movie?
- Let' s stop the games, Mileta.
Of course there' s no more movie.
A man died.
My friend.
A great guy.
Do you know how many of my guys have lost their lives?
I know.
Real heroes.
We know how to make films about them...... about make- believe death.
When it' s real though, we can' t handle it so well.
I made a mistake.
Yours?
I thought it was theirs, them with the bombs.
The movie' s off.
There' s a lot of people interested in this movie.
Use your head.
This studio looks kind of sad without a crew.
Mileta!
See you some day when things get better.
THE HOMELAND, HEADS HELD HlGH SPlTING THE NATO AGGRESSOR,
WESTERN CAPlTAL AND THE CONFORMlST PHlLOSOPHY.
THlS GROUP OF FORElGN AGENTS ARE TAKlNG PART IN SPYlNG...
What' s this program?
Look, it' s you lot.
I never knew you were spies.
Some new stars in our sky of spies.
Now when you go outside, the nation will rip you apart in their adoration.
You know that' s not true.
It' s on TV.
But you know it' s not the truth.
As far as the public are concerned, it' s the truth.
You can explain to them after, that it' s not true...... THERE' S NOT MUCH TO SAY.
THE MAN WAS SUSPlCIOUS FROM THE OUTSET.
THERE WERE THE TELEPHONE CALLS TO UNBELlEV...
It' s a tape.
I wanted to hear your professional opinions.
Can this make the headlines?
What did you think?
The state pays you to fuck around?
Who' s for going back to work?
Well done.
You' re free to go.
Tell the American the plot of our latest movie on your way.
Thank you very much.
I don' t need you anymore.
Is that clear?
Go on, get lost!
Why aren 't you answering the phone?
We 're in Germany.
Sergei, it 's Bosa.
If you can, please...... please ring...
Action!
Stop!
It' s no good at all.
Is it... is it clear to you?
Harvey' s been killed by an American bomb.
His guys have killed him.
Shaken, you take that flag and cover him.
Touchingly.
And you with the camera go up, down and then in...... on a close up of those tears, to condemn the crime.
Come on, you went to film school, didn' t you?
Sergej, it 's Dule.
Urgently.
You' re crazy coming to the set in that car.
Mileta will suss us out straight away.
He' s crazy.
Do you know we' re not allowed to mention your name on set?
Careful, careful.
Shut up, if he sees us here, he' il kill us.
He is directing us now.
Do you know Mileta wants to blow up Harvey?
Give over.
We have to go to the airport to film them hitting mock- ups.
He wants to tie him to a plane with a ton of explosives, to blow him to kingdom come.
I can' t believe what I' ve got into.
At the end of filming, he' il shoot us all.
We know too much.
He told me this was the war against the whole Orthodox world.
Sergei, brother, save us.
Otherwise we' re all collateral damage.
Bye.
There 's been no sign of you for days.
Sergei, it 's Bosa.
Bye.
Bosa, if I w... w... were to go again, would you see me off?
You know, when a soldier g... g... goes to the army...... and his mother prepares... you c... c... could...... not like a mother, but like someone c... c... close.
I don' t mean close like a g... g... girlfriend...... just like a f... f... friend.
There' s 5 minutes of tape.
I had trouble getting Mileta to take the day off.
Don' t worry, it' s all under control.
You know where to pick it up tomorrow.
Sergei.
What are you up to?
I never ask you where you' re going...... but you always tell me.
And now you won' t tell me.
Oh, fucking hell...
- What' s up, Bosiljka?
Didn' t I tell you everything was under control?
Trust me.
- That I don' t screw up, huh?
You have to have the last word.
Everything' s going to be blown up.
Any second now.
Or even 10.
Come on, love.
Find me those negatives and hurry off home.
I' ve got to ring Mileta.
Guys, don' t do that.
I shouldn' t be telling you this, but OK.
Mileta' s gone to church.
And you know what that means?
Do you want to tell me where you' re taking him?
To the Military Hospital.
But I must call Mileta.
- On his own.
Go on then, ring him.
On your own head be it.
Go on, ring him.
I have to.
- You have to?
Look, I' ve got to go.
Bye!
Stars?!
Poison is more likely!
He nearly died.
Well what do you fucking want?
Success.
Bye Harvey.
Sell the flat, half of it goes into this account in Germany; to my wife and the rest to my secretary.
Bosa?
Yeah, she' s the one.
They' il need money for the film.
Is the tape machine ready?
- What tape machine?
You want my tape machine?
I' il look after it, don' t worry.
You know what it' s been through?
I know, all the war films.
Bosa will bring it back tomorrow.
Did you hear that Milosevic would sign peace agreement?
I heard.
- Yeah, beautiful.
It survived this war as well.
It' s just a shame I' il never come back here.
Listen to him.
- Sergei got away from us.
You lying bastard!
He' s worse than us!
He' s a greater liar than us!
What' s up?
What do you mean he recorded his own death?
How can a dead man film his own death?
Mileta, sir, just to let you know.
I didn' t allow it.
Get a team and arrest anything that moves.
But not before I give the sign.
This looks like a good spot to burn a film tonight.
And Mileta can 't put this fire out.
Mileta 's a silly little policeman shit.
To be or not to be, that is the question, I do believe.
I hope the American bustards are on time this evening.
It 's coming with me.
Only angels will be able to watch it.
Bye.
Dule, listen to me.
This should be the last scene of a film you must shoot about Djole, Aca, me and our stupid lives.
You 've got everything the story, war, laughter, politics, emotions, and a good ending.
With a victor who gets killed in front of cameras.
Just don 't be sentimental, Dule.
And Bosa, don 't cry.
It 'il be your greatest film.
Thank you all for coming in such great numbers.
We were seeing pictures of tragic dead of our friend.
Our enemies say they have intelligent bombs that strike only selected targets.
They destroyed one life, one film that wanted to show the truth to the world.
Sergei, rest in peace.
Bosa, run it once more.
What do you mean there' s no body?
There were several powerful explosions, not from above.
He used dynamite, probably strapped to his body.
And this film is ruined.
Carry on looking.
I' m sure you' il find something.
Go on, don' t stand around.
Have you found something?
Dule, listen to me.
This should be the last scene of a film you must shoot about Djole, Aca, me and our stupid lives.
You 've got everything...
You 've got a protagonist, an antagonist, you' ve got politics, war, and me as the victor who gets killed in front of cameras.
I hope these shits won 't be late.

LONERS
When I was a kid I thought cats were female dogs.
And I thought turtle- doves were female pigeons.
And I thought weasels were female badgers.
You' re insane.
And I thought men and women were two different species.

- So you were in Bangkok?
- Yup.
- Tell me about it.
- What do you want to know?
- I hear whores are in aquariums.
- Yup, and they' re usually naked.
- How much do they go for?
A blow job is 0500 Thai baths.
That' s the same in Czech crowns.
A fuck is 500 or 1000.
Sometimes you can get both for a grand.
- What about kissing?
- Kissing?
That' s most expensive of all.
It’ il run you at least 2500.
- You didn' t know that?
- I guess I forgot.
Tell me about this girl.
The girl you' re about to meet is absolutely one of a kind.
She' s modest, intelligent, but mostly she' s self- sacrificing.
- A pretty rare combination.
- Is she seeing anyone now?
Every girl' s seeing someone unless she' s seeing you.
Or should I say, me.
I don' t get...
- why you want to meet this girl.
- 'Cause our relationship' s shaky.
This might be worth filming.
- It was a joke.
- A stupid one.
- Okay if I film you arguing?
- We' re not going to argue.
- Are you mental?
- Hang on.
I thought you said your relationship was shaky.
- Think that' s funny?
- You' re really pushing it.
Wait a minute.
All I did was help you realize you' ve come to a dead- end.
Thanks.
My consciously acting like a swine has cleansed you.
I' ve pointed out how ridiculous your lives are.
- Next time we need something...
- We’ il definitely let you know.
You wanted to know if she was the right girl for you.
That means I' m not.
- Then let’ s do something.
- Like what?
- All we can do is flip a coin.
- What are you talking about?
Heads we stay together, tails we break up.
Okay.
I’ il flip.
- You mean you' d actually do it?
- It was your idea.
Isn' t it odd for two grown people to decide whether or not to break up by flipping a coin?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Come on in.
Awesome pad.
Don' t turn it off.
Awesome tune.
What is it?
- The national anthem, bonehead.
- Oh, yeah.
I haven' t heard the instrumental version lately, so I forgot it.
- Is there something you want?
- Huh?
- You want something?
- Yeah, of course.
It' s in my car.
Do you know they got monkeys dealing drugs in Thailand?
- What kind of monkeys?
- Gibbons.
- How could they do that?
- Like anyone else.
They deliver packages and collect money just like you do.
Hang on.
Are you implying I' m a monkey?
Let me tell you something, pal.
You' re a total burn- out.
- You' re thirty years old...
- Who cares?
You' re a loser.
You quit school, you work as a moving man...
You' re constantly stoned, and you hardly know your own name.
Hey, you' re right.
I am thirty.
Meanwhile you could be the master of your own destiny.
You could play an active role in the story of your life.
You keep smoking weed and you’ il be a basket case by 35.
Or you come to your senses, and take hold of your destiny.
- There is some truth to that.
- It' s entirely up to you.
What do you think I should do?
Cocaine.
- Holy shit!
- Promise you’ il think about it.
I can do that.
What do I want you to do?
Think about it!
Okay.
I’ il think about it.
- Are you serious about me?
- You bet.
- Sure this isn' t just about sex?
- Excuse me?
We just met.
I don' t even know your sign.
- What is your sign?
- Does it matter?
- Would you be a Capricorn?
- Why?
They don' t like saying what sign they are.
- Then I' m a Capricorn.
- You are?
That' s good.
- What can I get you?
- A Rapid and...
A regular shot for055 or a „ body shot “ for 155?
- A regular shot.
What' s a body shot?
You put salt behind your ear, lemon...
I' d have to show you.
Then show us.
I' d have to demonstrate...
-... on her.
- Go ahead, then.
I' m no guinea pig.
Find someone else, okay?
I' m all sticky!
- What time do you get off work?
- You two will be asleep by then.
That' s my sister.
Dear friends, back in prep school...
Back in high school...
Would you mind if we had a few people over?
Of course not.
- Travel agency clients.
- Czechs?
- No, more like Japanese.
- Japanese again!
They want to see how a typical Czech family lives.
How do you envision this?
Will we have to wear costumes?
Will I have to act like a fool or dress up as a plumber?
Why would you have to dress up as a plumber?
I don' t know.
- Did I say, „ as a plumber? “ - Yes, you did.
That was just one way I could make a fool of myself.
You won' t have to do that.
They’ il watch us eat, walk the dog...
Do we have a dog?
We could borrow one.
Nothing against the Japanese, but our family is sacred to me.
Our family is a private matter.
- I don' t want tourists eyeing us.
- Very nicely put.
Dear friends...
That' s it.
Some years ago...
A break- up?
You leave a piece of your soul with everyone you break up with.
The missing piece is what hurts.
Because it' s not with you.
Eventually it comes back to you, but it takes a long time.
Sometimes I see blue lights on people.
They' re pieces of the souls of people who used to love you.
Sometimes they' re the hopes your parents had for you.
That' s the second kind.
Everyone' s covered with lights.
Really.
The Japanese have even invented a way to measure it.
- The Japanese, huh?
- They know how to measure it.
- Why don' t I drive instead?
- Why?
I' m fine.
- Really?
I understand.
It can mess up your short- term memory.
But it can help your long- term one.
Holy shit!
Don' t move him!
His spine could be messed up.
- He' s pinned in here.
- Shouldn' t we call an ambulance?
- I used to drive an ambulance.
- Really?
- Really.
- We' re not moving him, right?
- Of course not.
I' m just looking at the way he' s pinned in there.
- We' re not moving him, right?
- No.
His spine could be messed up.
Some years ago my girlfriend left me.
I was so upset that I would have done anything just to see her.
I even dressed up as a plumber to get into her apartment.
For two years I followed her around and walked by her house.
- I left flowers on her doorstep.
- His idea of an atypical speech.
Yet I knew something complex and mysterious was guiding me.
My brain.
I devoted it to the human brain.
Thank you, Professor.
Tonight proves you didn' t make such a bad choice.
- Excuse me, I have an emergency.
- I understand.
Such is the life of a neurosurgeon.
In recent years neurosurgery has made great strides...
We can move my stuff tomorrow, Jakub.
Will you come pick me up?
Now we’ il apply...
- Do you have that?
- Yes, I do.
This is Petr.
This band will be coming to Prague...
And now for a new contest called „ Record Your Mother. “
Send me tapes of your mothers for all our listeners to hear.
Now for something I think is really good.
You go to bars and you look like a druggie.
And those friends of yours...
You got sick of her so you sent her packing.
- Some boyfriend you are!
- That' s not him.
- He' s just helping me move.
- Then go on in.
- I' ve never met your friends.
- It was Petr.
You know him.
That Petr?
I knew he' d send you packing from the minute I saw him.
Why isn' t Petr helping you if he sent you packing?
He didn' t send me packing.
We just broke up.
Some life you lead.
Listen to that cough.
It' s that lifestyle of yours again.
- It' s from the air here.
At our house?
- No, the Prague air.
- It' s that lifestyle of yours!
And those friends of yours, for Christ' s sake.
Keep your hands off her!
You let everyone touch you.
- Goodbye.
- I’ il just be staying for a few nights.
- No problem.
- Hi, Dad.
- We' re glad you' re here.
- I don' t get it.
Why are you like this when Dad and I are so happy?
- I' m not all that happy.
- Yes, you are.
Happy is what she will never be!
- Have his relatives been by?
- No.
Strangers brought him in.
Let me see that.
Are these their names?
- Yes.
Do you know them?
- No, why?
Never heard of them.
On the contrary.
Doctor?
I' m sorry.
- This apartment looks fine.
- It' s too luxurious.
- And the lady in South Prague?
- She lives alone.
It' s sad to say, but yours is the only typical family around.
We will not perform for anyone.
This doesn' t belong here, but this girl is interesting.
- Could they go to her house?
- No, to her parents' house.
She has excellent parents.
Her mother' s especially crazed.
And they' d go for it.
Listen, I' ve got to go.
Take it easy.
Bye!
- Hi, Ondrej!
- What a coincidence!
Hanka!
- What are you doing here?
- I have a meeting.
- What are you up to?
- Great!
- How about your boyfriend?
- We' re still together.
I' m glad to hear that.
- I heard him on the radio.
- Really?
I listen to him on the radio sometimes.
Can I give you a hug?
- A hug?
- Just as friends.
Sure.
Some time ago I made a private agreement with God.
That I' d become a doctor on account of you.
And once I' d saved enough lives, God would give you back to me.
Oh...
Last night I operated on the man you brought in.
- Did you?
How is he?
- Fine.
- What kind of sign?
I don' t know yet, but it seemed like a sign.
I operated on the same person you brought to the hospital.
- That surely is a sign!
- A sign we should live together.
- Come off it!
It was just a joke.
I wasn' t really serious.
I just wanted to...
- I have to go.
- Fine.
- Take it easy, bye.
- Bye!
That was not good.
I should' ve left God out of it.
That was not good.
So you want me to pretend I' m your girlfriend?
Exactly.
Mom would be really happy.
She' s really attached to me.
- It wouldn' t be right.
- She wants me to live well.
- Don' t you live well?
- I live like a pig.
- A pig?
- Don' t you have a girlfriend?
- Nope.
Couldn' t someone else do this?
The point is that I look good.
I' m faithful to you.
You respect me.
Get it?
Do I say we' re getting married?
You can say you liked my screenplay.
- You wrote a screenplay?
- Not yet, but you can say that.
Hi, patient!
So this is Mom, and this is Vesna.
- Hello.
- She' s my girlfriend.
I' m faithful to her.
We love each other.
- Does he still drink a lot?
He' s improved.
Are you still a Buddhist?
Why haven' t you visited me?
- I was in Bangkok.
- Where?
- In Bangkok.
- It' s in Thailand.
- Did you sleep with prostitutes?
- No, I was writing a screenplay.
- A screenplay?
- It' s very good.
Really?
See?
He never lets me read anything.
- Did he smoke marijuana there?
- No, he quit.
- He always says no when I offer.
- You offer it to him?
Not anymore.
I quit, too.
He' s a good influence on me.
And on everyone else.
Can I use the bathroom?
- What' s this supposed to mean?
- I needed a way to pick her up.
I said I wanted to cheer you up.
And she' s enjoying it.
- Aren' t you pleased that I' m so playful?
- Not really.
But I get my inability to take things seriously from you.
It didn' t bother you at all when we used to cry as kids.
You told us to cry, that tears are a good oral disinfectant.
- Must you always joke around?
- You' re the one who' s joking.
- You aren' t really sick.
- Will you ever love me?
How can you expect to succeed if nothing is sacred to you?
- Find a steady relationship.
- I' m thinking of buying a dog.
Gary Gilmore was a mass murderer who received the death penalty.
He was also an organ donor, so strangers got his organs.
He had to look at life through Gary Gilmore' s eyes.
No, thanks.
I' m not interested.
Hello.
- Yeah, I think so.
- Hang on.
I have to find it.
Here it is.
Hey, I have the same one!
- Goodbye.
- Do you want to go somewhere?
- Like where?
- Out for a drink?
- No, I don' t.
- Can I kiss you?
- Yup.
- Isn' t there an extra charge?
- For what?
I thought kissing was the most expensive.
I have no idea.
I guess that' s just in Bangkok.
- You were in Bangkok?
- You bet.
- Really?
- Yup.
- Tell me about it.
- The whores are in aquariums.
Cool.
How much do girls charge for tricks?
- Fellatio' s 500.
- What?
A blow job.
Intercourse costs 500 or maybe 1000.
Sometimes you can get both for 1000 baths.
That' s the same in Czech crowns.
And kissing costs the most.
It' s at least 2500.
- 2500?
- You didn' t know that?
Nope.
Did you?
Let' s not waste time chatting.
That' s intense.
Slow down.
Unbelievable...
None of my friends could ever be President.
- Are those people your friends?
- Yup.
- Ice?
- Nope.
They' re all my friends, and they' re all living a lie.
They' re lucky I' m around to point that out to them.
That' s my project.
- Who' s that girl?
- A friend.
Why?
- Do you know her family?
Pretty loony.
- In what way?
She acts like my mom.
Why?
So you all know each other here.
Why are you in this country?
On account of UFOs.
- UFOs.
- Yup.
The soil here is good, so they can fly low.
- Can' t they do that anywhere else?
- Nope.
You' re insane!
I' ve never asked a girl this before, but what' s your sign?
I was walking down an odd street...
and I had the feeling I was in a foreign city like Tokyo, Japan
I' ve never been to Tokyo, but I imagine it' s a cold place.
- And that' s how I feel today.
- Gee, what happened?
This song' s about what' s inside me today.
- Are you coming to bed?
- You can turn off the light.
I broke up with my girlfriend because...
Because we' re both looking for someone who won' t go looking for somebody else.
And until we find that person, we’ il keep looking on our own.
I guess there' s no solution.
But that doesn' t matter.
That doesn' t matter...
What?
My back hurts, so I' m working out the kinks...
You really scared us, you fool.
It' s a miracle you' re alive, but the doctors here are good.
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Morning.
- I don' t have a brother.
You operated on him yesterday.
- How can I ever repay you?
- That' s quite all right.
- Medicine fascinates me.
- It' s just a job like any other.
- What do you do?
- I' m a magician.
- Really?
- I can show you a trick.
- This is not the right place.
It’ il only take a second.
What' s in your pocket?
- Here.
- Watch closely.
Stop moving your hands around.
Goodness, I' ve got to run.
This is for you.
That' s my card.
Come see my magic show.
Thank you.
Hi!
- What a coincidence.
- It certainly is.
- What' re you doing here?
- I was at the library.
How are you?
I heard you and your boyfriend broke up.
- Where' d you hear that?
- On the radio.
We might get back together.
It was wise you lied to me.
You thought I' d go bananas again
like when I used to put on disguises and follow you around.
I was thinking more of the time you almost set us on fire.
- On fire?
What do you mean?
- You heard me!
Oh, that.
That was just a joke.
That was no joke!
Don' t you remember?
Do you think I' d really set you on fire?
I' m not insane.
I think you are!
Wait!
Can I give you a hug?
No, you' d better not.
- We must stop seeing each other.
- I was thinking that myself.
- Even „ by chance. “ - You can say that again.
Call me if you need help moving.
I take it back.
- Anything else you want?
- Then I' m off.
- Bye...
Vesna isn' t just a great girl who knows how to summon UFOs.
More importantly, she' s a master of the body shot.
Show him!
- That' s not a good idea.
- I agree.
- I' m more interested in UFOs.
- Body shots are better.
You' re a DJ, and you don' t know what a body shot is?
- I don' t have to know everything.
Put lemon in your mouth, and then Vesna will drink it.
Quit looking at each other!
I thought you were curious.
I am, but Hanka' s on her way.
This is not a good idea.
Okay, you' re right.
Hanka!
Wait!
Sorry.
We were just drinking tequila like they do in Mexico.
- In Mexico, huh?
- They drink it like that there.
- It comes from cactuses.
- Why did you ask me here?
It occurred to me that the guy you took to the hospital...
-... could' ve been a sign.
- What kind of sign?
I don' t know.
But it' s odd you found him the night you moved out.
That is odd.
Maybe it was a sign that we should' ve stayed together.
Or that we shouldn' t have.
Or that we shouldn' t have.
A tequila sunrise and a body shot of tequila.
Do you know what a body shot is?
Honest.
I collect this stuff.
- You collect guitar picks?
- I collect all sorts of stuff.
Will you go with me?
He’ il be more likely to give you the pick if you' re alone.
Anyway, he kept looking at you.
- I’ il wait here for you, okay?
- So, a guitar pick, right?
- And I want it autographed.
- Fine.
Hi.
On a guitar pick.
What time do you get off work?
- Everyone' s covered with lights.
- Lights?
Me, too?
Well...
To be honest, not really.
That' s good.
Isn' t it?
It means that no one loves you.
Your cell phone' s ringing.
Why don' t you answer it?
But I don' t have a cell phone.
Hello?
You bet.
I wanted to go, but it slipped my mind.
Sure I’ il bring one.
See you.
If I understand correctly, Vesna promised her boyfriend a pick.
That' s why who' s here?
That' s why I' m here.
Forge a famous guitarist' s autograph.
Is that correct?
Yup.
- Did I do a good job?
- It looks great.
My pleasure.
What do I owe you?
- The guys said you' re interested in UFOs.
- Yup.
- Do you think they land here?
- No, but they fly close to here.
Do they?
If you hear about anything, I' d love to go with you.
- I' m not sure.
- Why not?
Why couldn' t people watch UFOs from a delivery truck here?
A travel agency, get it?
Prague Castle in the afternoon, and UFOs at night.
- No, you don' t have to.
Thanks for offering.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Can I come in?
- Sure.
I wanted to introduce you two, anyway.
Monika!
Bartender Monika, meet bartender Vesna.
- Is she your sister?
- No.
Does she look like my sister?
You' re disgusting.
No, I' m not.
I like you, but everyone does this.
- This is what you do.
- This is just life.
- Your life.
There' s nothing sad about it.
Vesna!
I have to get this on film.
- Relax...
- You' re an idiot!
Hang on...
Czechs are nasty to each other because Czech language is nasty.
Czech is stupid.
The sounds are harsh, and it' s complicated.
- It' s all „ perhaps, “ „ if “...
- “ Could “ and „ would. “
No one knows how to say what they like to say.
- Would like to say.
- Would like to say.
- And everyone tells lies.
- They don' t smoke enough pot.
- Do you think that' s why?
- If they did, they' d lie less.
Maybe they' d break up less.
Getting high isn' t part of our culture yet.
Maybe you' re right.
I just know this country is fucked up.
That' s for sure.
Then again, every country is.
- You can leave your shoes on.
- Really?
- Hello!
- Did Hanka send you?
- No, this was my idea.
- Did you hear what Petr did?
- No.
- He sent her packing.
- Did he?
- Pretty cruel of him.
- I' d say so.
- May I videotape your house?
- Of course.
- I' m sorry.
- That' s all right.
I’ il just turn this on...
- Is this for television?
- No.
I' m from a travel agency.
We specialize in Japan.
Japanese tourists want to see how typical Czechs live.
- Would they come to our house?
- Yes, with an interpreter.
If you' re interested we can go upstairs.
Follow me.
- Who?
The two of us?
Do you talk during meals?
- Yes, a little.
- We talk a lot.
We' ve had some quiet applicants.
That' s not what we want.
Right, Dad?
- Do you have a dog?
- No.
- No problem.
We’ il provide one.
Get small dog that doesn' t shed much.
Hanka' s staying in this bedroom now.
And here' s the bathroom.
Excellent.
You could walk the dog, watch some TV.
We could do that.
- But the focus will be on food.
- What do you mean?
- I' d say we' re going to eat.
- Exactly.
The Japanese want to know how typical Czechs act during meals.
Come in.
- Am I disturbing you?
Come in.
At the hospital you offered to pay me back.
- And the offer still stands.
- Now there is something I need.
What is it?
No, I' m sorry.
How would I do that?
No, that wouldn' t work.
For my next trick I need a volunteer from the audience.
Sir, why don' t you come up here?
Don' t worry.
Come right up.
Get inside.
You’ il be fine.
Perhaps.
This is...
I’ il shut the door.
- Am I to believe he disappeared?
- It sounds silly, doesn' t it?
- It sure does.
- This is a very bad joke.
Ondrej has never pulled silly stunts like this.
I am not leaving until you give me my husband back.
Good afternoon.
- May I help you?
- Are you Mrs. Cerna?
- Yes.
I' ve come to inspect your gas appliances.
The gate' s open.
- Thank you, ma' am.
Stop making those awful faces!
Are they even going to watch me shave?
We can still cancel out.
When you think about it, we could prevent wars.
- In Kosovo, say?
- Doubtful.
But if the Americans had visited Vietnamese families,
- there wouldn' t have been a war.
- Wars break my heart.
I can' t bear to see those children and poor people.
And meanwhile we are so happy.
- I' m not all that happy.
- Yes, you are.
Happy is what those people will never be.
- Is everything all right?
- I didn' t even offer you a drink.
- Do I owe you anything?
- No, these inspections are free.
- Fine.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Did we have company?
- No.
- How do you explain the flowers in my room?
- Which flowers?
- I don' t believe it.
- Actually, the gas man was here.
- What did he want?
- He came to inspect the stove.
But we don' t have a gas stove.
Hello?
Ondrej?
Not having a gas stove is no reason to get hysterical.
„ Record Your Mother. “
Back to our contest.
A friend of mine likes surprising me.
Sometimes it' s quite unpleasant, but now I’ il surprise him.
Recently he gave me a tape of his mother.
A big hello to you and your mom!
I' ve improved.
For example, I go by garbage cans without taking anything.
- Really?
Last time someone threw away a high power vacuum cleaner.
- Are you recording this?
- Yup.
- That' s good.
- Do you have anything to drink?
Otherwise I wouldn' t try...
I left a high power vacuum cleaner there.
- I see.
- I didn' t even look at it.
How do you know it was a high power vacuum?
- There was a grinder here.
- Where' s the wine?
- Did you see the grinder?
- Nope.
It was in a box and there were some new boots on top of it.
Brand new.
That' s how I knew the vacuum was good.
And I didn' t look at it or the boots.
Because I knew God was just tempting me.
- Move over.
- Why do you collect this junk?
My son is a disappointment and I want to be remembered for something.
You' re such a klutz.
Would you go with them?
I’ il shoot the breeze with them.
It' s awesome here.
- Think so?
- You bet.
There are forty- two civilizations in the universe, and we' re in last place.
Measured by what?
- Moral maturity...
- Yeah.
We' re also the only planet where procreation requires only two beings.
So on the other planets you need three beings?
Of various sexes.
So we' d need four more beings of totally different sexes.
Right.
Then maybe I will go.
Why are we here, anyway?
- I guess we' re waiting for UFOs.
- Right.
I forgot something in the car.
Why are we here, anyway?
You don' t really believe in UFOs.
- Maybe not.
- Then why are you in Prague?
I came here to see Dad.
Your Dad?
- Yup.
- Is he in this country?
Yup.
- Does he know about you?
- Nope.
Want to tell me about it?
Nope.
And I don' t want to start anything until I see him.
Even though I like you.
Understand?
Of course.
At times it' s easier to see a UFO than your own dad.
He' s from the Czech Republic, and she' s never seen him before.
So now I' m going to play some Macedonian music.
Because at times it' s easier to see a UFO than to live with the kind of girl I lived with for three years.
Why did you live with me if it was that horrible?
- Sorry, we were stoned.
- You can' t always make excuses.
- I' m not.
- Know what your problem is?
You' ve never done anything for anyone.
You' ve never given up anything you like for anyone.
Would you get a degree for someone?
- For you?
- This isn' t about me.
- Then who is this about?
- Would you give up anything at all?
- Of course.
Something really important?
Do you want me to jump off a bridge for you?
No, I just wanted you to be brave about our break- up.
So I' d have a reason to respect you so I could come back to you.
So you wanted to come back to me because I broke up with you?
- Yeah.
- That' s great.
You' re just like your mother.
What?
As Station Manager I am responsible for what you play.
I don' t care about your break- up or your contest.
Tell me why you play this stuff.
My mother is ten times worse than what you' ve been playing.
Radio is no private matter.
If I hear this stuff again, you can pack it in.
Get it?
Yes.
I was afraid we' d never meet again.
Nah, I knew we would.
How did you know that?
Because the guy pinned in the car was a sign.
A sign?
We find a guy pinned in his car the first time we meet.
He was pinned in a car he' d rolled.
Didn' t that seem like a sign to you?
Yeah, I guess so.
It' s a clear sign that something' s going on between us.
The fact that you' re high is a sign you shouldn' t be driving.
Get a load of these buildings.
Aren' t they awesome?
What city is this?
Dubrovnik?
- This is Prague, you moron.
I was just testing you.
This is where I live.
But today it seems new.
It' s really nice.
Tourists flip out over these buildings.
You can rip me off just like you do to tourists.
It sounds like you' re saying he steals.
- So you really steal, huh?
- Knock it off.
Why?
It' s awesome.
Where' s he going?
How can he drive from out there?
Ouch!
The Golden Age of Moving is coming.
More and more people are moving to more and more new places.
I' m afraid of how it’ il turn out.
But I' m not getting in the way.
I want to move with the times!
- A mover.
- You already are one.
Then I’ il keep my job!
My sincere condolences...
Wow!
Awesome hose.
- My condolences.
- Do I know you?
I' m Ondrej.
Of course, Lenka' s husband.
She' s looking for you.
Come in.
Look at all the junk Mom had.
It' s that psychopath again.
He keeps following me around.
- Then we’ il get him stoned.
- He doesn' t smoke.
- Does he eat?
- Why wouldn' t he?
Then I’ il put it in some food.
This is my sister Julie.
He' s a doctor.
I don' t have to introduce you.
This is Jakub, a great musician.
- Hi, I' m Jakub.
- Do you want something to drink?
Coffee?
- No, thanks.
Do you have any pastry or cake?
Isn' t cake more for weddings?
Do you have any mixes?
We must.
I want to bake something.
Ondrej, I don' t know how to get through to you.
You' ve made a mess of your life, haven' t you?
I' m offering you a way out.
What way?
What can you offer me?
You' re a psychopath!
Don' t touch me!
You' re an addicted psychopath!
Life with a psychopath might be your only way out.
Or are you looking for someone who’ il leave you in a year?
Please!
I love you more than anything.
I know I act like an idiot.
That' s because of you.
I think of you when I' m walking down the street, at work...
I can' t help it.
I think of you in so many places that I can' t even name them all.
I went to medical school so you would be proud of me.
I sometimes wish you' d fracture your thigh in a car accident...
- Don' t touch me!
- Please!
- Don' t touch me!
- Hanka, I' m begging you!
That' s heavy stuff.
I understand you.
I' m a wreck, too.
Can I give you a hug?
- Me?
- Just as friends.
What are you staring at?
I always stare like this.
He asked.
- I wanted to answer him.
- But you were looking at me.
So I was looking at you instead of at him.
Whatever.
- What did you bake?
- Some excellent pastry.
I just want to sit down.
Some party.
- I' d like something to drink.
- We have some excellent pastry.
- What is this?
- Nothing.
- Did you set us on fire?
- No, I didn' t.
- But we' re burning!
- No, you aren' t.
Everything' s just fine.
- Holy shit!
This is warped!
This is unreal!
Wasn' t it?
Please...
I love you.
I think of you in so many places that I can' t even name them all.
I love you more than anything.
Why did you film this?
I found it interesting.
Interesting?
Yup.
- It seems sad to me.
- It is sad.
I find sad things fascinating.
Without sadness I feel nothing, and I can' t change.
- That' s quite sad, isn' t it?
- Yes, but it' s also fascinating.
You are a real idiot.
„ I' m sorry, Hanka “
Scram!
We all need relationships.
Someone who loves you.
Someone who’ il caress you when you' re down.
The world might be awesome, but sometimes it stinks.
And Hanka' s sensitive.
She' s totally awesome.
I told her I love her and I want to live with her.
Live with her?
You already have a girlfriend.
- Say what?
- C' mon, Alice.
- Alice who?
- You tell me.
I wouldn' t...
Oh yeah, Alice.
But we broke up.
No, you didn' t.
But we saw her off at the train station.
She just went to Germany to see her aunt.
You' re a total waste case.
You can' t even remember who you' re going out with.
Do you even know your own name?
Listen, quit smoking pot.
Do you want me to go schizo?
„ I’ il wait for you “
I have to tell you something.
I thought we' d start going out, but the guys said I already had a girlfriend.
- Which guys?
- From the band.
Then it all came back to me.
I' d totally forgotten about her.
- You' re joking, right?
I know it' s awful.
I' m sorry, but put yourself in my place.
Everything has turned against us.
I love you, but I promised to stay with her.
I remember making that decision.
- I don' t want to hurt anyone.
- You don' t want to hurt anyone?
- I' m sorry.
- It' s all that pot you smoke!
It' s that lifestyle of yours!
This is the last thing I' m gonna play for you.
This is also the last tape I have of my girlfriend.
This is her cough from March 3, 1997.
You can see how long we were together.
I guess we hurt each other.
But in any event...
Here' s a beautiful cough.
Where have you been?
We started without you.
Where have you been?
We started without you.
Come on.
Sit down.
- What is this?
- Beef.
- With cranberries.
I' m not hungry.
This is beef.
Have some more dumplings.
They want to see how we eat.
Isn' t this in the contract?
- Can I talk to you in private?
- Later, okay?
The father is indicating that they can talk later.
What the hell is this?
What' s she saying?
- Watch your language!
- Stop snapping at me!
The daughter is surprised by the unusual situation.
I' m not afraid to slap you!
I came to see you because I feel awful and I need to talk to you.
Yet what do I find here?
Do you know why you feel awful?
It' s that lifestyle of yours.
The daughter wants advice on how
to deal with the fact that a married man is stalking her.
- It those friends of yours.
- You don' t even know them.
Seeing them is enough.
Isn' t it odd for a girl your age to move all the time?
Quiet!
- Seeing you breaks my heart.
- You break my heart too, Mom.
Stop it!
This is unbearable.
The parents object to having this kind of discussion today.
Kindly realize that life isn' t that easy.
- I see.
- What?
You have an obligation.
We' ve had to make sacrifices.
Well I have, out of love!
You don' t even know what that means because your friends...
-... never make sacrifices for you.
- I don' t want them to!
And they don' t!
You people don' t live life.
You just slice it!
The mother thinks the daughter is to blame for her own problems.
I like women as people.
I' m just not going to sleep with them anymore.
If I ever do meet a girl, for the first 146 days we' re just going to talk.
146 days.
That' s important.
It can' t be less than that.
Then maybe I’ il give her a kiss.
But until I find that kind of girl I' m going to be alone.
Not everyone has the chance to be alone like I have.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Have you already started?
- Did you wash your hands?
- Yes.
- I saw the video.
- Which video?
From Robert' s party.
I was quite shocked.
It was just an ordinary party.
You have a few drinks, and then act crazy.
You dance and laugh.
Should I pack my things?
Of course not.
Have a seat.
I think we have a good relationship.
- Do you?
- Of course.
You buy us nice Christmas gifts.
You don' t smoke or drink.
You' re faithful to me, reliable.
And you love us.
- Do you think so?
- Of course you love us.
- Yes, I did.
Sometimes it' s hard to figure out what you want on your own.
You think you want to live with someone else.
Yet what you really want is to dress up as a plumber.
Why, that' s me.
I didn' t know the problem was your attraction to overalls.
You can wear them at home.
Thanks, but I don' t think that' s the main problem.
Perhaps the hospital would even let you wear them to work.
Well, maybe.
- But promise you’ il think about it.
Fine, I’ il think about it.
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.
Bon appetit!
I get high because the world is cruel and people are lonely.
I work so I can buy drugs that make people seem kind, friendly, free, and beautiful.
Trouble is these drugs probably caused me to hurt someone.
So it doesn' t make sense for me to do them anymore.
I' ve had it with drugs.
I' m giving up weed.
This is my last joint.
I' m not even going to finish it.
- What' s she like?
- She' s a bit selfish and tough, and she never gives up without a fight.
- Is it even worth the effort?
Give it a try.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Pretty good, huh?
It occurred to me that the guy I took to the hospital...
- What kind of sign?
I' m popular to boot
I' m bitchin ', great hair[ br]
I' m wanted, I' m hot[ br]
I' m pretty, I' m cool[ br]
I dominate this school
Who am I, just guess[ br]
Guys wanna touch my chest
I' m rockin ', I smile[ br]
I' m flyin ', I jump[ br]
I' m major, I roar[ br]
We act like we' re on speed
Hate us' cause we' re beautiful[ br]
Well, we don' t like you either
We' re cheerleaders[ br]
We are cheerleaders[ br]
Uh- huh
- Call me Big Red [br]
- I' m Wh- Wh- Whitney
- C- C- C- Courtney, reow [br]
- Dude, it' s Darcy
- I' m Big Bad Carver, yeah [br]
- Just call me Kasey
I' m still Big Red
But now I pass the torch
The ballots are in[ br] and one girl had to win
She' s perky, she' s fun[ br] and now she' s number one
K- K- Kick it, Torrance[ br]
T- T- T- Torrance
I' m strong and I' m loud[ br]
I' m gonna make you proud
I' m T- T- T- Torrance[ br]
Your captain Torrance
Let' s go, Toros
We are the Toros[ br]
The fi ghting, mighty Toros
We' re so terrific[ br] we must be Toros
[br]
- Yeah!
- Go, Toros!
Serves herright!
Oh, shit.
[br]
Mr. And Mrs. "S."
Oh, look, it' s Aaron.
Hello, Aaron.
- Hey, can I help?
[br]
Stay in your vehicle.
You sure?
Bye, honey.
Hi.
[br]
- Bye- bye!
[Engine Revving]
Remember, [br] he' s leaving for college.
Right.
- So areyou excited?
- Oh, yeah!
It' s college, Tor.
I' m really stoked, [br] you know?
It' sjust, you know, [br]
I' m gonna miss you.
[br]
Yeah.
But next year, it' il be[ br] you and me reunited at[ br]
Cal State Dominguez Hills.
Yup.
It' ilbe[ br] just like high school, [br] only better.
Dorm rooms.
Okay.
I got the door, Tor.
Hey, what up, buddy?
[br]
- Don' tjinx me.
- Hi, Torrance.
Hey, Aaron.
- Good luck at school.
Oh, Aaron, come[ br] to one last practice?
You knowyou' re still[ br] my favorite cheerleader.
[br]
[br]
Hey.
But I really want...
Bye.
[br]
Oh, yeah.
Darcy thinks she should[ br] get captain 'cause her dad[ br] pays for everything.
He should use[ br] some ofthat money[ br] to buy her a clue.
Theguys love[ br] clutching herbutt.
She' s got a lot to hang on to.
[br]
On one person, I mean.
She puts the "ass" [br] in "massive."
Yo!
Can I have[ br] all your votes?
Here' s me.
We should get Big Red a gift, [br] or at least someone[ br] should say something.
[br]
Good riddance.
[br]
It' s not brown- nosing.
[br]
Both ofyousuckedbefore[ br] she whippedyou into shape.
[br]
[br]
She puts the "itch" in "bitch."
You know, [br] it' s her last practice.
How would you feel?
Big Red[ br] has no feelings.
Just testicles.
Youguys are all[ br] great athletes.
Thanks in large part to me.
leading you to the record[ br] sixth national... cheerleading championship[ br] you know is yours.
So, let' s meet[ br] your new leader,
- Torrance Shipman.
- [Screaming]
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- That slut.
Listen up!
What' s a wolf' s wall?
Only the hardest pyramid[ br] known to cheerleading[ br] and mankind.
The words[ br] "big" and "britches" [br] come to mind.
She' il kill us all.
Some of us have[ br] not spent the entire[ br] summer working out.
[br]
Let' s be different for once.
[br]
Maybe a laurel' s[ br] a good place to rest.
[br]
[br]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... [br]
Five, six, seven, eight.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Stick it!
Five, six, seven, eight.
- Good job!
- Carver, can you cradle out?
- You bet I can.
Okay, ready?
One, two, down, up!
[br]
[Thud]
I' il be back to practice[ br] tomorrow, so don' t you guys fret, [br] okay?
And I don' t want you[ br] to worry at all, [br] because I' m a quick healer.
[br]
[Muffled]
You hearme?
Guys?
I got captain.
Yeah, and you sent[ br] a girl to the hospital[ br] on your fi rst day.
Mom!
She reallyshould[ br] get herown private line, [br] you know.
She' s growing up so fast.
Justin, go away.
At ease, Captain.
You should be happy about that.
Why can' t you[ br] accept the fact[ br] that I' m not a genius?
No.
It kills me that you[ br] barely make time to study.
lfyoustudied[ br] halfasmuch asyou cheer, [br] you' dbe in greatshape.
Your priorities are... [br]
No!
Those are[ br] your priorities!
I' m just saying that[ br] college might be[ br] less ofa shock... ifyou take an extra lab[ br] or language course[ br] or something.
- What do you think?
- Will Advanced Chem[ br] get you off my back?
Not completely, [br] but it' il help.
Done.
You know, mothers have killed[ br] to get their daughters[ br] on squads.
Everyone, we have[ br] a new student... transferring from[ br]
Mission Hills High School[ br] in LosAngeles.
Please welcome[ br]
Cliff "Pant One."
Pantone.
- Thanks.
Loser!
Loser!
[br]
I mean, what is that, [br] from like the 1900s?
Nobody does that anymore.
I don' t think anybody does.
When I lived in Kentucky... [br]
Did they still do[ br] the loser sneeze in Kentucky?
They had, uh, [br] guns and homemade bombs.
There wasattitude in L. A., [br] but no losersneeze.
I' m pretty sure[ br] the loser sneeze[ br] is officially dead.
- [Sneezes]
Loser!
Nice.
I don' t think[ br] they got the memo[ br] about the loser sneeze.
Uh, no, apparently not.
Cliff.
- Torrance.
- Advanced Chem.
Yikes.
Um, 'fraid so.
Are you intimidated?
Y- Yeah, a little.
- Really?
- No, not really.
So, is that your band[ br] or something?
The Clash?
No, uh...
It' s a British punk band, [br] circa 1977 to 1983- ish.
- Original lineup, anyway.
- How vintage.
Um, so I' il[ br] seeyou aroundthen?
Looks like it.
It' s sexy Leslie... and Jan, Jan, [br] the cheerleading man.
Hey, fags.
Just because we won[ br] more trophies[ br] than you guys, that' s no reason[ br] to go get all malignant.
Malignant this, tool.
[br]
[Laughing]
[br]
Right on!
[br]
Let it go.
They never even won[ br] a single game.
Besides, they' re dicks.
Les, tell me you have[ br]
[br] lfyou have a lab partner[ br] already, I' m screwed.
When, really, it was[ br] the ankle she slammed[ br] into the ground.
Misspelled "leg."
Shut up!
Two G' s.
Apparently, Carver[ br] gets home schooling[ br] for the next three months.
[br]
Replacing her is[ br] gonna be a nightmare.
Well, that' s why you' re[ br] the captain, Captain.
Bring on the tyros, [br] the neophytes[ br] and the dilettanti.
[br]
And you' re still jealous[ br] of my score.
Are we sure Carver' s[ br] not malingering?
Carver will strictly be[ br] cheering in Special Olympics[ br] until March.
I talked to her.
She' s cool with this.
Don' t tell me Carver can[ br] cut school just because she[ br] broke her leg in three places.
[br]
[br]
Tell me we' re not actually[ br] continuing this masquerade[ br] and having tryouts.
Let' s cut the crap[ br] and pick somebody now.
Whitney' s little sisterJamie[ br] is really teeny.
She' il be easy to toss, [br] and she doesn' t give lip.
[br]
Kiss my ass, Jan.
I' d love to.
[br] lfshe' s the best, [br]
But we have to see[ br] everyone.
Ready, okay.
Wait.
[br]
Let me try that again.
That was terrible.
Ready, okay!
[br]
Ready, okay!
Ready, okay!
[br]
Be, be aggressive.
[br]
Anddo lhave to[ br] provide my own uniform?
[Techno]
R- C- H!
[Sobbing]
Toros all the way!
[br]
[Crying]
I' m sorry.
[Classical]
Pretty good.
What' s up?
It' s time to get busy!
So let' s kick this shit[ br] and rock the C. K. [br] offyour panties, yeah.
Give my regards[ br] to Broadway
Remember me[ br] to Herald Square
Excuse me!
What' s with the song?
[br]
- No.
[Heavy Metal]
Okay, uh, [br] any more questions?
I think we' re good.
- Here' s our girl.
- Rancho Carne' s[ br] not all talk
Toros rock
Scream and shout
Toro players work it out
[Clapping Continues]
[br]
I don' t like wearing underwear.
- Thanks!
Where' d you[ br] parkyour Harley?
Tattoos are strictly[ br] verboten.
Sorry.
I got bored during[ br] fourth period.
You needto fill[ br] one ofthese out.
[Scoffs]
Missy, is it?
Okay, before we start, [br]
I' m afraid we' re gonna[ br] needto makesure... you can do[ br] a standing back tuck.
Standard procedure.
Standing back handspring[ br] back tuck okay?
Where' s thisgirlfrom, [br]
- Can she yell?
- We' il tryan oldie.
[br]
Like, totally freak me out!
I mean, right on!
The Torossure are[ br] numberone.
[br]
Your school has no gymnastics team!
[Claps]
Okay, so I' ve never[ br] cheered before.
So what?
Do it.
- Hey!
Missy is bank.
Uh, bankrupt.
We' ve already[ br] so decided onJamie.
[br]
It' s a "cheerocracy."
Torrance, and a pain in my ass!
We already voted.
Besides, Missy[ br] looks like an uber dyke.
[Giggling]
Courtney, I' m the captain.
I' m pulling rank, [br] and you can fall in line or not.
lfwe' re gonna be the best, [br] we have to have the best.
So take a big whiff.
You.
And you.
I mean, hi.
I' m... [br]
A cheerleader.
Uh, yeah.
Wow.
So does Missy live here?
Uh, actually, she moved[ br] back to L. A., yeah.
Something about[ br] evil cheerleaders or... [br]
Look, I' m serious.
We have to get her.
Is her drug dependency[ br] gonna be a problem?
[br]
What doyou want?
I want you on the squad.
[br]
They know it.
Thanks, but no, thanks.
[br]
I mean, I plead[ br] temporary insanity.
See, I' m a hard- core gymnast.
No wayjumping up and down, [br] screaming, "Go, team, go!" [br] is gonna satisfy me.
Sorry.
Not interested.
What are you doing?
Nothin '.
Torrance' s point ofview.
- How do you even know her?
- We' re old friends.
Ever been to[ br] a cheerleading competition?
[br]
- No, not a game.
Those are like[ br] practices for us.
I' m talking about[ br] a tournament.
Wait.
People cheering[ br] cheerleaders?
[br]
Lots of people.
Here' s the deal, Missy.
We' re the shit.
The best.
We have fun, we work hard, [br] and we win national championships.
[br]
Youget to wear[ br] sassy outfits.
You get to yell[ br] like you care[ br] about something.
She' s not the cheering type.
You know what?
Count me in.
Ready, girls?
[br]
[Clapping]
It' s cold in here
I said there must be some[ br]
Toros in the atmosphere
I said brrr[ br]
It' s cold in here
Isaid there must besome[ br]
Torosin the atmosphere
I said oh- ee, oh- ee, oh[ br]
Oh- ee, oh- ee, oh[ br] lce, ice, ice
- Here we go, girls.
Hey, practice isn 't overyet.
Nice recruit, Torrance.
A real captain would' ve[ br] seen what I saw:
[br] a big dykey loser.
What is up?
I went out on a limb foryou, [br] and you bail?
[br]
- What are you talking about?
You ripped off[ br] those cheers.
[br]
All right, that' s it!
Get out ofthe car!
I' m gonna kickyour ass!
Oh, really?
Come on.
You' re in for[ br] a rude awakening.
[br]
What?
No way.
Get in.
Doyourthing, Isis!
I said brrr[ br]
It' s cold in here
There must be some[ br]
Clovers in the atmosphere
I said brrr[ br]
It' s cold in here
There must be some[ br]
Clovers in the atmosphere
I said oh- ee, oh- ee, oh[ br]
Ice, ice, ice
Slow it down[ br]
Oh- ee, oh- ee, oh
Here we go
[Saxophone Playing]
You guys[ br] enjoy the show?
Yes, were[ br] the ethnic festivities[ br] to your liking today?
- Really?
Ready to share[ br] those trophies?
Can wejust beat[ br] these Buffys down[ br] so I can go home?
I' m on curfew, girl.
- There' s no need for that.
- She' s right.
See, then we' d be[ br] doing them a favor.
Then they could feel good[ br] about sending Raggedy Ann here[ br] tojack us for our cheers.
- Raggedy Ann?
- Ugly redhead with a video[ br] camera attached to her hand.
Y' all been coming up here[ br] foryears, trying to steal[ br] our routines.
[br]
- What are you talking about?
I said there must be some[ br]
Toros in the atmosphere "?
I...
[br]
- Finito!
Everytime[ br] we getsome, herey' all come, tryin 'to steal it, [br] puttin' blond hair on it and[ br] calling it something different.
We' ve had the best squad[ br] around foryears, but no one' s been able[ br] to see what we can do.
But you better believe[ br] all that' s gonna change[ br] this year.
I' m captain, and I guarantee you[ br] we' il make it to nationals.
Handoverthe tape[ br] you made tonight and we' il[ br] callit even fornow.
We don' t have any tape.
Wejust came[ br] to see the show.
What?
Let me do this.
You know what?
Let' sgo.
Wait a minute.
So that' s it?
We' rejust gonna let them go?
Yeah, because unlike them, [br] we have class.
I swear I had no idea.
Hmmph.
[br]
Wejust so almost[ br] got our asses kicked[ br] back there!
I mean, I knew I' d seen[ br] those routines before.
East Compton[ br] all the time.
You really had no idea, [br] did you?
Do you know[ br] what this means?
My entire[ br] cheerleading career[ br] has been a lie.
[br]
It' s only cheerleading.
I am only cheerleading.
- Do you believe in curses?
- What are you talking about?
I think I' m cursed.
And why is that?
This past summer[ br] at Cheer Camp, all the new seniors[ br] had to do a dare.
See, there' s this thing[ br] calledtheSpirit Stick, andit can never, [br] evertouch theground.
Torrance Shipman, [br] your mission, should you[ br] choose to accept it... and you better... is to capture[ br] the Spirit Stick... anddrop it in front[ br] ofthe entire camp.
Doyou wannago my way
Well, I just wanted[ br] to congratulate you guys[ br] and take a picture ofyou...
with the Spirit Stick.
Here.
Here.
[br]
- No, it' s okay.
The Spirit Stick[ br] doesn' t lose anything.
[Thunderclap]
I don' t mean to laugh, [br] but cheerleading[ br] urban legends?
[br]
Shit happens.
[br]
I' m on the phone, creep.
I realize that, [br] and normally I' d be[ br] listening on the other line, but this is important.
Okay, what?
[Farts]
Get out!
Yo.
[br]
Is Aaron around?
[br]
[br]
All right.
Big Red totally screwed us!
I mean monster screwed us!
I put this to the entire squad.
Swearyou guys didn' t know.
Big Red didn' t exactly[ br] let any of us help with[ br] the routines, Torrance.
[br]
It' s depraved.
I mean, those East Compton girls[ br] wanted to grill our asses.
We werejust flying ignorami, [br] forsobbing out loud.
[Whitney]
[br]
Seriously.
Let' s not put[ br] the "duh" in "dumb."
How are East Compton[ br] gonna prove anything?
You people are unbelievable.
I mean, we' re talking about[ br] cheating here.
Sorry, new girl, [br] but nobody hit your buzzer.
Look, lhate to bepredictable, [br] but Idon' t give a shit.
We logged the man- hours.
Don' t punish the squad[ br] for Big Red' s mistake.
[br]
Everyone in favor ofwinning?
Missy, but there' s no time.
lfwe don' t do the routine, [br] we' ve got nothing else.
Whatever.
Get out of here!
Hey, this is[ br] the living room.
It' s public domain.
[br]
Hey, may I please speak[ br] to Aaron?
He' s not here.
Ohh!
I' il take "Famous Losers" [br] for 200, Alex.
[br]
It' s not my fault you' re in love[ br] with a big gay cheerleader who[ br] won' t return your phone calls.
[br]
- Oh, so someonejust made him[ br] become a cheerleader?
He' sjust... busy!
Yeah, busy[ br] scamming on guys.
Bitch!
[Horn Honks]
Where is she?
[Horn Honking]
[br]
Come on.
No way.
Whoo!
Take it off!
Go, sexy.
Whoo!
You' re on fire, yeah!
- You sure I can stay over[ br] your house tonight?
[br]
Man, it' sjust wrong.
Cheering for them[ br] isjust plain mean.
Everybody comes[ br] to see you ladies, [br] anyway.
Because we' re[ br] such fi ne athletes.
Oh, live with it.
You' il be fi ghting off[ br] major oglers while we[ br] defend our sexuality.
What is your sexuality?
Jan' s straight, [br] while I' m... [br] controversial.
Are you trying to tell me[ br] you speak fag?
[br]
And Courtney and Whitney... [br] "dyke- adelic"?
No!
Are you kidding?
I don' t think so.
Courtney doesn' t[ br] wear anything[ br] under her spankies.
That' s[ br] no excuse, Jan.
Nuh- uh.
[br]
Where?
Don' t make him say it.
Oh, my God.
My God too.
You' re[ br] a sick man, Jan.
Now, ladies andgentlemen, put your hands together[ br] for the Rancho Carne Toros!
[Yelling]
Andnowlet' s hearit... for the five- time national[ br] cheerleading champions, the mighty Toros!

You want more?
[br]

You' re gonna[ br] pump our gas someday
That' s okay
You' re gonna pump[ br] our gas someday
- Come on, guys!

Knock 'em down, [br] roll' em around.
Come on, Defense, work!
Jan!
Go, Toros!
Come on, Toros!
You' re, like, [br] totally his eye candy.
God, I can' t believe[ br] you' d do that to Aaron.
Do what?
Especially with him.
What are you[ br] talking about?
[br]
We' re better at it than you.
You' re having[ br] cheer sex with him.
Let' sgo, Toros!
[Clapping]
Allright!
We' re sweet[ br]
We got the whip[ br]
We' re the best[ br]
We got the class to rock[ br] this school, ah, yeah
We can' t be had
So score them points
We' il rock thisjoint
Go, Toros, go, Toros[ br]
Go, Clovers, go, Clovers[ br]
Our game is fierce[ br] and we are hip
So get that weakness[ br] outta here
Tried to steal our bit[ br] but you look like shit
But we' re the ones[ br] who are down with it
[CrowdMurmuring]
[br]
- Istillsay we use[ br] the routine we have.
- Lfwe have to[ br] start over, I quit.
- [Horn Blows]
[br]
Finalscore:
Torosnothing.
[br]
Dude, you just lost.
So is every game[ br] that eventful?
No, thank God.
We have a real situation[ br] on our hands.
We might have[ br] to have a rumble.
[br]
Oh, so is your breath.
Yeah.
- What are you doing?
Where' s the bathroom?
- Right there.
Good night.
Are you into my brother?
[br]
I have a boyfriend.
[br]
[br]
Where have you been?
I' ve been, like, [br] totally busy with school[ br] and practice and stuff.
[br]
Miss Red snaked[ br] our routines from[ br] the East Compton Clovers.
[br]
They showed up at the game.
Gauntlets were thrown.
Tell me you didn' t know[ br] about this.
I don' t know[ br] what to do here.
This is not that big a deal.
[br]
Everybody uses[ br] everybody else' s material.
[br]
- That doesn 't help me.
We can' t do theirroutine[ br] at regionals because they' re[ br] gonna do theirroutine.
That' s all.
No problem.
Just hire a professional[ br] choreographer.
A choreographer?
Look, just think of it[ br] as collaboration.
The U. C. A. totally looks[ br] the other way.
[br]
His name is Sparky Polastri.
Remember nationals last year?
Knows his shit, all right?
Here' s the number.
It' s 555- 7219. [br]
Thanks, Aaron.
[br]
Bye, baby.
Who was that?
Mmm.
[br]
[br]
May I please speak[ br] to Sparky Polastri?
He' il need three or four days[ br] to teach us the routine.
It' s gonna cost us[ br] $2, 000.
What, do I have[ br] the letters A- T- M[ br] tattooed on my forehead?
We were thinking more[ br] like D- A- D- D- Y.
Maybe I can get 500.
1, 500 more by Monday.
[br]
Yeah, baby, yeah!
Work it, Kasey!
Soakit up.
- Workin 'hardforourmoney?
Give a little buffjob.
That' sgood.
Lookin 'good.
[Rock]
Missy, what the hell[ br] areyou doing?
[br]
[br]
Hand overyour 15 bucks[ br] or get out of here.
[br]
- Making money from guys[ br] ogling my goodies.
[br]
Hey, Torrance.
Come here a sec.
We' il just[ br] get this over with.
You know, [br] lbeggedmy mom[ br] fora brother.
He' d look a little ridiculous[ br] in that bikini, wouldn' t he?
[br]
Yeah.
[br]
[br]
- Don' t even worry about it.
Where the hell[ br] is this guy?
Listen, we' re lucky[ br] he' s even doing this for us.
[br]
[br]
Don' t speak.
You have weak ankles.
One ofyour calves[ br] is bigger than the other.
Too much makeup.
[br]
What' s with the skin?
"Sunlight"!
Male cheerleaders.
Enough said.
Smile.
- Don' t smile.
- Chicken.
Good general tone[ br] and musculature.
Report those compliments[ br] to your ass before[ br] it gets so big... it forms its own web site.
And you, I take you[ br] to be the captain, which means[ br] you' il probably need[ br] more work than anyone.
Look, you don' t... [br]
But... [br]
Don' t speak.
Don' t think.
Listen and learn.
I' m a choreographer.
That' s what I do.
You... are cheerleaders.
Cheerleaders are dancers[ br] who have gone retarded.
Whatyou do is a tiny, [br] pathetic subset ofdancing.
I will attempt to transform[ br] your robotic routines into poetry... written with the human body.
Follow me or perish, [br] sweater monkeys.
Got it?
Now cut that in half.
This is called a diet.
Everyone start one today.
Darcy, honey, [br] you should stop eating.
You see, when you[ br] skip a meal, your body[ br] feeds off its fat stores.
And ifyou skip enough, [br] maybe your body[ br] will eat your ass.
Why does everyone[ br] have togo on a diet?
- Come on, come on.
Let' sget back to work!
- [Towel Snaps]
I want dangerous!
Give mespirit fingers!
Spirit fi ngers.
Ouch!
What?
I' d catch you.
Think about it.
Okay, now, [br] spirit fi ngers.
Andspirit fingers!
- These are not[ br] spirit fi ngers.
And these... are gold.
One, two, three, four, [br] five, six, seven, eight.
[br]
Come on!
The spirit fi ngers are great!
Yeah, whatever.
- Hey.
What' s the matter?
Ah.
Cheer crisis.
I' vejust gotten[ br] so bogged down[ br] in all this... crap.
Well, if it' s crap, [br] why do you do it?
I don' t know.
So quit.
[br]
Yeah, I mean, ifyou[ br] don' t like it anymore.
I didn' t say that.
Sounds like it.
I don' t know what I want.
Irememberback[ br] when Icheeredat[ br] myschoolin Detroit.
You cheered[ br] at your other high school?
No, I never cheered, [br] but I know what[ br] you' re going through.
And regardless[ br] ofall the politics[ br] and the doubts... and the crap, you just have to know[ br] that you can do it.
And if it helps,
I know you can.
You do?
[br]
State regionals, [br] here we come.
Welcome to the world[ br] ofcompetitive[ br] cheerleading.
High school divisions, [br] please check the signs.
[br] lfyou' re not here...
Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy will be done...
Broncos!
Okay!
[br]
Cutter, I' m gonna[ br] kickyour ass, [br] you evil whore!
Oww!
[br]
She' s a little kid.
Get off me!
[br]
Stop it, Courtney!
Hi.
You, yes.
Your head was down.
Your head was down[ br] during that move.
How are you gonna[ br] give a proper score... ifyour head is down[ br] during a move?
Remember, they give[ br] extra points for alacrity[ br] and effulgence.
Did we bring those?
Look who' s here.
Hi.
We' re in trouble.
- [Hip- Hop]
[Cheering]
Leading the squad this year[ br] is senior Torrance Shipman.
Torrance, one ofthe things[ br] we' ve come to expect... from the Toros over[ br] the last fewyears is[ br] a highly originalroutine.
[br]
I think everyone[ br] goes out there[ br] the same way, being as prepared[ br] as they can be and[ br] just hoping for the best.
Prepare fortotaldomination!
[br]
Thankyou, [br]
Rancho Carne Toros, [br] and good luck.
Andnow, [br] the Mighty Muskrats... [br]
Thanks. ofMesa Cucamonga!
[br]
- They stole our routine!
Trojan spirit up!
It' s the curse.
There' s no curse, [br] and you' re not[ br] going to Hades.
[br]
We are in Hades!
[br]
Andnow[ br], from San Diego, California the five- time[ br] nationalchampions, the Rancho Carne Toros!
[br]
[br]
Didn' t wejust[ br] see this routine?
[Gasping]
Clattering]
The Rancho Carne Toros, [br] ladies andgentlemen.
Go, Toros!
That was, um, [br] interesting.
[br]
Y' all should' vejust stuck[ br] with our routines.
[br]
[br]
Next up, the Fighting Beavers[ br] ofSan Bernardino.
TorranceShipman?
Tad Freeman, Universal Cheer[ br]
We have a problem.
A problem?
[br]
Hey. the incredible sense ofdeja vu[ br] lexperiencedasl was watching[ br] that last routine.
I wouldn' tjust now.
What?
Official cheer business.
[br]
Hey, Torrance!
That was smooth.
Real smooth.
I' il see her later.
[br]
All righty.
Yeah.
Well, here' s another.
Thanks.
Does the name[ br]
Sparky Polastri[ br] mean anything to you?
Sparky Polastri?
Apparently he' s been peddling[ br] this same routine up and down[ br] the California coast.
Six squads total.
We' re holding[ br] an emergency session[ br] ofthe discretionary panel.
About what?
We' ve never had a situation[ br] like this before.
We really should[ br] disqualify you and... [br]
No, don' t punish the squad.
It was my choice[ br] to hire Sparky, not theirs.
Don' t penalize everyone[ br] for my bad judgment.
But since there' s[ br] no precedent for this, there' s nothing[ br] in the rule books[ br] that forbids it.
It' s simply frowned upon, and I suppose[ br] we can' t disqualify you[ br] on those grounds alone.
As defending champions, [br] you are guaranteed[ br] a bid to Florida, but know that we' il[ br] be watching you.
[br]
It' s not totally herfault.
[br] lhookedup...
This season should have[ br] been gravy, okay?
I delivered[ br] an idiot- proof routine.
- Platter, nationals, hello!
Oh.
Don' t be[ br] so naive, Torrance.
Look, the truth is[ br]
I was a real leader, okay?
I did what I had to do[ br] to win at nationals, and ever since I handed[ br] the reins over to you, you' ve run[ br] my squad into the ground!
If I made any mistake[ br] as a squad leader, [br] it wasn' t borrowing cheers.
Uh- uh.
Not cool.
Hey, Tor.
Tor.
Wait, [br] wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hey, Big Red' s a bitch.
[br]
Even she knows that.
I don' t know[ br] what to do here, Aaron.
I know I haven' t[ br] always been there foryou[ br] since I went to college.
It' s been[ br] a rough transition, [br] for both of us.
[br]
You do?
[br]
Which is why I hate[ br] to see you like this, [br] all stressed out.
You' re a great cheerleader, [br]
Tor, and you' re cute as hell.
It' sjust that maybe... [br]
[Sighs]
Maybe you should consider[ br] letting Courtney and Whitney[ br] take over the squad.
They' rejust like Big Red.
You want me[ br] to give up captain?
Hey, let them deal[ br] with the politics.
[br]
You cheer.
Cheer, Tor.
Mmm.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Friend ofyours?
He' s my boyfriend.
Look, Cliff, [br]
No.
It' s cool.
I made you a tape too.
Cliff...
Hey, Torrance, uh, [br] it' s me, Cliff.
Um, here' s, uh...
I wrotesomething, uh, [br] foryou, so here it is.
[Clears Throat]
Oh, Torrance
Can' t stand[ br] yourcheerleading squad
But Ilove[ br] yourpom- poms
[HardRock]
The truth
Andyou' rejust[ br] what Ineed
I' dbringyou flowers[ br] everyday
Just to rollyou[ br] in the hay
Iknowl' ilget my way
Andyou' rejust[ br] what Ineed
Not everything[ br] works asit seems
Andyou' rejust[ br] what Ineed
[br]
He told us[ br] you' re turning[ br] the squad over to us.
[br]
Gee, thanks.
[br]
Everyone.
Torrance is not[ br] to be harmed.
We' ve already decided[ br] on a course ofaction.
We' re gonna forego[ br] nationals this year.
[br]
- [Whitney]
Everyone' s[ br] already agreedto it.
[br]
And me!
[br]
- [Torrance]
[br] lcan' t believeyouguys.
The onlyperson who can[ br] officially resign thepost[ br] ofcaptain is the captain, and I' m not[ br] going anywhere.
[br]
Which we will!
Enough!
Now we fi nally have a chance[ br] to truly be original, [br] and you' re all running scared.
[br]
She' s crazy.
[br] lam not crazy, and I' m not resigning[ br] as captain either.
- You' re gonna have[ br] to kill me fi rst.
- That can be arranged.
Shut it, Whitney!
Let her talk!
Look, lknowl' ve screwedup[ br] royally as captain, but lbelieve in this squad, [br] andlknow we can[ br] bounce backfrom this.
I' m not saying[ br] it' s gonna be easy.
It' s gonna be hard work.
We need a new routine, [br] something amazing and fresh, and we' ve got less than[ br] three weeks till nationals, but ifwe can do it, [br] ifwe can pull this off, then we can really[ br] call ourselves original.
Now who' s with me?
All right!
[br]
Yeah!
Yeah!
[br]
Okay.
[br]
We' re gonna devote[ br] every waking hourtopractice... before school, [br] in between classes[ br] andafterschool.
Afternoonpractices[ br] willhave to be twice aslong.
Yeah.
[br]
Oh, yeah.
Fag!
Andsince[ br] the football team sucks[ br] no matterhowhard we cheer, we' il use nightgames[ br] topractice too.
But that' s not all.
We' re gonna study[ br] othertypes ofmovement, [br] from swing dance... to interpretive dance, [br]... you grow and you[ br] grow and you bloom! even mime.
We' ildrawinspiration[ br] from martialarts, [br]
Hah! musicals, everything.
Youguys know[ br] we' ve got the talent.
[br]
Clattering]
Tor!
What are you doing here?
Just wanted to[ br] come by and see you.
Is this a bad time?
[br]
I guess that' s it.
Oh.
No, no, but wait.
You weren' t too busy[ br] to sell me out to Courtney[ br] and Whitney, were you?
Gee, now I' m confused.
Well, I hope you' re not[ br] too busy to hear this.
[br]
It' s over!
[br]
- [Gasps]
You' re a great[ br] cheerleader, Aaron.
Bye- bye.
You' re a cheerleader?
U. C. A. just posted the nationals[ br] list on the Internet.
East Compton isn' t on it.
They couldn 't raise[ br] the money in time.
- They' re not going.
"They' re not going"?
Torrance, [br] that' sgoodnews.
They cannot not go.
That' s not good news.
[br]
I defi ne best as competing[ br] against the best there is[ br] out there and beating them.
- [Sighs]
It' s so unfair.
The fi rst[ br] inner- city squad to get a bid, [br] and they can' t afford to go?
[br]
Justin!
[br]
I just can' t.
Mr. Level- Playing- Field.
Yeah?
I' il make the call, but they' il probably[ br] say no.
[br]
Think of how much[ br] it' il mean to East Compton.
Do the right thing, Dad!
Did that[ br] just happen?
Yeah.
"Where we come from, [br] 'cheer' is not a word[ br] we hear very often."
"They should call us[ br] 'inspiration leaders' [br] instead."
Oh, that' s deep.
I like that.
It' s like we beggin '[br] for charity.
It' s not charity.
Pauletta Patton' s[ br] from our neighborhood.
- She' il understand[ br] why we need the money.
- Tell her we need to buy donuts.
[br]
- Stop being[ br] counterproductive, all right?
- Lava, please... stop teaching her[ br] these big words[ br] before she choke on one.
No, better I choke you, Lafred.
- Look, Jenelope... [br]
- You guys, stop!
Damn!
Well, tell her about[ br] the late- night practices[ br] we been having.
[br]
Now we' re talkin '.
You guys have to go[ br] to nationals.
- Did you come up here[ br] just to tell me that?
[br]
- Here.
What is this, hush money?
No.
[br]
You pay our way in[ br] and you sleep better[ br] at night... knowing how your whole world[ br] is based on one[ br] big, old fat lie.
Well, you know what?
- We don' t need you.
Why do you have to be so mean?
I' m just trying to do[ br] the right thing here.
[br]
That' s what a captain does.
Well, I' m a captain too, [br] you know, and I' m trying[ br] to make it right.
You wanna[ br] make it right?
Then when you go to nationals, [br] bring it.
Don' t slack off because[ br] you feel sorry for us.
- I never do.
Yeah, your parents[ br] just have to sign it.
I didn' t do[ br] anything!
[br]
I loved it.
Great.
Can I talk to you?
[br]
Aaron gave me a ride home.
[br]
I' m sorry.
And I wanted you[ br] to know that... [br]
I broke up with him.
Congratulations.
He didn' t[ br] believe in me.
You did!
Whatever.
[br]
You believed in me!
Hanging out with the airheads[ br] has really sharpened[ br] your verbal skills, huh?
- Screw you.
- Said the cheerleader.
I am a cheerleader, [br] and you' re a dumb ass.
Torrance likes you.
She likes you.
She has an odd way[ br] ofshowing it.
Don' t be stupid.
Yeah.
Do us all a favor[ br] and get overyourself[ br] and tell her how you feel.
I thought I had.
Well, try again.
[br]
[Announcer]
[br]
Nowback to Pauletta!
[br]
Thankyou.
Today on Pauletta[ br] it' s "Wish Day"!
[br]
Today' s lettercomes[ br] from East Compton, California.
[br]
"but that' s what we are, [br] the cheerleaders[ br] of East Compton High School.
"They should really call us[ br] inspiration leaders, [br] because that' s what we do.

- Where' s everyone going?
- Probably to a fair.
Or on a pilgrimage.
We' ve been gone a while, Majesty, so it' s hard to tell.
A while??!
Seven years in battle... and all for nothing.
- Where are you going?
- Straight on out of here.
Wasn' t that King Dobromil the Good?
Him?
Just some vagrant knight.
But if it was, to the devil with him!
Music
And we' re home.

- The king' s here!
What' il we do?
Oh, the devil!
- Welcome, Your Majesty!
- What' s going on? -
Everything' s running like clockwork.
Seems like everything' s running away that has legs.
- We missed you, you old crab.
- I bet you did.
And where' s Annie to greet me?
Where is my daughter? -
Gadding about, Majesty.
She hops on her horse and whoosh!
- She hops on her horse and what? -
- And whoosh!
You let that child go off on her own?
What Child, Majesty?
She' s ready for marriage.
Hear that?
My daughter' s grown up.
At least something went right.
Apollonia, are things really as bad as all that?
This kingdom was never in such a fix before.
- Can' t we do anything about it?
- Leave, like everyone else.
- Are you serious?
- Don' t worry, I' m staying.
And besides I had a vision...
- Something came to me in a dream.
- Again?
I fried up these unusual mushrooms with onions, and after I ate them I felt dizzy.
- And slept sound as a log.
- Well, what did you dream?
Our land... saved by a young man.
I don' t know why, but he' il be very ticklish.
And he' il call you Daisy.
Me?
Why me? -
How should I know?
What does he look like? -
I didn' t see his face but he' s a good soul.
He' s brave, honest, honorable... and an ass.
- I might have guessed.
- No, he' s not an ass.
I saw an ass.
Our rescuer will ride a donkey.
Maybe.
Or maybe not.
Maybe you just ate some crazy mushrooms.
That brute is killing that horse.
A foul land breeds foul people.
What can you do?
- I' m going over there.
- Hey, wait!
Stay here.
Oh, alright...
I' il make a good man of him.
Get lost, you loser!
That' s all we need, dammit!
Just sitting there like a dolt?
Help me!
Stop this insanity!
It' s your fault.
You drove that horse like a madman.
The sooner we' re gone the better.
What now, you freeloaders!
You' re the devil' s own!
- The chickens!
- The chickens!
So catch them, you good- for- nothings!
To hell with...!
Pull!
Pull!
Pull!
What are you gawking at?
Look at yourselves, you pigs!
We caught the hens like you said.
Butt out!
Or would you like a whipping too?
- I' il teach you to get so dirty!
- Don' t you feel stupid?
Venting your rage at women and children? -
It' s the good fairy.
- I' m no fairy, you dolt.
- Get lost!
- Or you' il get a taste too.
- Run, kids!
There you are, you beasts.
Get over here, you brats!
I' il teach you to hide from me!
No, daddy!
I' il catch the chickens.
I' m going to ring your necks anyway!
- I' il teach you to obey me!
- Hey!
- What? -
- You dropped your hat...
What a monster I am.
Run and play.
My darlings!
Give me a hug.
We live in the grip of an inexorable law which dictates that money circulates, gyrates, rotates, and circulates again.
Just like the blue blood in Your Majesty' s veins.
- And then suddenly...
- Wham bam, the current clogs.
Put a sock in it, you!
I reacted like a statesman.
- I let half the staff go.
- All the best people.
Shut up!
They cost the most.
Then I dismissed the troops.
- Impossible!
My loyal men? -
- But we' re at peace, Majesty.
But my greatest stroke was in the kitchen:
I fired everyone.
- Why should we cook so much? -
- He wants us to starve.
Shut your trap!
Waste not, want not, Majesty.
- So how much have we saved? -
- How... how... how much? -
How much? - From out of nowhere this melody popped in my head.
Listen...
Our King Dobromil...
Stop gawking!
Dobromil # 8, umpah tralala, wakes up feeling great!
- Umpah tralala...
- To the treasury, you tralala!
- This is our treasury? -
- Yes, it is.
Let' s have a look...
Corn!
- Where are the ducats?
- Ducats?
I gave the last one to a Gypsy fortuneteller.
And when she looked at my palm she cried out, "The devil' s eye!"
Isn' t that exciting? -
What were you doing the whole time?
We were expecting... the spoils of your wars.
Oh, shut up!
- What do you propose? -
- We' ve got one hope.
You need ducats!
And it takes ducats to make ducats.
The question is how to get them? -
Only by striking some advantageous bargain.
The only business around here is with hell.
Everyone else is broke.
I' m afraid, Majesty, that this time I agree with the jester.
You mean to say you think I should do business with hell? -
What other option do we have?
What business do you have in mind?
We could sell... hell... souls, Your Majesty.
Whose souls were you imagining?
Whose?
Majesty, I...
I' m prepared to sacrifice myself.
You know very well no one wants your soul.
Can you tell me why your wife' s feeding geese here?
She' s got this bizarre idea she' il make swans of them.
She herself is really a silly goose.
She' s mad as a hatter.
Majesty, things are looking up.
I' ve assigned tax collecting units.
Shut up already!
Aaagh!
Oh, man, you' il see!
What if we found Annie a rich husband?
Like I say:
The poor can' t and the rich won' t.
And woe is us!
Help!
- Help!
I' m drowning!
- Grab hold and quit screaming.
I save you and almost bite it.
I wanted to help you.
You looked like a corpse.
Where are we exactly?
In the land of King Dobromil.
- So you think that' s funny, eh? -
- No one' s laughing.
No?
Too bad!
Business goes better with a smile.
Well, Mr. Joker, tell me how much wood you brought.
Four cords.
Four? - That is a good joke!
- What do you expect for that?
- To wipe the slate clean.
- And what deeds have you done? -
- I burned the neighbors' barn.
So what?
That' s just fine.
- What??!
Sorry??!
Get lost!
Next!
- Ten cords of hard oak.
- That' s better.
- And what do you want for it?
- My mother- in- law in hell.
Kindly allow us to decide who we accommodate.
- All you get is... goat turds!
- I won' t let you cheat me!
Oh, yes, you will.
You took a business risk...
Want your house burned down?
Who' s got anything else to sell? -
I have some black pine.
- And where' s it from?
- King Lumír' s land.
Well, well...
So there' s something still growing there? -
I see you' re working hard here, too.
We' re doing our best.
So where' s the wood?
- That raft there.
- Two measly cords.
You get... a jackal' s paw.
That' s worth a fortune in hell.
Thanks.
It' s just what I wanted.
I' ve got something else for you.
What' s that? -
A toothpick of black pine.
A toothpick? -
What' s it good for?
For picking out food stuck in your teeth.
Yesterday we roasted a ram and I got something...
I can' t get it out.
The devil take it!
How much? -
30 ducats: too rich for your blood.
Are you joking?
Azarakh has whatever he wants.
The little bugger' s out!
- What do I do with it now? -
You can pitch it.
Well, that wasn' t such a good deal.
You' re a pretty good con man.
Maybe you' d like to work for us.
Gladly.
Get up!
I said get up!
Do you hear me?
You mangy ass!
I' m gonna break your stinking legs!
Get up!
Move or I' il...
This is driving me crazy.
I' il skin you alive.
And the devils will make drums of your hide.
You' il drum in hell...
I brought you some helpers.
Got any work for them? -
Yeah, plenty;, but so what? -
I' ve got nothing to eat.
I' il pay you twice as much.
- Alright.
Okay...
Just stop it.
Well, I guess there' s nothing.
Maybe next time.
I was thinking more of something in hell.
Don' t be so eager, my boy.
- All in good time.
- All in good time.
Everyone' s time will come.
Where' s he going? -
That leads nowhere.
Why' d you refuse the extra pay? -
He' d only give me Lucifer' s stinky old boots.
- Licking one clean was plenty!
- Why do you do it then?
I' ve gotta do something.
And at least I' ve got security.
- I hunt some, feed the family...
- What' s with the knife? -
I' m gonna skin this beast.
He refuses to work.
Let him live.
I' il buy him.
Ducats!
Ducats!
- I' m rich!
- I don' t think so.
You' re the same bootlicker you were before.
Come on, donkey, you' re coming with us.
- Man, we were rolling in clover!
- Let' s just go.
When it' s gone it' s simply gone, All we have soon passes.
When it' s gone it' s simply gone, No sense feeling blue.
Okay, here you are.
Headcheese...
Good Lord!
Save yourself if you can.
When it' s gone it' s simply gone, Whatever comes will come.
Off they go, now they' re gone, And I' m feeling free.
What' s here is here, What' s not is not,
Water flows on its way And rocks are all we' ve got.
Halt!
The king' s proclaimed a new tax!
Three ducats per adult and one per child.
- Let' s get on with it!
Pay up!
Pay up!
- I won' t!
- Oh yes, you will!
Beat him!
- What?
Beat him!
Take that!
You won' t pay, eh? -
Apollonia, thanks for the herbs; here' s your oil and cloth.
Okay, you fiddling hack...
Two adult and two kids.
8 ducats.
- I' m happy to pay.
But why only four? -
What about my pup? -
Doesn' t he have a soul? -
He' s one of God' s creatures.
- Sure is.
- I' il pay for him too.
- Great.
- Are you mad? - All our money?
- All of it? - No way!
We' ve still got our nest egg.
Come on out, ducats!
I bet it was stuffy in there.
Ten ducats...
A few extra so the king can live it up a bit.
- I' il see that he gets them.
- That fine man deserves them.
Deserves them?!
Are you nuts?
We sold everything.
Are you trying to make beggars of us?
I' il get you, you witch!
- Me?
- Make fools of honest people!
What did you do to him, you witch?!
- No!
- You witch!
- You put weeds under his hat.
- What' s going on, crazy woman?
- Put me down!
- You know I will, you wretch.
- Good day, Madam Daisy.
- Wait...
Are you talking to me, an old woman? -
You' re the prettiest garden I' ve ever met.
Good gracious, my vision!
That' s him.
And he' s got an ass.
Annie, he' s here!
He' s here!
He' s come!
Who?
Our rescuer!
The one from my dream.
And you know what he called me?
Daisy!
Wasn' t he supposed to call me that?
Well...
Prophesy is never so clear- cut.
But he' s got a donkey.
I still have shoes!
My very best shoes.
- Didn' t we overdo it a bit?
- Perhaps a bit.
Certainly someone needs them more than me.
Get a grip on yourself!
Aren' t you ashamed?
Don' t spoil my fun, sniveler!
So you want to have fun, eh? -
Come and play!
How... how dare you??!
What are you waiting for?
Seize him!
That' il teach you.
Give it to him good!
Let him have it!
He' s had enough.
Am I in heaven? -
Sorry to disappoint you, but I' m not your guardian angel.
- Don' t move;, just lie still.
- Does something hurt?
My heart.
I think I' m dying.
- That' s a lovely handkerchief.
- They kicked you in the head.
You' d better come and let Annie and I treat you.
Are you satisfied?
We' re flat broke!
What' s going on? - Why do you look so thunderstruck?
- Hey, kids, dad' s back!
- Daddy!
It seems that we, King Dobromil the Good, are aging rather fast.
Dogs age seven times faster and make not a peep of complaint.
What a flatterer you are.
Why should I flatter you when you don' t pay me?
Aren' t you exaggerating? -
It' s so good to be home, sire.
Don' t let him spoil it.
It was a garden here when we left.
And now?
Don' t you smell the stench? -
If you don' t like it here pack your things and go.
Don' t say that a second time...
What would I pack anyway?
There' s not even a pot to pee in around here.
Give me a ducat and I' il be off.
Got one? -
Here.
This king had what it takes.
It' s not a real ducat anyway.
Oh well...
Have a nice time, Majesty.
Farewell.
If you' re Annie, you' re the only thing here worth envying.
Annie, is it you?
Incredible!
You really are old enough to marry.
But you deserve a spanking for gallivanting around so.
- Where' s the jester going?
- Nowhere...
He just came back to see his daughter.
Who' d have thought... that the people still had so much money? -
But we needn' t tell the king.
Get a move on!
- Heave!
- I am.
You little ducats don' t want to, but you have to.
Jump!
How much longer must we slave?
Oh, please!
I' ve got to bleed the people dry.
But relax...
We' il be repaid a thousandfold.
Next batch...
- Sure.
Come on, ducats.
- Come on.
- I' m coming.
Think the king suspects us?
Stop creating devils out of nothing.
He' s harmless as a lamb.
He' s eating out of my hand.
- Toss them in.
- The gate' s closing; in you go!
- No, no, no!
Did you say goosey? -
- How about roasting one?
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes.
The oven' s hot and I' m a bit peckish.
Get a move on!
Keep working!
Hold up!
Good work.
The minister will be satisfied.
- Looking good with that crown!
- What' s this?!
- What' s going on here?
- They' re rebelling.
Each sinner has to drink a stein of swill.
Hot swill.
- Drink up, boys.
- What??!
Drink it down.
Swill, eh?
It' s beer!
Dark beer.
And well chilled.
So our sinners can live it up.
I' il give you "live it up," you idiot!
To Lucifer, now!
So you felt sorry for the sinners? -
- Yeah.
- It' s hot, right? -
Nothing' s better than a cold one when it' s hot, eh? - Lovely!
I even have a hammock to rock them in.
And I sing them lullabies...
That' s a great idea.
And I have something for you too.
A sweet candy... for my sweet little dove.
Get this into your thick head: goodness is treacherous.
But evil is exciting, intoxicating, even elevating.
Take him away.
He' s the sixth this week.
What' s going on? -
It' s Apollonia' s flowers, what else?
No wonder they' re so messed up.
Apollonia, my dear, stick you tongue in your ear.
- Nice rhyme, eh? -
- Excellent execution!
- So stick it out.
- My tongue? -
Taste good? -
This isn' t funny anymore.
Why is Dobromil' s kingdom still afloat, eh?
I don' t understand it.
I want him here!
King Dobromil the Good...
We' ve got to speed things up a bit.
Excellent.
Goosey kissy...
What the matter? -
Don' t we like it? -
Greetings, friend.
Enchanté, madam.
- Why are you here, boss? -
- Sit, scoundrel.
Why insult him, sir? -
That' s his title.
I was in the neighborhood and thought I' d drop in on a friend to find out how the case stands.
- When can I bring the contract?
- The contract? -
The king' s still not ready.
He' s got to stew in his own poverty a bit longer.
- It' s dragging on too long.
- I' m doing what I can.
The king hinders my every move.
He wants to marry Annie off.
That' s not good.
That' s bad.
A rich husband might screw up our plans.
I should punish you.
Me?
What about the gold I' ve sent down to you? -
Watch...
A ducat.
I put it in the pitcher...
Take it out.
I can' t.
- You can.
- This is some of your magic.
Drop the coin and your hand is free.
You see? - You' ve got to make a sacrifice to save your skin.
Don' t worry about any suitors.
I' il think of something.
Hey, look who' s come for a visit!
I thought that beating made me hallucinate.
It' s you who' s Apollonia' s hallucination.
- You' ve made yourselves at home.
- Maybe I was waiting for you.
Such a great match, Philip and his wench...
Whoa, you beast!
See, you shouldn' t bully that animal; it' s sacred.
Must I do everything myself?
Show me you' re good for something.
You live somewhere nearby?
At the castle.
At the castle? -
So you serve at the castle.
It seems like I serve here at Apollonia' s.
Has anyone ever told you you were pretty? -
No...
Actually, yes.
The king' s jester.
Once he shouted out:
"Annie, you' re pretty... ugly."
You' re a real apothecary.
It comes in handy sometimes.
Careful, that' s nightshade.
It' s poisonous.
You used this to make that man crazy? -
I wanted to make him good, and I made him an idiot.
Here' s cherry tarts and berry juice.
Let me take that.
I like it here, but I need good work...
Work that' s well paid.
It won' t be easy to find work.
What are you good at? -
I know a lot about... just about everything.
We need someone like that.
- And you?
- Me?
I can fight a bit, but not much else.
Fighting isn' t bad, and you' ve got the donkey too.
I' d accept a position at the castle.
But I won' t be a servant.
Maybe the king himself will find you something.
Annie will put in a good word.
I don' t need any wench' s help.
- I' ve got to go.
- Wait; will we meet again? -
That' s up to you.
You know where to find me.
Don' t worry; we' il visit.
- What' s that? -
- Devils come for my flowers.
We paid 30 ducats for that ass.
For the rest I' il remember you in my prayers.
Philip!
If you stick these herbs under someone' s hat they become stupid but good.
They might come in handy.
Before someone gets our jobs.
Thanks for everything, Apollonia.
And we' re alone again.
Let' s go get some water.
Come, Mira, let' s water the garden.
What are you whining about? -
What?
What' s going on? -
Scoundrels!
Enough of your shenanigans; I need water!
Damnation, Apollonia, don' t make me angry.
Not enough for your stinking herbs? - Just say what you want.
- Want pearls? - You' ve got them.
- Pitch them to your swine!
- I don' t have that many.
- Beat it, you bat.
Impressive, eh? - I can even do a triple flip with a half twist.
I' m watering.
Insufferable flowers.
I' d scorch them with brimstone.
Cut the swagger, Mr. Wheeler Dealer.
I' m pure as a lily and you' re powerless here.
Look who' s swaggering now.
Even you' il end up as my guest.
Beat it!
Hey, look...
We need a cook, but not just anyone.
Show me what you can do.
I' m supposed to concoct a meal from slops?
Cut the jokes, friend.
You' re cooking for the king.
This is for the king?
It' s fit for pigs.
The minister will haze you if it doesn' t pass muster.
Come on then.
Don' t worry, we' il manage.
We' il add... a lot of garlic.
It' il turn out, you' il see.
Let' s light the oven.
Well...
What are you good for? -
Majesty, maybe I could be your advisor.
And what could you advise me about?
To be honest...
I' m good at everything... as far as I know.
Okay, then...
Tell me what you' d do if people were fleeing the realm.
Fleeing? -
I' d flee too...
To catch up with them... and bring them to their senses.
My kingdom for a horse!
Your Majesty, this is Philip.
He' s applying as head cook.
Oh, is he really? -
Let' s give it a try.
Don' t risk it, Majesty; it was made from our own stores.
This one is a dangerous criminal bent on poisoning you.
It smells wonderful!
Garlicky.
It' s excellent!
I name you head cook.
What about me, Majesty? -
You?
A good question...
I think you' il fit in perfectly here.
You' re my new jester.
Put it on.
You come with me.
It suits him, eh, daughter? -
- That' s your daughter? -
- Last I heard.
- Are you a devil? -
- You.
- No?
Too bad.
You have that hellish fire in your eyes.
I can feel it.
Well, boys, one of you will return among the living to sue for the princess' hand.
You know Princess Annie?
little goat tootsy.
Aha, my nephew Urugal...
You' d like to marry Annie, eh?
Annie' s footsy:
little goat tootsy.
But he... he... he wasn' t selected.
No?
Such a handsome buck? -
As you wish...
I repeat:
Annie' s going to marry one of you.
And that' s how we' il knock the king for a loop.
Who' il volunteer? -
What about you, Urugal? -
Not interested?
Do I go after Annie? -
- You understand perfectly.
- Sure I do.
Marry Annie and knock the king for a loop.
I choose you, Urugal.
And you...
Get lost!
- You' re a deep thinker.
- True.
- How will you get her? -
Iittle goat tootsies.
- Excellent.
- That' s right.
My father' s looking for a husband for me.
- I thought you already had one.
- Cut it out.
Let' s leave here.
You want to run away with me? -
You know nothing about me.
- I know everything.
Who am I then?
You' re my dream.
And Apollonia conjured you up.
She ate some mushrooms and you appeared to her.
- The donkey, too, right?
- Exactly.
Can I tickle you?
Sure.
- Feel anything?
- Nothing.
I feel it...
- It' s really nice.
- Oh, you!
It doesn' t tickle? -
You' re supposed to laugh.
I feel more like crying.
- You' il soon be married...
- So let' s run away.
That won' t help.
You don' t want to go with me.
You don' t really want me.
So beautiful... it hurts my eyes.
Then we must protect them.
Prince, you' re like manna from heaven!
I know.
Lucifer chose me himself.
I came for Annie.
Here I am!
Catch me, Annie!
Run, run!
Philip? -
I can hear you...
Are you here?
Annie!
- Here I am!
- Wait!
- Now it' s your turn.
- No... - Oh, yes it is.
Follow me!
Watch the steps!
- That' s cheating.
- Sometimes cheating is best.
Oh, really?
Hey, you' il pay for that!
I' d rather be enjoying a warm bath.
Present arms!
An honored guest has arrived:
Prince Laguru of the East!
- Let' s stoke this fire a bit, eh? -
- Prince, the king' s there.
I' il present this to him.
Hi there.
- A gift from the prince.
- Thank you.
- Coal?
- It' s not coal.
It' s lava.
- What do I do with it?
- I use it to scrub my heels.
This is your gift? -
You' ve got nothing else?
Diamonds...
Hey, bring that here.
- Got any more? -
- Coming out our ears.
Prince Laguru...
- What brings you here?
- It' s like this...
I... uh... want the princess... uh... as my wife...
And I' m gonna knock Your Majesty for a loop.
Majesty... the prince is from a land near Mongolia.
It' s their custom that... that... that the groom must fight the father for his bride.
As they say, he has to knock him for a loop.
If we must fight...
- I' m sure it isn' t necessary.
- I don' t care, but where' s the... pr... pr... princess? -
Hi there!
Your Majesty, apparently she' s dressing.
She wants to look her best.
What do you want? -
Annie' s fooling around with the cook in the bath.
Annie was seen in your steam bath with the cook.
What??!
Just look at us.
Hold on...
Wring it out.
Anne!
What are you doing?!
Is that Annie footsy goaty tootsy?
That drowned rat? -
That' s how you greet your future husband? -
Must she greet this Lagoon, or whatever his name is?
Majesty, he' s a prince.
Prince or no, take these and get out!
What am I, like, supposed to do now? -
Start looking elsewhere.
I don' t ever want to see you with that cook again.
- That' s youth, eh?
- You' il catch cold, Princess.
Hey, I had this for Annie.
What do I do with it now? -
- For Annie, eh? - Give it here.
- That' s not for you!
Get over here.
Give me a kiss.
I don' t want a kiss and I don' t want you!
Of course you do.
Get back here!
Can I come in?
Or so it seems.
Watch your mouth!
You know I want what' s best for you.
- So you locked me up? -
- It' s for your own good.
I' m ashamed of you.
To let your realm be plundered like this.
No one respects you anymore.
- But I wasn' t even here.
- Exactly.
Can hear us, King? -
We' re packing up; and if you' re wise you' il do the same.
- Someone' s ruining this place.
- Beat it!
- Get lost, scum!
You say no one respects me anymore.
Maybe someone still does.
We are, after all, of royal blood.
I think it' s time I met a certain someone...
What a waste.
What have you got there? -
Nothing, Majesty.
Why are you lying? -
The devil knows why.
Tell Lucifer to come.
It' s time I met him.
You know the Spanish boot?
A cruel instrument.
Nails pierce the foot...
Hell fire!
This little thing is far more humane.
The so- called Spanish thimble.
We gently and carefully place the thumb inside...
And voila!
It becomes an inkwell full of royal blood.
Majesty, the time is now ripe.
Give me your soul and I' il shower your realm... with riches.
Your signature, please.
We' il wait for midnight to strike.
I have a weakness for theatricality.
The clock has struck.
Please be so kind, Majesty, as to endorse this parchment, this document of documents, with your royal signature in blood.
Life is beautiful, so enjoy it.
I' m coming for you in a year.
Guido!
I' ve got to get out of here.
Give this to Annie.
It' s important.
And tell her I love her, and that she should wait for me.
- Thanks.
Lucifer, wait!
- What do you want? -
- To work for you.
Hurry up.
You wanted a job so no goofing off.
Show me what you rustled up.
What matters most is how it tastes.
The sauce is great.
What' s in it? -
I can' t even remember...
Cranberries and hot peppers.
Oh ho!
Sweet and hot, like the carrot and the stick!
I use that too when necessary.
Okay, you' ve sold me.
For a year then?
It needn' t be in your own blood yet.
Put it there.
What happened to them? -
They sold me their souls.
Lifeless bodies lost in oblivion.
And that' s the greatest punishment, eh... for you of noble birth?
Your father, isn' t it? -
You are Philip, son of King Lumír, are you not?
I know all about you.
You too will end like this one day.
- I' il get you.
- And what if I get you? -
Think you can dupe me?
Laughable, but interesting.
I' d happily play for your soul.
If you 'get me,' as you say, I' il return your father' s soul.
Of course, if you fail during the year of your service, you' il keep me company for all eternity.
- Not a bad offer, eh? -
- Not bad.
Don' t worry, we' il grow on each other.
Now, down to business...
Forgive me, Philip, for hurting you.
I never wanted to hurt anybody!
The times are so strange.
Just tell me what to do and I' il do it.
Thanks, Apollonia!
It worked!
I can' t believe it worked.
Yes, you' ve got me, Philip.
Do you take me for a fool!
I' m not got so easily, my boy.
It' s just grass.
Guido exchanged it on you.
Now get lost!
And no more games!
Where' s the food?!
Finally.
Can' t you move any slower? -
Give it here.
It took forever.
What is this crap?
Where' s the cook?
I' il shove this slop down his throat!
Bring him to me.
We' ve sought him in vain.
He' s vanished into thin air.
Guido, where' s Philip? -
Where else? -
He found a job with better pay.
That' s a lie.
Don' t ask me then if you think I' m lying.
Didn' t he leave me a note?
Nothing.
He just disappeared.
Move.
Did you send him away?
No.
Why would I?
But maybe it' s for the best.
You' il never see me again.
What a morning, huh? -
Let' s cheer things up...
Can you explain this? -
Don' t recognize yourself, eh? -
You did it all for this? -
Guards, seize him!
So that' s how it is.
If I' m going to hell you' re coming with me.
What are you waiting for?
- Seize him!
- Against your own king? -
- That' s right...
- Out of the realm' s coffers.
- This can' t be happening!
Take the old man as well.
We' re cleaning up around here.
And find the princess so everything' s in order!
Guard them carefully!
Don' t let them step one foot out of the castle.
You!
Got anything to say about that coin? -
Throw him behind bars!
Come on, you clown!
What' s happening...?
Where are you going?
Did they hurt you?
Such brutes have no feelings.
He' s just a big oaf.
- I' il teach him his manners.
- He' s yours.
Get this: if Guido tells you to cut off my hand then you' il cut off my hand.
Oh, man, have I got an idea!
I' il give you the royal seal.
You' d like that, eh?
- I don' t really need it.
- Why not? -
I' ve got a present for you too.
- Do you like it? -
- A lot.
Now go visit the king because he must be lonely.
I' m going to see the king!
Guard them well.
All of them!
Philip!
Philip!
Excuse me, did you take anyone across last night?
My Philip? -
This is where you are.
Mira, find Annie.
Annie!
How could you do this to me? -
I' ve had a devil of a time.
Are you listening? -
What are you doing here?
I' m scared about Philip.
I' m sure something' s happened to him.
Otherwise he' d have already found me.
Can you believe it? -
First he says he loves me; then he leaves without a word.
Philip knows what he' s doing.
Love must sometimes stand aside.
Easy to say for someone who spent her whole life with herbs.
- What could you know of love?
- You think I know nothing?
Listen here.
I' ve been in love.
A love that burned even in the coldest winter.
But it wasn' t meant to be, and when he left me my love was still so strong that I drowned myself in tears.
Who was it? -
Your father.
My father? -
But he married my mother.
Sure, she was rich and noble so he married her.
Just like that!
A lovely spot, eh?
We also came here.
Love- in- winter grows here.
Come here...
Philip will return, you' il see.
- Finally.
What is it? -
- Jackal' s paw a la honey.
Looks great.
Get lost!
I forgot to tell you... my dear Philip, that everything here lives and dies by my hand.
So only I can destroy King Dobromil' s dear little contract.
Everything moves towards it' s end.
Except me of course.
- Forgive me, Father...
- Why do you want to destroy us?
That' s just like you.
Always blaming someone else.
You destroy yourselves.
I just watch with my fingers crossed.
But with your traits you play right into my hands.
It won' t be long now.
Hell fire!
Mira!
Apollonia will have to look for us again.
Come here, Mira.
Come on!
Hey, you little rascal.
Let' s pick the herbs and get home.
Still sulking? -
I' d like to make you... a proposition.
Marry me.
You and I... get married?
Have you lost your mind? -
The throne will soon be vacant.
It could be ours to share.
Since when do jesters barter the royal throne? -
It' s royal no longer.
- The king sold Lucifer his soul.
- How dare you say that!
You liar!
He' s got few days left to live.
Marry me or you' il never see your father again.
Everything here is mine anyway.
Not me.
It' s just a matter of time.
There' s still Philip.
Forget about him.
He' s Lucifer' s eager servant.
You lie.
- I' m flying!
- We' il be angels soon.
- I' m light as a feather.
- But you feel like a ton.
- You' re making me swing.
- You' re flying too.
- Something fell from above.
- Another angel I suppose.
- Who are you?
- Get your hands off me!
Don' t worry.
We love the world.
Yesterday we were rolling in Apollonia' s clover.
- Pure bliss!
- Now we' re angels... almost.
Wanna try it? -
- How do I find Lucifer?
- Lucifer? -
He can' t stand angels.
But if he' s who you want, keep heading straight on.
Urugal!
Help me, Uncle!
Ah, what delicate flower do we have here? -
She wants to speak to you, sir.
I see you' ve moved up in the world.
I' ve made the best of things.
What do you want? -
Do you know anything about Annie?
You mean the princess? -
What is she to me? -
It' s as if she vanished.
I' d like to speak to the king.
Why not? -
Apollonia!
- What are you doing here?
- I' m not here to reminisce...
I' m looking for Annie.
She was with me... then she disappeared.
I' m afraid for her.
My Annie is gone and only fear remains.
Dobromil, I don' t recognize you.
It' s a mess here, just like your whole kingdom.
Did you come to reproach me?
- I can do nothing more.
- Yes...
So I heard.
You wanted to marry Annie to a rich man.
You' d just ruin her life, like you ruined ours.
Your refined combinations send me into raptures.
Not for much longer: my year is almost up.
Almost up? - Let' s have a look...
You signed on for ten years.
What?
Lucifer, get up here!
- Seems like she wants something.
- I' m telling you to get up here!
Another bucket of diamonds...? -
I' il be back in a flash.
I' ve got a deal for you.
Well, spill it.
I' m all ears.
Cancel the contract with the king... and I' il give you my garden.
You can do whatever you want with it.
Too late.
I don' t care about your herbs anymore.
Soon enough not even thistles will grow here.
- Come, my lovely flower.
You wanted to see Lucifer, so come on!
Annie!
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same.
Oh, come now, kids.
What a pleasant surprise!
I trust I' m not interrupting.
Came to say hi? - I can' t praise Philip' s services too much.
But he just did something a little stupid.
You stole something out of my pocket.
To help King Dobromil? - No!
To save his own precious cowardly skin.
It wasn' t for 10 years!
It was just a scrap of parchment.
You walked into my trap.
You see? - Now I' ve got you.
Golly, boss, you' re brilliant.
Get her out of here.
It' s not her time yet.
Where' re your shoes?
I gave them to Guido for a unicorn.
- A unicorn?
- Yeah.
- Where is it?
It was in the sky this morning, then it vanished.
He won' t drive me crazy.
I have some news of Annie.
What...? - Annie?
What is it? -
You' il get no more clouds from me.
Tell me about Annie.
I heard she' s in danger.
Danger? -
What danger? - Speak!
I don' t know...
I said I just heard about it.
Find her.
I' il give you anything you want.
I already have everything.
But maybe there is something.
If I find her will you agree to our marriage? -
Bring her.
I want to see her again.
Majesty, the clock has struck midnight and I have come with my faithful servant.
The hour has struck... just as I struck the coins that now fill your treasury.
Don' t ruin this for me.
I like this part the best.
As I said, the hour has struck.
Here is the parchment signed in your blood.
Come with me, please.
Just a moment, Master.
I' d like him to fulfill his promise.
He must give me his daughter' s hand in marriage.
I had no choice, Annie.
I had to see you again.
All very touching, but I' ve got a document here, so let' s go.
Lucifer? -
Shouldn' t you read it first? -
You think so?
Well okay...
I...
Philip the cook, will faithfully serve Lucifer...
What is the meaning of this?
That' s that fake scrap of parchment, remember?
My year of faithful service.
Where' s the king' s... signed in blood? -
Destroyed it by your own hand.
Get it? - The king is free.
He' s not yours anymore!
He' s not yours anymore!
The princess is getting married!
And not to just anyone.
But to our savior Prince Philip!
Hey, you left without us!
Don' t worry.
I' il come back for you.
Strike!
Lift!
Strike!
No more!
Enough!
Or won' t you lick those boots? -
Always flitting about, eh, Annie? -
To our children' s happiness; how about it, Lumr? -
And to your health, Dobromil.
And to weathering that terrible storm.
I myself feel like a young man, full of energy.
He' s trying to amuse us!
It' s a barrel of laughs here.
I guess I' il gather my old knights for a noble conquest.
Why not stay here and put your realm in order?
- To our savior' s happiness.
- Hey there, my daisy Annie!
Hi!
Oh, that' s the end!
If you only snoop and never seek to find,
And still expect to strum in heaven' s dell,
If you always speak but nothing mean,
And still expect to strum in heaven' s dell,
Why the world makes you sigh,
They just say, The devil knows why.
If you hide goat tootsies beneath the floor,
And still expect to strum in heaven' s dell,
Why the world makes you sigh,
They just say, The devil knows why..
Subtitled by John Brent
THE DEVlL KNOWS WHY
Hey, can I get another drink down here?
I' ve been to prison once.
I' ve been married twice.
I was once drafted by Lyndon Johnson and had to live in shit- ass Mexico for two and a half years for no reason.
I' ve had my eye socket punched in, a kidney taken out, and I got a bone chip in my ankle that' s never gonna heal.
But nothing has ever sucked more ass than this.
I would have killed myself a long time ago.
Come to think of it, I still might.
Where I come from, we didn' t celebrate Christmas.
Not because we were Jewish, but because my dad was a worthless- coward fucking asshole whose idea of a present was a daily punch to the back of the head.
He did teach me how to crack a safe, though.
My dad never did shit with his life, so he took it out on me.
I' d have to say you were right.
But at this point, it' s too late to start over.
Funny how things work out.
It' s fucking hilarious.
What a darling photo.
Are you certain you only want the single?
Additional photos come in handy as gifts for Grandma and Grandpa or as a wonderful remembrance for friends.
You know what?
This one, I think it' s more than enough.
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.
So, what do you want, little girl?
A drum set.
Okay.
See you later.
I saw you at another mall.
Well, I' m very happy for you.
You' re not really Santa.
If you were Santa, you could do magic.
Here.
Let' s watch you disappear.
Santa' s got to pee.
- What do you want?
- A new bike.
That' s a new one.
Excellent.
Attention, shoppers.
The store will be closing in five minutes.
Thank you for shopping with us.
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that' s the last one.
Thank the fuck Christ.
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.
You pissed yourself.
Hey, happy holidays.
Merry Christmas.
Get home safe.
- We' re going out for a beer.
I' il get right back to you.
What the hell' s wrong with you?
I' m trying to fucking leave.
Pants are awful baggy.
You got anything in there?
My dick.
You want to see it?
Keep pushing me.
All the time.
Ready.
- How' s it going?
- I' m finished when I' m finished.
I need a melon baller and a loofah.
Got it.
Fuck the loofah.
Let' s go.
Marcus, you get the loofah?
Drive.
Oh, I' m dizzy.
Put me down.
Oh, come on.
Hey, baby, two more of these, all right?
That' s it for me.
You can' t drink worth a shit, you know that?
I weigh 92 pounds, you dick.
One more.
It' s a celebration.
You' re getting worse, you know that?
Well, at least I got it open.
It took you long enough.
I remember when you could unlock a lock like it was nothing.
Yeah, well, you don' t have to worry about me anymore.
I' m out.
Bullshit.
Bullshit, my ass.
We just made $111, 000 in one night.
Exactly.
I figure I got enough to go to Miami.
And do what?
Get a car.
A bar out on the beach.
Something like that.
Maybe marry a waitress.
What?
You ain' t gonna do shit except go down there and drink your fucking ass off.
You' re gonna piss everything away and end up counting the days till next Christmas.
You' d like that, wouldn' t you?
Well, it ain' t gonna happen.
If I call you next December... if I call you next December... you' re gonna be so happy to hear from me you' re gonna do a goddamn backflip.
You' re gonna put that Santa hat on so fast that you' re gonna get fucking hat- burn.
Can I get you guys two more?
We' re all right.
See?
I' m already on the wagon.
Asshole!
Get out from behind my bar!
Put the drink down right now!
- Fuck me, huh?
Asshole!
Get the fuck out of here right now!
Hey, Tiffany, you want to play "Hide the Nazi" one day?
God damn it.
Here you go, sweetie.
I got something for your pretty ass.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Wow. $5.
Thanks.
I gotta listen to my messages, and you need to take a shower.
I' m a dancer.
I sweat.
Yeah, well, you smell like a bum' s nut sac.
Fuck you.
Message one.
This is Andrew Kaplan again, from the collection agency.
Message two.
This is Dolores Axelrod.
You ran into my car last week.
I called State Farm, but they have no record of any insurance policy for you.
In case you misplaced it, my phone number is 4...
Message three.
Willie, it' s Marcus.
It' s that time of year again.
Pack your shit.
Phoenix.
Jesus Christ!
Can you maybe keep it together for just 10 minutes?
Harrison, just let me explain, please.
Financially...
Well, you get what you paid for, Chipeska.
Five Christmases I' ve been here.
You flip me for some stranger who' il do it for peanuts and who happens to work with a real midget.
Nobody comes here for the elf.
Santa' s the attraction.
I do Burl Ives songs.
Does this schmo even play guitar?
Look, Harrison, it' s not about the money or the midget.
Believe me, if it was, I...
I think you' re supposed to call them...
Oh, just forget it.
Hacks!
Hi.
Bob Chipeska.
Welcome.
Great photo and résumé, by the way.
Thanks.
We' d like to think we do a good job.
We' re fine.
Yes.
You know, the, um...
Performance, like sexual?
- Excuse me?
Are you saying there' s something wrong with my gear?
Is that what you' re saying?
- Willie.
My fuck stick.
Take a seat.
You know how your blood sugar is.
He' s not going to say "fuck stick" in front of the children?
It' s a joke.
An adult joke for us adults.
Just a joke.
"Fuck stick"?
I thought it was very strange, too.
I wanted you to be aware.
Because, you know, there is an adult world and a child' s world, and that' s okay.
I' m no censor.
"Little friend"?
Yes, he happens to be a dwarf.
Or midget.
But, uh, he' s a little guy.
Little Billy Barty.
God rest.
Not the fat sausage fingers.
That' s what they like.
Uh, right.
That' s it?
Yeah.
Merry Christmas!
Santa' s coming.
Have you seen that new Santa they just hired?
He' s back there drunk.
He' s coming, guys.
Santa will be here real soon.
God damn it!
What the fuck you doing?
You blow this, and we' re broke.
'Cause, pal of mine, you don' t know squat!
Now, put on your hat and get out there.
And try to act professional, for Christ' s sakes.
Next.
Oh, good.
What do you want?
What are you doing?
Nintendo Deer Hunter 3.
I don' t give a shit what you want.
Blowing snot all over everybody and fucking whatever.
Come on.
What do you want?
- Um, Santa?
- Yeah, I' m Santa.
What do you want?
- Um, Barbie.
- Say cheese.
Barbie.
Next.
What do you want?
Fraggle- Stick car.
What the fuck is that?
Fraggle- Stick car.
Well, I heard you.
Fraggle- Stick car.
Hey, check out this loser.
How you doing today?
Hey, loser.
Hey, dipshit.
Moron.
How you doing today?
Dumb- ass, why don' t you turn around?
Fuck this.
You' re next.
Next.
This is not the DMV, all right?
Move it along.
What' s your name?
You can tell me.
I know.
How about Santa?
If you don' t tell him, you won' t get a present.
Come on and tell Santa all about it.
What do you want?
Well, come on.
A snot- rag?
Another fucking Mongoloid.
Marcus, get this kid off me before he pisses on me.
Don' t fuck with my beard.
It' s not real.
No shit.
But, you see, I got sick and all the hair fell out.
How did you get sick?
I loved a woman who wasn' t clean.
Mrs. Santa?
It was her sister.
What' s it like at the North Pole?
Like the suburbs.
Which one?
Apache Junction.
What the fuck do you care?
Now, get off my lap.
You sit there like a fucking retard.
You are really Santa, right?
I' m an accountant.
I wear this fucking thing as a fashion statement, all right?
He' s freaking me out.
I got to get a drink on.
I' il see you tomorrow.
Just don' t come into work stinking of booze again.
Why don' t you get going?
You' il be late for your "Wizard of Oz" Candy Bar Guild.
Lollipop Guild, you asshole.
Two- year- olds flip me shit better than you.
You saying something to me?
I' m gonna stick my whole fist up your ass.
What?
Another Grand- Dad, Santa?
Got a name?
After the holidays, I mean.
Well, nothing till March, and then I' m the Easter Bunny.
Another?
Why not?
Merry Christmas.
Not a big talker.
No, not really.
- Buy you one?
- Why not?
Happy New Year.
You' re pretty regular for a Santa.
It' s just a job, you know what I mean?
I' m an eating, drinking, shitting, fucking Santy Claus.
Prove it.
Fuck me, Santa.
No.
I love the hat.
Okay.
I' ve always had a thing for Santa Claus.
In case you didn' t notice.
It' s like some deep- seated childhood thing.
So is my thing for tits.
It is like that, though.
From when you' re a kid.
'Cause my dad was Jewish, and we didn' t have Christmas.
So it was like this forbidden thing.
I like you.
Don' t mothball that suit.
I am not gay.
- Buddy?
I said I am not gay.
Are you off your fucking meds or something?
Yes.
But that isn' t what this is about.
You' re as queer as a $10 bill.
Let me tell you something, motherfucker.
My brother lost a goddamn arm fighting you fuckers in Vietnam.
So I want you to look at my face one last fucking time.
This is the last thing you' re ever gonna see before I...
- Motherfucker!
- Turn around, elf fucker.
Faggy Claus!
Leave Santa alone!
Little boy, don' t interfere.
I am doing this for all of us.
Leave Santa alone!
Ass clown.
Hey, you' re that kid.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Uh- huh.
I' m not your fucking dada.
- Uh- huh.
- You could twist them.
- Why do you need a car?
- What?
- This car.
Which turn is it?
Sage Terrace.
Where' s your sleigh?
It' s in the shop, getting repaired.
- Where are the reindeer?
- I stabled them.
Is it left or right?
That way.
Where' s the stable?
- Next to the shop.
- How do they sleep?
Standing up.
How do they sleep?
- What noise?
- From the shop.
They only work during the day, all right?
I thought it was always night at the North Pole.
Right now it' s always day.
Then how do they sleep?
Sage Terrace.
What is it with you?
Somebody drop you on your fucking head?
On my head?
Are they gonna drop you on somebody else' s head?
How can they drop me onto my own head?
Would...
Are you fucking with me?
Which house is it?
That one.
With Jesus and his family there or what?
The one beside that.
- Yeah.
That one.
Nice digs.
Is Daddy home?
He' s on an adventure, exploring mountains.
He' s been gone a long time.
How long is he gonna be gone?
Till next year.
What about Mommy?
She lives in God' s house with Jesus and Mary and the ghost and the long- eared donkey and Joseph and the talking walnut.
Grandma.
Yeah?
What' s her name?
Grandma.
Is Granny spry?
Grandma?
Santa' s here.
You' re home.
Are you spry?
Let me fix you some sandwiches.
Are you telling me she' s the only one here?
Nobody else?
No aunts or cousins or uncles or anything like that?
Nuh- unh.
You' re shitting me.
Does your daddy have a safe?
Need money to fix your sleigh?
Exactly.
You want milk and cookies?
No.
Unh- unh.
Does your daddy have a car?
Bye, Santa!
Oh, my!
- Keep going.
Keep it going.
Jesus Christ!
You ain' t gonna shit right for a week.
I can promise you that.
That' s all.
I forgot to take my pill.
It' s not just the swearing.
But did one of you, um... fornicate...
Fornicate?
Yes, with a heavyset woman in the Big & Tall dressing room.
But as far as I can recall, I' ve never fornicated anybody.
I think it' s best for all parties considered if we...
If we what?
Well, I have someone else interested in the position.
Before you do something stupid, you may want to think about this shit.
What are you talking about?
That' s what I' m talking about.
I' m talking about your face all over goddamn "USA Today."
I' m talking about 150 of these little motherfuckers all over the sidewalk out there.
Using little bullhorns and shit like that.
Screaming and hollering your name out.
Unfair practices.
Get me?
No, no.
This is not a handicap thing.
I have nothing against you people.
"You people"?
He said, "You people."
Wait.
Um, you know, I think it' s best if we just forget we had this conversation.
Good thinking.
We' il be fine.
Let' s get the hell out of here, Marcus.
You' re pathetic.
Check this out.
See what I' m saying?
You gotta move the ball around.
You go up there, baby.
Move the ball.
Motherfucker!
Oh, you lousy, fucking motherfucker.
That' s the shit that' s gonna get us pinched.
She said she was 18.
But you promised no arcades.
You said you' d only hustle Big & Tall.
You shat me out of your womb?
You' re my fucking mom now?
I don' t need any goddamn lectures.
Thank you.
What the fuck is this, Mr. Low Profile?
Mind your own goddamn business.
Ever hear of the open bottle law?
And I heard these...
Um, you know, these noises.
Oh, yeah. "
And I heard his voice saying, "That' s right.
You ain' t going to S- H- l- T right for a month. "
I was against the Clinton impeachment.
Oval Office, Women' s Big & Tall... it' s not for the American people to say.
Yeah, right.
And you are in a position of trust.
Oh, yeah.
Unfair practices.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
Fucking broads.
There' s something about the guy that makes me uneasy.
Santa fucking someone in the ass.
Maybe there' s something I could fire him for.
Do you?
Do you think you could find something?
Shit, yeah.
There' s always something.
Hey, Opal.
Come here.
Screw you, Willie, your kinky ass.
Last time I didn' t shit right for a week.
No, it' s not that.
I need to talk to you.
I' m just tired of you, Willie.
Who the fuck is in my room?
Did you see somebody go in my room?
Some guy asking about you.
Looked like a cop.
Oh, shit.
Marcus, it' s Willie.
Some guy is nosing around in my room.
What guy?
You get a look at him?
But I think he' s a cop, though.
Think somebody' s onto us?
Anything professional?
No, I just got clothes in there.
Just ditch, you idiot.
You got anywhere to sack out for a while?
You' re bringing my present early?
No.
But I never told you what I wanted.
I said I didn' t bring it, dipshit.
I want a stuffed elephant.
Wish in one hand, shit in the other one.
See which one fills up first.
So I' m gonna be staying here for a while.
Things are all fucked up at the North Pole.
Mrs. Santa caught me fucking her sister.
And I' m out on my ass now.
She got half of everything.
This is gonna be cool.
This will do fine.
So I' m gonna be crashing here.
It will be just you and me, like roommates, you know?
Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids?
Thank the fuck Christ.
What about the elves?
Well, they stay with Mrs. Santa.
I get them on the weekends.
Why don' t you go run me a bath?
What about the reindeer?
Would you please shut up about reindeer?
What are their names?
Who?
The elves.
I can' t remember.
There' s a Dopey.
That' s the Seven Dwarfs.
Oh, you' re shitting me.
I was thinking it was the...
I just call them, "bub."
I say, "Hey, bub" or "chief" or whatever the fuck.
I tell him to make the goddamn toy.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I can' t remember this shit!
Does everything with you have to be a fucking test?
How old are they?
You want cookies?
No.
No.
Should I fix you some sandwiches?
I don' t want any fucking sandwiches.
What is it with you and fixing fucking sandwiches?
Do you want anything else?
No.
What?
I brought you some orange juice.
What' s in it?
Oranges.
Look what I have.
An Advent calendar.
What the hell is that?
It' s the story of Christmas, but in a calendar.
And then there' s a chocolate inside.
Do you want to open up today' s box and read it?
You go ahead.
Watch the nuts.
"So Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of David.
In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
Everyone went to his hometown to register. "
- Yep.
That' s an awesome fucking story, kid.
There' s more to it, but we have to wait till tomorrow.
Do you want to eat the chocolate?
You go ahead.
Are you coming downstairs?
I got to go to work.
Fuck you.
You can' t just take up with some kid.
You don' t know who' s around or what they do.
You got some nerve, you little shit, you.
What, you' re my mom now?
You shat me out of your womb?
You said that yesterday, you stupid fuck.
Shit.
Fuck you.
You are by far the dumbest, most pathetic piece of maggot- eating shit that has ever slid from a human being' s hairy ass.
What if the kid has one of those fucking playdates they have now?
Are you shitting me?
The kid don' t have any friends.
He don' t even have an imaginary friend unless he ditched him.
He lives with his drooling- ass old grandmother.
Sits in front of the TV all the time.
You think she' s gonna rat me out?
She don' t know her ass from last Tuesday.
You fuck her?
Is everything fucking sex with you?
With me?
I fuck one person.
'cause I can' t stand what a piece of shit I am.
What are you, Sigmund Sawed- off Fucking Freud?
Talk about my height.
'cause you' re an emotional cripple.
Your soul is dog shit.
Every single fucking thing about you is ugly.
Let' s get out of here.
It' s Santa.
Let' s tell him what you want for Christmas.
I' m on my fucking lunch break, okay?
Are you insane?
Management' s gonna hear about this.
You think that' s a threat?
If you think you can make my life any worse, go right ahead.
Be my fucking guest.
Just looking.
Find everything you' re looking for?
Thank you.
Nothing I can help you with, huh?
I' m just looking at the games' cause I have an Xbox.
Get your hands out of my pants, man!
You' re stealing from the store, you' re stealing from me.
What is this?
I was gonna pay for it.
Wrong answer.
When I look at you, you know what I think?
I think America has a sad future ahead of it.
And you' re part of this sorry- ass generation.
What you want to be when you grow up?
I don' t know.
- Yeah.
Take it off.
But my grandmother gave...
Take it off.
Take it off.
I don' t care if it choke you to death.
Get!
Happy Kwanzaa.
And pull your damn pants up!
What' s wrong with you kids these days?
Gin?
- Yeah.
- What do you need?
I need you to run a plate for me.
It' s Arizona plates.
Let me get a pen.
Is that it?
For Christ' s sake, make a move and stick with it, would you?
King me.
Son of a bitch!
You lousy, cheating little shit!
You' re fucking with me!
You did that on purpose.
You play like the dead lice are falling off of you, and then suddenly, you' re like Seabiscuit all over the place.
You' re a smartass, is what you are, kid.
Want to play again?
Herb Gunner.
I live two streets over on Burning Trail Road.
I don' t think we' ve met.
I' m Uncle Willie.
I' m organizing the decorations for the subdivision this year.
- You mind if I come in?
- Yeah.
I mean yeah, I mind.
Will you be participating in our luminarias program this year?
- What the hell is a lunamaria?
- They' re luminarias.
We insert a candle in the middle, light it, and the bag glows.
Then we line all the sidewalks here all around the neighborhood.
You see, we don' t celebrate Christmas around here, so...
We' re, uh, we' re Muslims.
Look, it' s my first year running this.
I' d like it if there weren' t any gaps in it.
What if I come by Christmas Eve and do it for you?
You don' t have to do that.
Yeah, me and the kid here, we' il do something.
- I' il throw them in the garage.
- Perfect.
Awesome.
Going in the garage, just so you know.
Fuck me, Santa.
This is such a nice house.
Needs a woman' s touch, though.
I just rent the fucking place anyway.
Yeah?
How long are you gonna be here?
On the couch?
In town.
Just through the holidays.
You know, then I' il move on.
So, do you like kids?
Fuck, no!
Do you think I' m some kind of pervert?
I just mean because you' re Santa Claus.
I really like kids.
- You do?
- I love kids.
Well, good.
Yeah, they' re something else, those kids.
And to tell you the truth...
The fact of the matter is, I' m not Santa.
Like ya anyway.
Yeah.
I' il call you.
I' m gonna buy you some flowers.
Some of those really good expensive ones.
Shut up.
Roger, you' re home.
Let me fix you some sandwiches.
Kid, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Let me see it!
What the hell happened to you?!
I cut my hand by mistake!
- Ow!
Hold still.
I was just trying to help you!
I forgot to say, "It' s gonna sting a little bit."
Shouldn' t I wrap it in a T- shirt or something?
God damn it.
- Hey, kid?
Kid, you okay up there?
You need a Band- Aid or something?
Aw, shit.
You' re late.
Let me tell you.
They run you ragged.
Morning, team.
It' s not quite 8: 00 yet.
Well, how close are we?
Now it' s 8: 00.
Merry Christmas.
Up your ass.
God damn it!
You tear your ball again?
I don' t think so.
That' s it.
God damn it!
Go on and get in there.
I can take it.
Gin, I got the info on that Arizona plate.
Now you' re talking.
Oh, hold on one minute.
Don' t use that one.
Use something with some claws to it.
Yeah, that hard candy.
That' s it right there.
Yeah, that' s it.
Yeah, I' m back.
The guy' s Roger Merman.
- Guess where he is.
- Give it to me.
What' s wrong with you, woman?
Who are you?
Your name Roger Merman?
Yes.
You doing three to six for embezzlement?
Uh, well, many accounting questions are not cut- and- dried.
Do you live at 41 Sage Terrace?
Is it Grandma?
Is my son all right?
They' re fine.
Do you have any houseguests?
Houseguests?
God bless.
Well, hey, who are you?
Houseguests?
Little trick I learned up at the North Pole.
If you fry baloney, it tastes like a hot dog.
I thought you didn' t like sandwiches.
Yeah, but this is not a sandwich.
A sandwich has two pieces of bread with a bunch of junk on it.
It' s like a tostada.
This isn' t a tostada.
There you go, Granny.
Little salsa here.
Now it' s a tostada.
Have you seen my Advent calendar?
What the fuck is it with the Advent calendar?
Why are you so obsessed with that goddamn thing?
The story sucks anyway.
I think I saw it in the hallway.
- Really?
- I think so.
Looks like someone messed with my Advent calendar.
What are you talking about?
Let me see.
Nobody messed with it.
It looks fine.
There' s a candy corn in this one.
Well, they can' t all be winners, can they?
Well, it' s fucked.
- Fucked, frankly.
- He' s...
- Clean...
- As a fucking whistle.
- Nothing?
- Oh.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- But never around children.
- Yeah.
- No parking tickets.
- Nothing.
- Oh.
Sex, yeah.
- But man is a sexual being.
- Fuckin 'Darwinian.
- You can' t do shit about that.
Hell, I wouldn' t want to.
No, of course not.
I' m not advocating celibacy.
It' d be the end of the fucking human race.
Fucks large women.
What can I say?
Hey, look, it' s the retard again.
- Yeah.
Well, what the hell do you want?
Pokémon!
Done.
You probably shouldn' t be digging in your ass.
- Is that your underwear?
- Part of it.
Where the hell' s the rest of it?
No, actually, don' t tell me.
What do you want?
I was thinking I wanted a purple stuffed elephant, not pink.
But now I changed my mind.
- Yeah, what?
He could take his orders from the talking walnut, so it wouldn' t be my bad thing.
Jesus, kid.
When I was your age, I didn' t need no gorilla, and I wasn' t as big as one of your legs.
- You know what he did?
- He made it all better?
You know why?
'Cause you went to the bathroom on Mommy' s dishes?
What the fuck?
No.
He tried to teach you not to cry and be a man?
No.
It' s because he was a mean, drunk son of a bitch.
When he wasn' t busting my ass, he was putting cigarettes out on my neck.
The world ain' t fair.
You gotta take what you need when you can get it.
Learn to stand up for yourself.
Kick these kids in the balls or something.
Or don' t.
Just leave me out of it.
Now, get on out of here.
Okay.
Thanks, Santa.
Go get the next lucky boy or girl, okay?
Open the ropes there, Marcus.
I know you?
Not yet.
Seven cities in seven years.
Pretty impressive.
The store changes, your name changes.
But you always get away clean.
Pretty darn impressive.
You, because of your physical attributes, found a niche, and I respect that.
But you also been caught...... by me.
So this is how it' s gonna be.
I don' t want to take over.
I don' t even want to change your scam.
All I want is a taste.
When the deed is done, we part ways.
I' il buy a little ranch in Havasu, and you all take your little medicine show back on the road.
- How much?
No way!
You don' t know who you' re fucking with.
I got this.
Okay.
30%.
Half.
I meant 33%...
I meant half.... and 1/ 3.
Half.
35%.
Half.
40%.
Half.
42%.
45%.
Half.
48%?
Half.
49%.
Half.
Well, what' s one point?
We split the dough right down the middle.
Any merchandise you take, I get to look at and cherry- pick.
No!
Money' s one thing, but you ain' t gettin 'the...
This ain' t no Chinese menu, jagoff.
I tell you how it' s gonna be.
This is pricks fix.
Pricks fix?
He' s a fucking moron.
Oh, really?
Is that how you got the upper hand?
Fuck you.
Negotiating?
If you don' t like, next year, fuck off.
I can always get another box jockey.
I can get another midget, too.
Yeah, where?
You see us hanging off of trees like fucking crab apples?
Even if we did, you' d never front your own racket.
You know why, Willie?
You got zero fuckin 'initiative.
You' d fall apart without me.
You' re too pathetic for words.
You' re a fucking loser, and you fucking know it.
Santa' il be here real soon, kids.
Sweet Jews for Jesus.
I pissed myself.
What the fuck do you think you doing?
You son of a bitch!
Get him out of here.
I' il smooth things over with Chipeska.
- Tell him food poisoning.
- "Get him out of here"?
Take him to the car.
In case you hadn' t noticed, I' m a motherfuckin 'dwarf.
So unless you got a forklift handy, maybe you should lend a hand, hmm?
That figures.
You want all kind of set- asides.
Special treatment 'cause you' re handicapped.
You all the same.
Special treatment?
I' m 3- foot- fucking- tall, you asshole!
It' s a matter of physics.
Draw me a sketch of how I get him to the car, huh?
Sketch it up, you moron.
Fucking Leonardo da Vinci.
What you call me, thigh high?
I called you a fucking guinea homo from the 15th- fucking- century, you dickhead!
I could stick you up my ass, small fry.
Yeah?
You sure it ain' t too sore from last night?
You got some lip on you, midget.
Well, these lips were on your wife' s pussy last night.
Why don' t you dust that thing off once in a while?
Asshole.
I pissed my pants.
Oh, shut up.
What?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You going to work today?
Not really.
You just gonna sit there?
Just let me alone, okay?
Yeah?
I want you to take this letter.
When the paramedics come to bag Santa up, there' s gonna be some cops there.
I want you to make sure that those cops get that envelope.
What is it?
It just tells all the bad things that...
What the fuck happened to your eye?
So you like to give little kids black eyes, huh?
You want some?!
Come on!
You know, I think I' ve turned a corner.
You fucking petites now?
No.
I' m not talking about that.
I beat the shit out of some kids today.
But it was for a purpose.
It made me feel good about myself.
I don' t know.
Like I accomplished something.
You need many years of therapy.
Many, many, many fuckin 'years of therapy.
You don' t drink, which is smart on your part.
But being sober can put you at a disadvantage when it comes to violence.
I can' t box worth a shit, see.
But I' m good in a fight because I can' t feel anything.
You, you' re gonna feel everything.
Now put your dukes up.
Let me see what you got.
This is bullshit!
Give me one good reason why I should even consider doing this.
That' s why.
Now, I' m asking you for this one thing.
Come on, look at the kid.
Yeah, he' s just a little...
He' s a fucking retard.
Yeah, let' s show him a couple of things so he can defend himself, then.
Unless you' re scared.
All right, here' s what' s gonna happen.
Marcus is a bully, right?
He' s gonna pull your underwear up out of your pants.
Now, what do you do?
I don' t know.
You don' t know?
If somebody wants to pull your underwear up out of your pants, you have to get mad.
Get mad.
Scream at him.
Jesus fucking Christ.
He' s a fucking faggot.
Loud!
Scream!
Be mean!
Come on!
You don' t hit people in the balls, you asshole!
What the fuck' s wrong with you?
He' s just a kid.
Making me...
Kid, maybe you shouldn' t spend so much time around me.
You sneaky little prick.
Oh, God damn it, I forgot about that.
We got a fucking nursing home around here.
Well, we can go in another room.
She does look kind of still, doesn' t she?
Hey, Granny?
Hey, there, Granny?
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?
Oh, shit.
- God damn it!
Shit!
- You' re home.
- Please just tap me.
- Let me fix some sandwiches.
Hello, little boy.
Hello.
Santa...
I know that Christmas Eve is in a couple days, and you have to fly around the world and give presents to everyone, and you won' t be around anymore.
Yeah?
So I thought I' d give you your present now.
What the fuck is it?
It' s a wooden pickle.
- Why' d you paint it brown?
It' s blood from when I cut my hand making it for you.
Well, shit, kid, I don' t know.
Thanks.
You' re welcome.
Good night, Santa.
Good night, Mrs. Santa' s sister.
Good night, sweetie.
Oh, my God.
That was so sweet.
He' s a really sweet kid, isn' t he?
Yeah, I guess so.
Come on, baby.
Come here.
What?
I' m all right.
Just a little tired.
Want to see my report card?
You scared the holy shit out of me.
Think I did good?
How would I know?
I haven' t seen the fuckin 'thing yet.
Who the fuck is Thurman?
- Is your name Thurman?
Thurman Merman?
Yeah.
Jesus.
So, you think I did good?
What do you care what I think, anyway?
Hell, I guess you did better than I did.
I never got any B' s.
I thought maybe at least since I did good in school, maybe you' d bring me a present.
'Cause last year and the year before that, you didn' t bring me any presents.
Even though I' m a dipshit loser.
Why do you talk about yourself that way?!
Let me give you some news.
I' m not Santa Claus, all right?
Do I look like Santa Claus?
As a matter of fact, I' m living fucking proof that there' s not a Santa Claus.
I know there' s no Santa.
'cause we' re friends.
That lousy, leather- faced, frog- eyed, motherfucker.
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.
What is the problem now?
The van stalled.
Will you give us a jump, please?
I' il be dipped in dog shit.
Do I look like an auto mechanic to you?
I appreciate it.
All right, small fry, help yourself.
I can' t reach it.
Jesus Christ, give me that.
Thanks.
All right, hit it.
What a terrible accident.
- Is he dead?
- No.
But it looks like you broke most of his ribs.
I' d say maybe 50% of them, or do you think 30%?
I needed more of a running start.
I couldn' t build up enough speed.
Merry Christmas Eve.
Got you a little something.
You shouldn' t have.
You should put that stuff in the kitchen.
God damn, you look good.
Little behind there, sweetie?
We don' t need any more of this shit.
"Christmas keeps us connected to each other in peace.
The angel is going to tell everyone in the world. "
Aspirin?
- What?
- I was gonna make sandwiches.
I could make you one before you leave.
Listen, kid, I don' t know.
I got shit to do and everything.
Okay, make me some sandwiches.
I gotta go to the mall and talk to somebody.
I' il be back.
For dinner?
Yeah, that' s what I said.
How many sandwiches do you want?
Uh, a bunch.
How much lettuce do you want?
I don' t know.
The usual amount.
Whatever you think.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Okay!
Happy holiday!
Attention, shoppers.
The store will be closing in five minutes.
We wish you all a merry Christmas, a happy Hanukkah, and a joyous Kwanzaa.
All right, hold it steady.
Oh, yeah, shit, let' s do it.
Oh, Christ.
Merry Christmas.
Good night.
Merry Christmas, Willie.
Up your ass.
Oh, shit.
What?
It' s a Kitnerboy Redoubt.
So?
Remember Andy Pitz?
Andy Pitzorella?
Yeah.
No, Andy Ripitski.
Andy Pitzorella was Andy Blue Balls.
Since he got married, they call him Andy Pitzorella.
What' s your fucking point?!
They say he can get into anything.
Anything.
They say he' s been in Margaret Thatcher' s pussy.
And that' s a good thing?
So what the fuck are you getting at?
When I was in the joint with him, he told me that the Kitnerboy Redoubt can' t be cracked.
Are you shittin 'me?
Are you telling me that after I propped you up, held you together, smiled for all those kids, danced for all those fucking housewives in a fucking lime- green, fucking velvet elf costume, that you cannot get in this fucking safe?!
Huh?!
No, I' m just saying it' s gonna take a minute.
34C.
Piece of cake.
I' il be right back.
Which one did he say?
I' il bet the store dick don' t want this.
Store dick don' t want shit.
What do you mean?
Store dick' s dead.
Store dick don' t want shit.
He' s dead, huh?
I didn' t even know he was sick.
Willie... this has been a long time coming.
Every year, you' re worse.
Every year, less reliable.
More buttfucking.
Sure, the three B' s.
You gotta be able to rely, Willie.
You people are monsters.
There' s no joy in this for me.
I' m not talking about you taking me out.
That part, I get.
But look at all that shit.
Do you really need all that shit?
For Christ sakes, it' s Christmas.
But this is what we do.
We get the shit.
Christmastime, we get the shit.
Because we are men and Lois.
And we are men and Lois.
What you waiting for, honey?
Come on, plug him.
Goodbye, Willie.
- Drop the gun.
And you, Santa, drop the elephant.
- Where did you come from?
- Tipped off.
Shit, that fucking kid.
All three of you are in so much shit, it' s almost unbelievable.
Marcus, hop on!
Fuck me.
This is Christmas, and the kid' s getting his fucking present.
"Dear kid...
I hope that you got my present and that there wasn' t too much blood on it, although there was blood on the present you gave me, which didn' t keep me from enjoying it.
So maybe the blood doesn' t matter so much, I guess. "
I' m also sending you a T- shirt.
I hope it' s the right size. "
"I' m healing up good, and they tell me that I will soon be 100%, even with 8 bullets dug out of me, because they didn' t hit any vital organs, just my liver, which is fucked anyway.
Ha ha ha.
Thank you for giving that letter to the cops.
I forgot I asked you to do it, but it' s a good thing you did or Santa' s little helper would' ve plugged his ass.
Now the cops know I wrote it, which is gonna keep my ass out of jail.
That, plus everyone agreeing that the Phoenix police shooting an unarmed Santa was even more fucked up than Rodney King. "
"The cops are treating me like fucking royalty now, which is new in my experience.
They' re gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department.
I told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with Mrs. Santa' s sister watching you till your dad gets back in one year and three months.
They made her a guardian pro tem or some such shit.
Anyway, she seems to like you and your house and Jacuzzi.
I sent her some money, so if you play your cards right, you can probably get her to buy you something.
As for my little helper, I' m sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune- faced, mail- order wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad.
like I did.
They' re supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon, so get some sandwiches ready.
least of all yourself.
Your pal, Santa. "
Hey, loser.
I hear your buddy' s not here to protect you anymore.
See you got me a new bike.
Thanks a lot.
I' m talking to you, fat- ass!
I miss you.
Testing.
Testing.
- Hey, Brit.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- I' m okay.
Don' t worry, sweetie.
It' il be okay.
Your mom will always be with you.
Seniors.
Quiet down.
Seniors!
This party atmosphere quite simply has to stop.
Move.
God, bitch!
No wonder they held her back twice.
Maya, I heard Principal Mosster' s making you work the school paper.
Yeah, that or juvie.
Now, I' m joined today by Detective Morrison and Coroner Haynes.
They' re here to enlighten you on the dangers of excess.
Now, listen up.
Detective.
- I can promise you all one thing.
- That this will be short?
That if you party too hard for the rest of this school year...... we' re the people you' re gonna meet.
I' ve seen it too many times to even count.
A kid gets a hold of some alcohol, maybe some drugs...... and you don' t know when enough is enough.
Call goes out...... and that' s where the coroner, Dr. Haynes, comes in.
That' s where I come in.
And a few days later...... a badly decomposed corpse washes up on the beach.
It becomes my job to identify the body.
- And do you know how I do that?
- Dental records.
- Kiss ass.
- Yeah.
It' s a sad and sorry task, but yes, that' s how it' s done.
And if there' s no dental records?
Well, then we would have to carry out a DNA analysis...
-... of the corpse' s bone marrow.
- That' s fucked up.
It' s not that difficult of a process.
You take the bone marrow and grind it up in these little pieces...... and then you add in some dye elements and some chemicals...... and you put that all in an agarose gel.
- Get it up!
- Then you take your gel and put that....
My apologies, detective.
It' s so hard to keep their attention, especially today.
- Why, what' s today?
- The district volleyball final.
They love their volleyball here at Blue Bay.
Can' t think why.
Blue Bay sucks!
Here' s a new angle on the Brittney Havers story.
Forget that whole preppy, popular- girl bullshit.
Let' s go deeper.
Let' s expose how little Miss Trailer Park...... became the richest bitch at Blue Bay High.
Get it up!
Let' s go!
- Come on!
- Yeah!
Good shot.
Come on!
Almost, Brittney.
You suck!
All right, let' s go!
Get it on!
Close.
Very close.
The suspense is killing me.
Party at your house, Brit.
Blue Bay!
Blue Bay!
Blue Bay!
Hey, Brit, what' s up?
I' il be in a world of shit when my stepfather finds out about this.
Have fun.
It' s a party.
Look at those guys.
They' re college guys, frat guys.
I think they' re Zeta Pis...... or KOK.
I' m not really sure.
Come on, have fun.
What' s wrong with you?
Look!
What are you doing?!
Just giving her a little makeover.
I want everybody out of my house, right now!
Out!
Not me.
What' s her fucking problem?
That' s her dead mother' s portrait, you dumb- ass.
I' m sorry, Brit.
They' re just assholes.
I messed up bad this time.
Why don' t you marry a millionaire, just like your dear, dead mother?
What the hell are you doing here?
Thought I' d write a story for the school rag.
"Gator white trash makes good."
- What you think?
- Don' t you dare, you bitch.
So...... tell me what your poor, desperate, alcoholic mother...... ever saw in booty- chasing millionaire Niles Dunlap.
Why don' t you get the fuck out of here?
You may fool your cardboard- cutout friends...... but I still remember where you came from.
You can take the girl out of the trailer park...... but you can' t take the trailer park out of the girl.
Out of my fucking house before I call the police!
Trouble in paradise?
I' m not gonna say it again!
Out of my fucking house before I call the police!
I said, now!
You can stay.
Great party, Mr. Dunlap.
I didn' t --
Well...... that' s trash.
Like mother, like daughter.
Green, baby.
You know what that is?
Cash!
Cash!
Everything around me!
You have my cash?
Do you?
You remember me, right?
Bald head, tall, glasses.
Where' s my money?
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?
You think you' re a gambler?
A hundred.
Two hundred.
That' s enough.
Look at me.
- Oh, my God!
- l' il blow your fucking head off!
Next time I' m here, your whole family --
Niles?
What happened?
Nothing.
Who was that guy?
It' s none of your business, okay?
I' m leaving tomorrow, and you pull this party shit?
How am I supposed to trust you now?
I' m sorry, okay?
You can trust me, Dad.
Stepdad.
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah, it' s just....
What' s up?
There was just this guy at the house last night.
- What happened?
- No, nothing like that.
What, then?
Just forget about it.
Tell me about the guy, Brit.
- Was it one of those cute frat guys?
- No.
Come on.
Tell me.
There was a man threatening Niles with a gun.
Seriously?
Jesus.
When I asked Niles about it...... all he did was give me shit about the party.
I' m sorry.
What are you gonna do?
I don' t want to talk about this right now.
Let' s go to practice.
Hey, Brit.
Brit.
Principal' s looking for you.
Call you back.
Brittney.
What is it?
Maybe you' d better sit down.
Last time you asked me to do that, my mother was dead.
There' s been an accident.
No.
No, not again.
Afternoon, detective.
lnsurance investigator.
Great.
Any word on what caused the crash, if you don' t mind me asking?
I do mind.
We' re on the same team.
We' re both looking for answers.
I' m looking to wrap this up and go home.
- You' re looking to find trouble.
- I' m just trying to do my job.
What' s your job?
Scratch a wound till it bleeds?
What happened here is the guy took on gravity and he lost.
That simple enough for you?
Nothing is ever as simple as it appears.
Hey, look around you, pal.
This is a police investigation.
You don' t belong here.
So pay that girl her check and go back to wherever you came from.
Detective.
What do you got?
- Looks like swamp rats.
- They probably went in after the body.
Excuse me.
You ever hear of a rat running into a burning airplane?
I' m sorry to be bothering you.
- I know this isn' t an easy time for you.
- Something wrong?
We....
We found rats in the fuselage of Niles' airplane.
- They' d chewed through the wiring.
- Are you serious?
Like somebody put them there on purpose.
You know anybody who may have been angry...... or had a grudge against your stepfather?
What about that guy you told me about?
The one that threatened Niles.
Wanna tell me something?
What did I tell you?
You think you' re a gambler?
A hundred.
Two hundred.
That' s enough.
I' m gonna fucking --
I' m gonna have to take that tape.
According to Mr. Dunlap' s will, Miss Havers shall be furnished a stipend...... until she graduates from a college of her choice.
After that, she' il be provided with a small trust.
- How small are we talking? - $25, 000 a year for life. $25, 000 a year?
What about controlling interest in the company?
His 51 percent will revert to the corporate trust...... of which the board will supervise, subject to the provisions of the will.
There must be some kind of mistake.
I' m afraid not, Miss Havers.
What were the provisions?
That the money would go to a blood heir, if Mr. Dunlap had one.
Otherwise, the trust is to donate the money...... to Mr. Dunlap' s favourite country club.
This is bullshit.
What --?
These are your stepfather' s last wishes.
ls there any other money?
Mr. Dunlap took out a $2 million life- insurance policy last year.
But with no heir, I' m afraid that also reverts to the trust.
That' s it?
A lot of people live very well on $25, 000 a year.
ln the Glades, maybe.
We' il have the papers ready for you to sign in front of the judge tomorrow.
- Term National.
- lt' s me.
Well, how' s life in Blue Bay with the rich and shameless?
Same shit, different day.
Listen, Lacey, I need you to do me a favour.
Give me everything you can on Niles Dunlap.
l want the good, the bad, the ugly.
- Where are you going with all this, T.?
- I smell a rat.
What up, boss?
Thought you fulfilled your weekly hours.
Got another angle on the Brittney Havers story.
This shit ain' t gonna sell.
You need to think sensational.
That' s what I' m talking about.
That' s kind of disrespectful to Brittney.
Fuck her if she can' t take a joke.
But with the will, I' m sure she doesn' t need any more bad news.
What about the will?
I heard she lost out on everything except 25 grand a year.
All his money' s going to the country club...... unless they can find a blood relative.
That fucker must have been worth a boat load.
Sixty- five mil, according to Forbes.
Honey, you need to get out more.
Perfect.
Let' s see what we got here.
I' m afraid there' s not much we can do for the little fella.
I didn' t think so, doctor.
What I need here is some information.
What kind of information?
Where did this thing come from?
Why was it found in the control panel of a downed airplane?
- You really loved this rat, didn' t you?
This could be worth 2 million.
Okay, I' il run some tests.
Thanks.
- Sure, buddy.
Yeah, you rat.
Crime figures are down for one reason only.
Hard work and dedication of men and women of this department.
I' m in the middle of this dog and pony show.
- We got it.
- What?
The guy from the security tape.
Fax came from Miami P. D.
Small- time hood runs backroom gambling joints for the Cuban Mafia.
I' il call you back.
There she is!
Everything' s fine, Brittney.
Come on.
- What' s going on?
- There' s a wrinkle in Dunlap' s will.
What do you mean?
The clause about a blood relative getting the money.
Come on, make some room.
Back off.
She doesn' t have a comment.
No, she is lying!
I will not tolerate another outburst in my courtroom.
I understand that this is hard for you, but you will respect this process.
Now, Miss King, will you please continue.
Like I said, Niles Dunlap was my father.
You lying little bitch!
Order in the court!
Order!
Order!
Order!
Court' s adjourned.
We' il try again tomorrow, with a little more decorum, perhaps.
- Bridge.
- It' s me.
- You' re working late.
- You got Cragen' s panties in a bunch.
He' s scared you' il lose out on a big payout.
You tell him not to worry.
Bridge will bring this home.
What you got on Dunlap?
Okay.
Twice divorced.
Brittney' s mother was the last wife.
Committed suicide a year ago.
It was real nasty too.
Took a long car ride off a very short jetty.
She' d found out about his reputation with the ladies.
What kind of reputation?
He' s seen more pussy than an animal shelter.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Had a world- famous wine collection in the cellar of his $1 0 million mansion.
I wouldn' t expect anything less from a corporate tyrant.
- That it?
- I always have more for you, T.
He was also a big- time gambler.
Seedy backrooms in Miami, as well as legit tables in Biloxi and Atlantic City.
Wouldn' t bat an eyelid at dropping a mil or two.
He was compulsive.
He learned to fly so he could squeeze in a little more time at the tables.
Even taught stepdaughter Brittney to fly so he could down a cocktail or two.
Very interesting.
I overnighted Dunlap' s medical records.
Thanks, Lacey.
You' re the best. -- where high- school student Maya King came forward...... claiming to be the illegitimate daughter of Niles Dunlap.
The room exploded in chaos when Brittney Havers...... attacked Miss King upon hearing the news.
Bailiffs restrained Miss Havers...... before the judge ordered the court adjourned for the day.
Plot thickens.
- And these are?
- Letters, Your Honour.
- From Mr. Dunlap to my mother.
- Love letters?
No, I wouldn' t call them that.
When were they written?
Summer of '84.
My mother worked in the Dunlap mansion.
One of her three jobs.
For the first month, he didn' t even talk to her.
lgnored her like she was a piece of trash.
But then one evening, that all changed.
Suddenly he was all over her like a rash.
A few weeks later, she exploded the myth...... you can' t get pregnant your first time.
The very same day he fired her, he cut her a check...... gave her the name of a doctor he wanted her to see.
Needless to say, she didn' t know what he wanted her to do with the money.
How could he not see the crucifix around her neck?
This is an outrage!
We' re dragging a respected man through the mud...... based on the testimony of a less than reliable witness.
I will not tolerate any more interruptions!
- Miss King.
- I' m sorry.
It' s just --
It still hurts to think about.
Mom put me in foster homes when she needed to save money.
I haven' t spoken to her in a couple of years.
Last I heard, she moved to Puerto Rico.
I went through her personal stuff after she skipped town...... and that' s when I found those letters.
All from Niles.
All threatening her...... if she revealed that he was my father.
Order!
Order!
Miss King.
You' il be required to submit to a DNA test...... which will be matched to the late Mr. Dunlap.
- Really?
- The results will be back in two days.
At which time this court will make a final ruling.
Court dismissed.
There you go.
- Thanks.
- Let' s go.
Now, what do we have here?
Niles Dunlap, exhumation for DNA testing.
That' s a killer.
- Cancer sticks.
- Everybody dies, believe me.
- I' m sorry, I didn' t catch your name.
- Terence.
Terence Bridge.
Term National Life lnsurance.
Well, Mr. Dunlap must be an important client of yours, huh?
He was.
I wrote the policy myself.
Now I' m on the hook for 2 million.
It' s gotta be a pain in the ass for you, this whole mess.
It' s no big deal.
Let me know?
- You' il be the first to know.
- Great.
Now, if you' il excuse me, I gotta open this up.
I appreciate your help.
See you when I see you.
Yeah.
You sure you don' t want some company tonight?
I just need some time to think.
Bye.
You want to dance with me, baby?
- You want to dance?
- What do you want?
What I' m owed.
- I don' t owe you anything.
Seven fucking million dollars.
That debt don' t die with him!
Look at me.
Three days, I' il be back, mija.
And you don' t want to fuck with me, muchacha.
Cicatriz.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth?
I do.
Dr. Haynes, have you completed the DNA tests?
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Let me see them.
And are you satisfied with these results?
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Very well.
"The DNA taken from the person of Maya King...... and checked against that of Niles Dunlap...... is a genetic match.
It is the opinion of the coroner' s office...... that Niles Dunlap is indeed the blood father of Maya King. "
As per the will, Mr. Dunlap' s 51 percent controlling interest...... in the Dunlap Corporation goes to Miss Maya King.
Court adjourned.
Miss Havers was led away in tears after the ruling.
Miss King stands to inherit the shares of the Dunlap Corporation...... valued at approximately $70 million.
ln a related story, a Cuban national was detained here...... on suspicion of murder in the crash of Niles Dunlap.
Thank you, Linda.
Mr. Cicatriz was taken into custody today...... at his home in Valley View.
No word yet on what specific charges....
They got him.
Christ, Mr. Bridge, don' t you ever sleep?
I did, once.
It' s overrated.
Well, come in if you' re coming in.
What did you find out about our rodent friend?
A few bits and pieces.
I' il tell you one thing.
- That was no ordinary swamp rat.
- What do you mean?
Wasn' t quite sure myself, so I ran some tests.
I love rats.
They' re amazing.
They can survive a five- story fall, swim for six hours...... crawl though a hole size of a quarter.
Scavengers.
But not this guy.
He wasn' t settling for scraps of garbage.
He had a taste for the finer things in life.
- Like what?
- Like this.
I found it in its stomach with mould residue.
- Mould residue?
- From an expensive bottle of wine.
I' d say at least 20 years old.
Trendy rat.
Yeah.
I think it' s time to celebrate.
Oh, shit.
Why don' t you just kill those fucking things?
That' s a $2000 bottle of wine.
You know I' m good for it.
- We did it.
- We did it, didn' t we?
I saw they arrested the Cuban guy...... and they' re charging him with Niles' murder.
See?
What did I tell you?
That cop just wants all his cases tied up in a pretty little bow.
Nothing' s over until it' s over.
We haven' t even sold the company shares yet.
Nothing' s foolproof, girls.
Quit worrying.
This is the last time we' il be together before the money' s in the bank.
Let' s make the most of it.
Come here.
Now kiss him.
Beautiful, but deadly.
Do I know you?
The name' s Terence Bridge.
I' m handling your stepfather' s insurance claim.
lf you' re talking about Niles' $2 million policy...... you' re talking to the wrong person.
The melaleuca tree.
Beautiful to look at...... but all it does is suck up the water around it until nothing is left.
Everything dies around them.
Really?
That' s fascinating.
You know they found rats in your stepfather' s plane.
Detective Morrison told me.
Now, if you' il excuse me.
Rough night last night, huh?
Few too many drinks?
Must be tough to know when to stop...... when you have the most extensive wine collection.
What' s your point?
Just learned a long time ago...... when something doesn' t add up, you seek out the oddity.
Good luck with that.
Do you happen to have a rodent problem?
Just you.
Who the hell does she think she is?
That' s Brittney' s spot.
Hey, you' re parked in Brittney' s spot.
Haven' t you heard?
She' s out.
I' m in.
So can I join your little Nazi fashion clique now?
You' re trash.
You always have been, and you always will be.
Dyke.
Maya.
What the fuck are you doing here?
lf somebody sees us --
Come here.
- What is it?
- The insurance guy, Bridge...... was asking me about wine collections and rats.
- And rats!
- So?
He fucking knows!
- Don' t be so paranoid.
The insurance creep is on the hook for 2 mil.
He doesn' t care about anything else.
- lf he goes to the police?
- He has nothing.
What if the Cuban guy gets out of prison?
He' il come after me.
- He' il come after me.
- Don' t sweat your pretty little head.
I' il take care of you.
- We' re in the clear.
- Maybe.
I want to fuck you so bad.
ls this a bad time, doctor?
Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack.
Well, we' re in the right place for that.
What' s on your mind, Mr. Bridge?
Niles Dunlap' s medical record.
The man was 50 years old and more physically fit than a man half his age.
Yeah.
A strong heart, low cholesterol.
ln fact, aside from some bouts with chicken pox...... and scarlet fever as a child, his medical record is unblemished.
That' s good for him.
Doesn' t help him now that he' s toast, but good for him.
Just out of curiosity, what are the long- term effects of scarlet fever?
That depends on the severity of the infection.
lf it was real bad, it could cause a heart murmur...... or sometimes eye or ear damage.
Or sterility.
Sometimes.
Now, what if, and this is just a "what if"...... Niles Dunlap was sterile?
Well, that' s impossible.
- You see, Miss King proved that -- - I know.
I know, I know.
The DNA was a perfect match.
You ran the test yourself.
Right.
But it would throw a real monkey wrench into the works, wouldn' t it?
Wouldn' t it?
lf he was sterile?
Sorry, I don' t wanna waste any more of your time.
lf you think of anything you can tell me...
All right?
- Great.
Harvard man, I see.
Yeah. l --
I went to Morehouse.
But I' m just trying to figure out...... how a big- time education at Harvard can land someone like yourself...... at some small- town coroner' s job.
Just seems odd.
See you when I see you.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
That insurance agent' s crawling up my fucking ass.
Get the fuck in the house.
Come on!
You fucking idiot, let' s go.
Damn it.
lf he could prove anything, he wouldn' t be an insurance agent, would he?
He' s just fucking with you, see if you' il crack.
Crack?
- I don' t think I' il get through this.
- Yes, you will.
Just think about the 7 0 million.
And this.
So how did you do it, Maya?
How did you get the DNA to match?
What the fuck you doing here?
I was just looking for Maya King' s place.
Well, you' re looking at it.
I was --
Look, man, I' m an insurance...... agent.
Hey, whoa, just take it easy, okay?
I' m just trying to give you my business card.
Here.
Want some light?
All right.
Here.
What do you want with her?
Well, you know, she stands to inherit a large sum of money.
From Bobby Santiago?
I very much fucking doubt that.
Bobby who?
Her father.
Probably.
You never can tell.
Hung around here when he wasn' t doing time.
Died on the business end of a pig sticker in Tallahassee a year back.
Really sorry to hear that.
You wouldn' t happen to know where he would be buried?
County dumped his box in the ground out at Sapienza Hill.
Sapienza Hill.
- Hello?
- Fucking Julian.
Maya, what' s wrong?
He' s losing it.
That insurance investigator' s nosing around...... and Julian can' t take the fucking heat.
He wouldn' t do anything stupid, would he?
Abso- fucking- lutely.
We gotta deal with him.
What do you mean, "deal with him"?
We never planned on cutting him in.
Let' s think about this before we do anything.
Don' t think, Brit.
Just sit there and look pretty, and we' il be together forever.
Papa King.
All right, Miss King, if we can get your signature here.
And...... here.
All right.
All right?
We' re finished here.
That' s it?
Seventy million dollars.
Seventy fucking million dollars!
Yes!
Sixty- nine million, 427 thousand, to be exact.
Now, you' re sure you don' t wanna transfer this to an account?
No, thank you.
A company check will do just fine.
- Hello?
- lt' s don e.
I got the check in my hand.
All right, calm down.
We still got shit to do.
We meet Julian at midnight.
You know where.
I' ve been thinking about this --
No, you' re not.
We stick to the plan.
Damn it.
So you have something to hide after all, huh?
Maya?
Maya?
Look, don' t fuck around with me right now, please.
Maya?
Shit!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Glad you could make it, Brit.
Let' s go.
You' re such a puss.
Remember when we came here with Andy and his brother Ross?
We need to talk.
He does not deserve this.
- The plan' s a mistake.
- No, it' s not.
- Knock it off.
Oh, pumpkin.
- What is wrong with you?
- It' s not gonna bite you.
Let me show you...... how to use it.
Come on, put your hand on it.
Hold on to that and open it up.
Good.
Now, I want you to...... gently put them in.
Slowly.
Slide them all the way down.
That' s it.
Slowly.
Then close it up.
And raise it all the way up.
Now, all you have to do...
-... is squeeze.
- Can I join in?
Fuck!
- Maya!
- Fuck!
Maya!
No!
No!
Don' t do this!
It' s already done!
Now, go find his junkie ass.
I' m gonna double back.
I don' t want to hurt you.
Please, come out and let me explain.
Come on, Julian.
We just want to talk.
Julian?
Julian, it doesn' t have to end this way.
How did you think it was going to end, huh?
With all of us living together happily?
Moving to Utah, raising chickens?
No.
It' s gonna be me or you.
Bitch.
Hold this.
Hold it!
We' re never gonna get away with this.
Think happy thoughts, Brit.
- Well, where are we gonna take him?
- Where do you think?
No.
No, not there.
They never found your mom, did they?
Her suicide inspires our perfect murder.
At least she didn' t die in vain.
- Where' s Dr. Haynes?
- He called in sick today.
Oh, really?
So, what would it take to see Niles Dunlap' s body?
A miracle.
Mr. Dunlap' s body was released for cremation this afternoon.
On whose authority?
His daughter, Maya King.
Of course.
Of course.
What' s Dr. Haynes' home address?
Brittney, grab a leg.
We gotta get him in the water.
Come on.
Brittney!
- Shit.
- Come on, let' s go.
- Holy shit!
- Oh, shit.
We are fucked!
- What are we gonna do?
- Calm down, Brittney!
Pull yourself together.
Take care of that thing.
I' il stall him.
Hi.
What in God' s name are you doing out here?
- Don' t you know Gator Alley ain' t safe?
- Yeah.
I was just out here with some friends...... and they kind of ditched me.
So I tried to start my car.
Just making my way back to town.
Town?
Little lady, town is in the opposite direction.
What the hell was that?
I didn' t hear anything.
All right, missy, you get in the back seat of the car.
Come on, get in the back seat of the car.
Now!
Maybe you could just give me a jump.
Fine.
Shit.
Where are you?
That was so fucking close.
It' s done.
Fucking better be.
Meet me at Julian' s.
Shit.
Shit.
Dr. Haynes?
Dr. Haynes?
Bridge, Bridge, Bridge.
This had better be good.
How' d you like a murder case wrapped up nice...... handed to you on a plate?
Murder, huh?
- Who?
- Dr. Julian Haynes.
Yeah?
You okay?
You sure?
You were kind of freaking me out last night.
I' m sure.
Fine.
We' re on for tonight.
Make sure you' re ready.
Yeah, I already checked.
Nothing over here.
How long do you want us to stay out here?
- There ain' t nothing down here.
- Pack it up.
We' re out of here.
Motherfucker.
You got any idea what this bullshit cost the department today, huh?
What about Julian' s body?
They killed him.
He' s in there.
The only thing in that swamp is my fucking reputation.
Maybe the gators pinned him under a log.
- I' m sure if -- - Sure what?
That my boss is gonna have my head because of your bullshit?
You' re done.
I' il make sure of it.
Now, get the fuck out of my county.
You eat well last night?
Well, I hope you had a great fucking meal!
Because it cost me my goddamn job!
This fucking sucks!
It sucks.
The melaleuca sucks everything around it.
Fuck.
Come on, come on.
Shit.
Brit!
- Brittney, come on, we gotta go.
- We can' t go.
- Why not?
- I' m why not.
I need some more ice.
I gotta admit...... it was a cool plan.
I' il give you that.
Using those pesky cellar rats to take Niles' plane down...... making it look like a Cuban hit.
Smart.
But not smart enough.
I called some local exterminators...... and I found out all about Miss Havers' well- documented rat problem.
And then, there' s the little matter...... of digging up Maya' s rotting father...... and getting the coroner to switch the bodies.
You didn' t think about the fresh soil you leave behind...... digging up a body that' s been buried for a full year.
Not sexy.
And last, but not least...... there' s the junkie coroner.
Dear old Julian.
Now, that was a tough one.
What the fuck are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
I' m talking about a beautiful tree...... that does nothing but suck up everything around it...... till nothing' s left.
And those roots, well, they take in anything.
Even blood.
What do you want?
I want half the money.
- Fuck you!
- Bad choice.
Detective Morrison, please.
Yes, I' il hold.
Fine.
Fuck!
Fine!
You' re in, okay?
Half the insurance money.
I want half the score.
Thirty- five million.
Or Morrison will have the easiest murder case ever.
Detective Morrison, Terence Bridge.
How you doing?
All right!
Half.
I just wanted to apologize for this afternoon.
See you on the back nine.
No.
I' m not giving up my half.
Brittney.
Brittney!
Fuck.
I' il take care of her.
So how long you been in the insurance business?
Eleven years.
Eleven years, huh?
Must have been tempting.
Cut a deal, skim a little off the top.
- No, never.
- Never?
Really?
Yeah, well, l find that hard to believe.
It' s not your money.
What made you change your mind?
Eleven years of cutting checks to assholes in wheelchairs...... who later are dancing a fucking jig in Maui.
Paying fortunes out to abused wives whose husbands...... inexplicably decide to take baths with toasters, blow dryers.
Eleven years of living out of a suitcase...... watching the rich get richer.
And a boss who' s just been looking for a reason to fire my ass.
So this is payback time.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that' s right.
For all the years I' ve played by the book.
Now it' s time for old Bridge to get what' s coming to him.
It' s so nice to finally meet somebody who can play my game.
Do it.
Please.
You don' t -- You don' t have to do this.
I' m -- I was --
You just --
- Come on, man.
- You want half the money?
Then you earn it.
Okay.
Where the hell have you been?
- Getting her shit together.
- Well, we could take her to Gator Alley.
No way the police is gonna check that place again.
Just act natural.
Nothing' s wrong.
Nothing' s wrong.
We' re cool.
What the hell are you doing?
Stop me.
I dare you.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Double- crossing fucking --
Yes, there' s a beige Buick LeSabre, license plate 2- 8- 8- A- J- H...... driving around downtown Blue Bay with a dead girl in the trunk.
- Yes, that' s right.
- Morning, Miss Havers.
- ls it ready?
It took a little while to put it all together, but it' il work.
I need to talk to Detective Morrison.
I didn' t kill her, Brittney Havers did.
We can' t find Brittney Havers.
Maybe you killed her too.
You guys are wasting precious time, man.
You need to be at the bus depots, car rentals, the airports.
- We already checked.
She wasn' t there.
- What do you mean she wasn' t there?
Goddamn it.
She doesn' t need to buy a plane ticket because she already knows how to fly.
We are out of here!
She' s probably halfway to the Cayman lslands by now.
- Laughing all the way to the bank.
- Turn to the left.
Oh, boy, she played me like a punk- ass bitch.
That skank.
Turn to the right.
Oh, I' m the fall guy now?
ls that what it is, Brittney?
You just gonna disappear and leave me hanging with all this shit.
Don' t you see what' s going on, man?
She killed all of them.
You know, she killed all of them!
It' s as simple as that!
Nothing is ever as simple as it appears.
lsn' t that what you said, Bridge?
- It is when it' s the truth.
- Sure it is.
Well, the truth is we found this in the trunk of your car.
Right next to the dead girl.
Looks like it came from the Dunlap' s security system.
What do you want?
l want half the money.
Fuck you.
Bad choice.
All right.
I got a little greedy.
- But I didn' t kill Maya, Brittney did.
- Jesus Christ.
She must have erased the rest of the tape or something.
The FBl raided the Dunlap mansion based on testimony...... of a Cuban national arrested in the suspected murder of Niles Dunlap.
Early reports show that records seized indicate Mr. Dunlap misappropriated...... millions of dollars of his company' s funds...... to finance a gambling addiction.
Turning now to entertainment...... concert pianist Benjamin Koskert continues to wow --
He' s not dead.
- He' s not dead.
- Oh, come on.
Niles Dunlap is not fucking dead.
He knew his corporate balls was gonna be in a sling and he set this thing up.
You killed a little girl, you piece of shit!
They' re gonna love you in general population.
Get him out.
You couldn' t find your dick if they put it in your fucking hand!
ln your fucking hand!
You won' t do this, Morrison!
You can' t do this, man!
Don' t do this, please!
Don' t do this!
Jesus, Brit.
What are you trying to do, kill me?
It' s just a little turbulence.
It' il be smooth sailing from here on out.
It sure will.
I' il tell you, greed, it' il do it to you every time.
Poor old Mr. Bridge.
You had him figured out the moment you laid those pretty eyes on him, huh?
- You ready?
- You betcha.
- You got an airboat waiting for us?
- Yeah, it' s all taken care of.
Don' t worry about a thing.
What' s the matter?
You afraid I did something when I packed your chute?
Maybe.
Take mine.
What are you worried about?
You' re dead already.
You know, you and your mother, you couldn' t be more different.
I don' t think she would have ever had the brains...... or the balls to pull off something like this.
- Well, I learned it all from you.
- Bad influence, huh?
The worst.
Here we go!
I' m sorry!
I' m sorry you had to fuck everything in Blue Bay...... and sorry you kept breaking my mother' s heart!
What are you talking about?
I' m sorry I packed your chute with newspaper!
You wouldn' t do that to your own father!
Stepfather!
You should' ve taken the first one I gave you, you fuck!
Hi, Mom.
Let' s go get our money.
I see your 1 0, 000...... and I raise you 20 more.
Oye, man.
Call.
You gotta be fucking kidding me, cabrón.
What' s that make it?
Three, four million you' re in the hole?
How could I have been so fucking stupid?
I have a plan.
It' il get you out of all your troubles.
But you' re gonna have to trust me.
Do you trust me?
- Really think this will work?
- Yeah.
As long as you can get that junkie doctor to cooperate.
Yeah, I' m on it.
- Dr. Haynes.
- Yeah.
Hi.
Can I...
-... ask you a personal question?
- Yeah, sure.
That' s it.
We got him.
Nice to meet you, Pops.
Dickhead.
Come here, Bobby.
You' re gonna need these.
They' re gonna cut down on the glare.
Now, you' re sure you know how to fly this thing, huh?
We' re all set.
The money has been transferred to Zurich.
Well, then, I guess we' il go skiing.
Strong.
They do make them strong here, don' t they?

[Man Screams]
So where are you?
You' re in some motel room.
There' s the key.
It feels like maybe it' s the first time you' ve been there, but... perhaps you' ve been there for a week, three months.
I don' t -- I don' t know.
It' s just an anonymous room.
- This guy.
He' s here already.
Lenny!
It' s Leonard...
Did you?
I must have forgot.
I guess I 've already told you about my condition.
Oh, well, only every time I see you.
- My car.
- This is your car.
Oh, you' re in a playful mood.
- [Car Alarm Chirps]
- Just trying to have a little fun.
- [Radio Newscast, Indistinct]
- Roll up your window.
- Hmm?
It' s broken.
I can get that fixed for you.
So where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.
- You know it?
- Yeah, it' s just this fucked- up building.
- Why Do you wanna go there?
- Don' t remember.
Looks like somebody' s home.
Ah, that thing' s been here for years.
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.
Tracks?
What are you?
Pocahontas?
Come on!
Let' s take a look inside.
"Teddy."
He is the one.
Kill him. "
I finally found him.
How long have I been looking?
Find anything?
Didn' t think so.
Let' s go, huh?
Oh, fuck this.
- You' re gonna pay for what you did.
Beg forgiveness, and then you pay.
You don' t have a clue, you freak.
Beg My wife' s forgiveness before I blow your brains out.
Leonard, you don' t know what' s going on.
- Teddy.
That' s' cause you read it off a fucking picture.
You don' t know who you are.
I' m from San Francisco.
That' s who you were.
That' s not what you' ve become.
- Shut your mouth.
Come on.
Come on, let' s go down to the basement.
Let' s go down, you and me, together.
Then you' il know who you really are.
- [Gunshot]
it' s just an anonymous room.
There' s nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.
[Chuckles, Sighs]
You know, you know who you are, and you know kind of all about yourself.
But just for day- to- day stuff,, notes are really useful.
Sammy Jankis had the same problem, but he really had no system.
He wrote himself a ridiculous amount of notes, but he 'he' d get them all mixed up.
You really do need a system if -- if you' re gonna make it work.
[Bell Buzzes]
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I' m Mr. Shel by from 304.
Burt.
I think I may have asked you to hold my calls.
- You don' t know?
Right.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them.
- Yeah.
- Well, that' s the thing.
I have this condition.
- Condition?
- It' s my memory.
- Amnesia?
It' s different from that.
I know who I am.
I know all about myself.
Since my injury, I can' t make new memories.
Everything fades.
[Laughs]
I don' t even know if I' ve met you before.
So if I seem a little strange or rude or something, uh --
Yeah.
I mean, I don' t mean to mess with you, but it' s so weird.
- No.
- We' ve talked a bunch of times.
- I' m sure we have.
Well, what' s the last thing you remember?
My wife.
What' s it like?
It' s like waking.
It' s like you just woke up.
That must suck.
I mean, it' s all backwards.
Like, may be you get an idea about what you want to do next, but you don' t remember what You just did.
- I' m exactly the opposite -- - How long have I been staying here?
- A couple of days.
- And you' re holding my calls?
- like you said.
- Okay, but this guy' s an exception.
- Do you know this guy?
What makes you think he' s my friend?
- I just saw you together, that' s all.
- He' s not my friend.
- Okay. - if he calls or if he shows up here, you give me a call in my room, okay?
- What, his name' s Teddy?
- Teddy, yeah.
All right.
Look, I hope my condition' s not gonna be a problem for you.
No, not as long as you remember to pay the bill.
- Okay.
- Forty.
This guy --
He' s here already.
Lenny!
You really needa system if you' re gonna make it work.
You kind of learn to trust your own hand writing.
That becomes an important part of your life.
You write your self notes.
And where you put your notes -- That also becomes important.
Particular pockets for particular things.
You just kind of learn to know where things go and how the system works.
You have to be wary of other people writing stuff, for you, that it' s gonna lead you astray.
I mean, I don' t know how these people try and take advantage of somebody with this condition.
If you have a piece of information which is vital, writing on your body instead of on a piece of paper can be the answer.
[Phone Ringing]
Who is this?
"Remember Sam my Jankis."
[Door Opening]
You left these at your table.
Thanks.
Lincoln Street?
Oh, yeah, just go straight out on Sixth Street.
I' m gonna write this down.
- It' s easy. Just go -- - Trust me.
I need to write this down.
"The Discount Inn."
Discount Inn.
Natalie.
My car.
Teddy.
"John Edward Gammell."
This guy told me his name was Teddy.
"Don' t believe his lies."
[Dialing]
[Line Ringing]
- [Man On Phone]
Lenny, is that you?
- John Gammell?
- Lenny, it' s Teddy.
Stay there.
- I' il be right over.
I' il be waiting.
Male "
"First name John."
"Last name 'G' for Gammell."
"Drugs.
License plate. "
"SG1 3... 7I U."
It' s him.
I found you, you fuck.
I don' t remember that.
Yeah, but it' s not amnesia.
I just can' t make new memories.
So I can' t remember talking to you.
Oh, Sammy Jankis.
I tell people about Sammy to help them understand.
Sammy' s story helps me understand my own situation.
Well, Sammy wrote himself endless amounts of notes, but he got mixed up.
I have a more graceful solution to the memory problem.
I' m disciplined and organized.
I use habit and routine to make my life possible.
Sammy had no drive, no reason to make it work.
Me?
Yeah, I got a reason.
[Car Alarm Chirps]
[Thinking]
Meet Natalie for info.
"She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity. "
- Natalie?
- You don' t remember me.
I should have explained.
I have this -- - You did explain, Lenny.
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.
You told me.
- Then I probably told you how much I hated it.
Yeah.
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
Thanks.
So you have information for me?
- Yeah.
Must be tough living your life according to a couple of scraps of paper.
Mix your laundry list with your grocery list, and you' il end up eating your underwear.
I guess that' s why you have those freaky tattoos.
Yeah, it' s tough.
It' s almost impossible.
Look, I' m sorry I don' t remember you.
It' s nothing personal.
I do have information for you.
You gave me a license plate number.
Had my friend at D. M. V. trace it.
Guess what name came up.
John Edward Gammell. John G.
- Do you know him?
But his face on his driver' s license looked really familiar.
I think he' s been in the bar, maybe.
Here' s a copy of his license, his registration, photo and all. are you sure you want this?
- Yeah.
- Then you shouldn' t have to ask.
But even If you get revenge, you' re not gonna remember it.
You' re not even gonna know that it happened.
My wife deserves vengeance.
Doesn' t make any difference whether I know about it.
Just because there are things I don' t remember doesn' t make my actions meaningless.
The world doesn' t just disappear when you close your eyes, does it?
Anyway, maybe I' il take a photograph to remind myself, get another freaky tattoo.
Tell me about her again.
Why?
Because you like to remember her.
She was beautiful.
No.
Don' t just recite the words.
Close your eyes... and remember her.
You can just feel the details.
The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words.
And you can feel these extreme moments... even If you don' t want to.
You put these together, and you get the feel ofa person.
Enough to know how much you miss them...
and how much you hate the person who took them away.
I, um -- I added an address in here.
It might be useful.
It' s an abandoned place outside of town.
A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.
It' s isolated.
Sounds perfect.
Do I owe you any --
I wasn' t helping you for money.
- I' m sorry.
- It' s okay.
"See, you have this condition."
Oh, are you still staying at the Discount Inn, room 304?
You left it at my place.
Yeah.
- They treating you okay?
- I don' t remember.
You know what we have in common?
We are both survivors.
You take care, Leonard.
"Remember Sammy Jankis."
Insurance.
I was an investigator.
I' d investigate the claims to see which ones were phony.
I had to see through people' s bullshit.
It was useful experience, 'cause now it' s my life.
When I meet someone, I don' t know if I' ve met them before.
I have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out.
My job taught me the best way to find out what someone knew was just to let them talk... and watch the eyes and the body language.
If someone scratches their nose while they' re talking, experts tell you it means they' re lying.
It really means they' re nervous.
People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.
It' s all about context.
Yeah, I was good.
Sam my was my first rst real challenge lenge.
[Engine Starts]
I thought you split for good.
- Well I, things change.
- So I see.
- My name' s Teddy.
- I guess I' ve told you about my condition.
Only every time I see you.
Come on, I' il buy you lunch.
- Mm.
Yeah.
I' m sick of hearing about the guy.
What about John G.?
- Who?
- Johnny G., the guy you' re looking for.
- Maybe.
- Leonard, look, you have to be very careful.
- Why?
The other day you mentioned that maybe somebody... was trying to set you up, get you to kill the wrong guy.
Well, I go on facts, not recommendations, but thank you.
Lenny, you can' t trust a man' s life to your little notes and pictures.
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.
- Memory' s unreliable.
- Oh, please!
No, really.
It' s not even that good.
Ask the police.
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.
- Cops don' t catch a killer by remembering stuff.
They collect facts, they make notes, and they draw conclusions.
Facts, not memories.
That' s how you investigate.
It' s what I used to do.
It can change the color of a car.
And memories can be distorted.
They' re not a record.
They' re irrelevant If you have the facts.
You really want to get this guy, don' t you?
He killed My wife.
He took away my fucking memory.
He destroyed my ability to live.
- You' re living.
- Only for revenge.
Well, then we' il get the bastard.
Where are you staying?
The Discount Inn.
I don' t know what room.
I haven' t got my key.
Probably left in your room.
[Bell Ringing]
I' m checked in here, but I think I' ve misplaced my key.
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?
I don' t see my key anywhere.
This is the wrong room.
You' re in 304 now.
I fucked up.
- No.
Come on, let' s go.
- Why is this my hand writing?
Well... this was your room, but now you' re in 304.
- When was I in here?
- Last week.
- Why?
Business is slow.
I mean, I told my boss about the -- your condition and stuff,, and he said try and rent him another room.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this shit- hole?
J Just two, so far.
Well, at least you' re being honest about ripping me off.
Well, you' re not gonna remember anyway.
You don' t have to be that honest, Burt.
Leonard, always get a receipt.
Oh, yeah.
I' m gonna write that down.
- Hey, what time is it?
- Quarter to one.
Excuse me.
Your room' s --
- Natalie?
- You don' t remember me.
I' d just become an investigator when I came across Sammy.
Strangest case ever.
Now, the guy' s a 58- year- old semiretired accountant.
Nothing too serious.
He can' t get a handle on what' s going on.
The doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus.
Nothing conclusive, but Sammy can 't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes.
Can 't work, can' t do shit.
His wife calls the insurance company, and I get sent in.
Now, this is my first big claims investigation, so I really check into it.
- Sammy can think just fine, but he can' t make any new memories.
- He can only remember things for a couple of minutes.
He liked commercials.
- Sammy.
It' s time for my shot.
The crazy part was that this guy... who couldn' t even follow the plot of Green Acres anymore... could do the most complicated things... as long as he learned them before the accident... and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.
- Now, the doctors assure me... there' s a real condition called anterial- grade memory loss, or short- term memory loss.
It' s rare, but legit.
I catch this look, this slight look of recognition.
But he says he can 't remember me at all.
I got it.
I got it.
- H i, Mrs. J ankis.
- Now, I can read people, and I' m thinking: bad actor.
So now I 'm suspicious, and I order more tests.
[Thinking]
Oh, where am I?
Somebody' s bedroom.
Ah, it must be her room.
But who is she?
It' s only me.
- Yeah.
You?
Yeah.
Shit!
I got to be some place.
- It' s pretty weird.
- It' s useful.
You never write a phone number on your hand?
I, um -- I should be able to talk to my friend today about the license plate.
- Yeah, the license plate.
- John G. 's license plate.
You have it tattooed on your thigh.
"Natalie."
"She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity. "
Mm, if It' s registered in this state, it should only take a couple of seconds to pull up his license and registration.
I' il call you as soon as I talk to him.
Do you thi nk we could just arrange a meeting now?
You know, it' s great that you -- well, that you' re helping me like this.
I' m helping you because you helped me.
So next time you see me, will you remember me?
I think you will.
I' m sorry.
Lenny, before you go, could I have my shirt back, please?
[Engine Starts]
I thought you split for good.
Sammy couldn' t pick up any new skills at all.
But I find something in my research: conditioning.
Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition.
It' s how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You just get better through practice.
It' s a completely different part of the brain from the short- term memory.
So I had the doctors test Sammy' s response to conditioning.
- Just pick up any three objects.
- That' s a test?
Hey, where were you guys when I did my C. P. A.?
Sorry.
Ta- da!
- Ow!
What the fuck?
- It' s a test, Sammy.
- Well, test this, you fucking quack.
Some of the objects were electrify Ied.
They' d give him a small shock.
They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrify Ied.
The poi nt was to see if Sam my could learn to avoid the electrify Ied objects... not by memory, but by instinct.
[Car Alarm Chirps]
[Knocking]
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?
Guess I don' t have to worry about him anymore.
- What the fuck have you got me into?
- Shh.
- Who is he?
Okay?
This is my problem.
It has nothing to do with your investigation.
- How did you get me into this?
- You offered to help when you saw what he did to my face.
- How do I know he did that?
- Because I came straight to you after he did it.
- I showed you what he did, and I asked you to help me.
- Yeah.
- Something doesn' t feel right.
I think someone' s fucking with me, trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
- Did you?
Kill him?
Of course not!
Hey, what -- Sit down, okay?
Sit.
This has nothing to do with you.
You helped me out, and I' m grateful.
Leonard, you decided to help me. trust yourself. trust your own judgment.
- You can never know anything for sure.
- There are things you know for sure.
Such as?
[Knocks On Wood]
See?
Certainties.
It' s the kind of memory you take for granted.
You know, I can remember so much.
The feel of the world... and her.
She' s gone.
And the present is trivia, which I scribble down as fucking notes!
Come on.
It' s not easy for me to relax, you know?
Shh.
Come on.
Take your jacket off.
Come on.
Here.
Didn' t think you were the type.
It' s backwards.
Come here!
What about here?
Maybe it' s for when I find him.
I' ve lost somebody too.
I' m sorry.
His name was Jimmy. what happened to him?
He never came back.
Who did he go to meet?
A guy called Teddy.
What do the police think?
They don' t look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
When you find this guy, this John G., what are you gonna do?
I' m gonna kill him.
Maybe I can help you find him.
I don' t even know how long she' s been gone.
It' s like I' ve woken up in bed and she' s not here... because she' s gone to the bathroom or something.
I just know she' s never gonna come back to bed.
I would know that it was cold.
But I can' t.
I know I can' t have her back.
But I don' t want to wake up in the morning thinking she' s still here.
I lie here not knowing how long I' ve been alone.
So how --
How can I heal?
How am I supposed to heal if I can' t... feel time?
"She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity. "
They kept testing Sammy for months, always with the same objects carrying an electrical charge.
- [Object Buzzes]
What the fuck?
- It' s a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you quack!
Sammy should have learned to instinctively stop picking up the wrong objects.
Sammy didn 't respond at all.
It was enough to suggest that his condition was psychological, not physical.
We turned down his clai m on the grounds that he wasn' t covered for mental illness.
His wife got stuck with the bills, and I got a big promotion.
Conditioning didn' t work for Sammy, so he became helpless.
But it works for me.
I live the way Sammy couldn' t.
Habit and routine make my life possible.
Conditioning.
Acting on instinct.
[Indistinct Screeching]
[Man Shouts]
- [Car Horn Honks]
Where am I?
Motel room.
[Groans]
Some anonymous motel room.
Nothing in the drawers, but I' il take a look anyway.
Nothing except the Gideon Bi -- Bible.
[knocking At Door]
- Just a minute.
- Open the door.
Lenny!
Open the door!
Come on!
Hi, Teddy.
- [Door Closes]
[Sighs]
Oh, I get it.
Amorous neighbors.
- What are you doing here?
You called me.
You said you needed my help.
You know, I' ve had more rewarding friendships than this one.
Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes.
- [Muffled Crying Continues]
- You don' t know him?
No!
Should I?
Wait a minute.
- Is that John G.?
- I don' t think so.
- You don' t think so?
You didn' t write it down?
- I might' ve fallen asleep.
For Christ' s sakes!
Ask him.
Your name!
- Dodd.
- And who did this to you?
- What?
- Who did this to you?
You did.
Look, I' m not gonna help you kill that guy.
No, just let me think for a minute.
[Muffled Crying Continues]
- Okay, Natalie. - who' s Natalie?
- Natalie who?
Maybe I know her.
Look, we gotta get him out of here.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
He' s gotta have a car, right?
So we take him down to his car, we tell him to get out of town or we' re gonna kill him.
We can' t just walk him out of here tied up and bleeding.
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don' t know!
You don' t know.
Yes, I do.
This is not my room.
- It must be his room.
Let' s go.
- No, no, no.
- We can' t just leave him here.
The maid' s gonna walk in.
She' il see him, call the cops.
He can I. D. us.
Okay.
We untie him, we clean him up... and we march him out of here with a gun in his back.
A gun.
Why would I have a gun?
- It must be his.
- I don' t think they' d let someone like me carry a gun.
Fucking hope not.
Which one?
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.
- Shut up.
You' re the one with the Jag.
All right, get in.
You follow us.
Give me your keys.
Take your own car.
- Yeah.
I think it was your sinister moustache.
Fuck you.
You should have stolen his car.
- Nothing.
You want to trade?
[Sighs]
So what Do you do now?
I' m going to find out what the fuck that was all about.
[Knocking]
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?
Sammy' s wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him... and fighting the company' s decision.
But it wasn' t the money that got to her.
I have an idea.
Sammy, I have an idea I want you to do for me.
Just that his problem was mental, not physical.
I want you to have a pen in your pocket, okay?
- You' re gonna have a pen in your pocket.
- I did something wrong.
- You did something wrong!
We' re gonna deal with it.
- We' re gonna try harder -- - when she looks into his eyes and sees the same person.
- You can' t go anywhere! - if It' s not a physical problem, he should just snap out ofit.
- Ellen called!
[Crying]
- Ellen called?
- Ellen can' t come today!
I 'm sorry!
- I 'm sorry.
I 'm trying.
I 'm sorry.
- Try harder!
So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt... just like he gave it to the doctors.
But I never said that he was faking.
I never said that.
[Thinking]
Hmm, I don' t feel drunk.
[Door Closes]
[Toilet Flushing]
- [woman knocking]
Hello?
Housekeeping.
- Not right now.
- Oh, I' m sorry.
"Dodd.
Put him onto Teddy... or just get rid of him for Natalie. "
Dodd.
Get rid of him.
Ask Natalie.
Teddy, Teddy.
[Dial Tone]
[Line Ringing]
Yeah, leave your number.
This is a message for Teddy.
I' m at the Mount crest Inn of Fifth Street, room six.
I need you to come over as soon as you get this.
It' s important.
Oh, this is Leonard.
Thanks.
Fuck.
Mrs. Jankis didn' t understand that you can' t bully someone into remembering.
The more pressure you' re under, the harder it gets.
Uh, well, then call me -- call me back?
[Car Alarm Blaring]
[Thinking]
Okay, so what am I doing?
Oh, I' m chasing this guy.
No.
He' s chasing me.
[Alarm Continues Blaring]
[Alarm Chirps, Stops]
[Groaning]
Fuck.
White guy.
I' il get the jump on you, you fucker.
- Oh, fuck.
- Sorry.
I need a weapon.
This will do.
Hmm, I don' t feel drunk.
[Car Alarm Chirps]
[Thinking]
Do I know this guy?
- He seems to know me.
What the fuck?
- Thank you.
- Where' d you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?
What, I haven' t made a strong enough impression on you?
I wouldn' t be too hard on yourself.
[Thinking]
Okay, so what am I doing?
- [Phone Ringing]
- Who is this?
[Car Alarm Chirps]
[Car Alarm Chirps]
Ouch.
Cut it out.
- How can you read that again?
- It' s good.
Yeah, but you' ve read it, like, a thousand times.
I enjoy it.
- was in wanting to know what happens next.
- Look, don' t be a prick.
I' m not reading it to annoy you.
J Just let me read, please.
Probably tried this before.
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.
Can' t remember to forget you.
Uh- huh.
Well, sir, that' d certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries.
I was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle.
Hang on a sec?
Now, the police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house.
Bloody prints were all over it.
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy ofit.
I dealt with the police a lot in my insurance job.
With my condition, it' s really tough.
I can' t keep it all in mind at once.
I have to summarize the diff, erentsections.
And there' s pages missing.
I guess I' ve been trying to log them all.
I don' t know why these are crossed out.
But they weren' t even looking for John G.
The stuff they found in the car just fit in with what they believed had happened, so they didn' t chase any ofit up.
[Door Squeaks, Shuts]
Honey.
Honey, it' s late.
Everything okay?
- You okay in there?
What?
Was I supposed to lock the door?
No.
I' d like you to leave now.
[Car Alarm Chirps]
There' s something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn' t ring true for me.
Because the police claim the guy was an addict, needing money to score, which I think is bullshit,
'cause he' s not gonna go breaking into places while he' s still got a stash that big.
Well, I think John G. left it there or planted it there.
How Do you know that?
Oh, shit, that' s true.
It fits.
So he' s a dealer.
Hang on a sec.
Now we' re getting somewhere.
"Discount Inn."
[Alarm Chirps]
Yeah, okay.
Blonde' s fine.
Well, that' s what they say.
304.
Leonard.
Well, what then?
You wait for me to fall asleep.
You go into the bathroom and you slam the door.
- Yeah.
Loud enough to wake me up.
- And that' s it?
- That' s it.
Uh, yeah, first I just need you to put these things around the room.
Just pretend they' re your things and that this is your bedroom.
- No, no, no.
Uh, just like you took it off or something.
I' m sorry.
Just -- I just mean put them around the room, you know, as if they were your -- your things.
Whatever gets you off.
[Door Squeaks, Shuts]
I can' t blame the cops for not taking me seriously.
This is difficult to understand.
I mean, look at Sammy Jankis.
His own wife couldn' t deal with it.
I told you about how she tried to get him to snap out ofit.
Eventually she came to see me at the office.
I found out all kinds of shit.
- She told me about life with Sammy, how she treated him.
- Thank you for seeing me.
It got to the point where she' d get Sammy to hide food all around the house... and then she' d stop feeding him just to see if his hunger... would make him remember where he' d hidden the food.
She just wanted old Sammy back.
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you' ve decided that he' s faking.
It' s just that his condition can' t be shown to be --
I just wanna know what your honest opinion about Sammy is.
We shouldn' t even be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal.
- I' m not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?
Try to understand. when I look at Sammy,
I don' t see some... vegetable.
I see my same old Sammy.
What do you think that' s like for me... to suspect that he might be imagining this whole problem?
And that if Just could say the right thing, he' d snap out of it and go back to being normal.
If I --
If I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone, then I could say good- bye and start loving this new Sammy.
As long as I have doubt, I can' t say good- bye and move on.
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to forget the company you work for 30 seconds... and tell me If you really believe that Sammy' s faking his condition.
I need to know... what you honestly believe.
I bel ieve that Sam my should be physically capable of making new memories.
Thank you.
I thought I helped her.
I thought she just needed some kind of answer.
I didn' t think it was important what the answer was, just that she had one to believe.
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?
- Teddy, your buddy.
Sammy.
Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!
- Jeez!
- What the fuck are you doing in my car?
What, your sense of humor went with the memory?
- Do you even know why you' re here?
- Unfinished business.
Your business here is very much finished.
- You' re still here because of Natalie.
- Who' s Natalie?
Schmuck, whose house do you think you just walked out of?
Take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz.
You can' t trust her.
Oh, yeah?
Why' s that?
Because by now she' s taken a look at this suit and the car... and she' s starting to figure out ways of turning the situation to her advantage.
She' s already got you staying with her, for Christ' s sakes.
You can' t go back in there.
Let me give you the name ofa motel.
- You' re lucky I ran into you.
That broad' s bad news.
She' s involved with drugs.
All right, look.
These.
You see these?
This is the bar where she works.
Her boyfriend' s a drug dealer.
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.
Then she slips him the answers when she serves him his drinks.
- Why should I care?
- she' s gonna use you to protect herself.
- From who?
Guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.
Guys are gonna come after her.
Somebody always pays.
Maybe she' il make it you.
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe she' il make it you.
Is that it?
You worried that she' s gonna use me against you?
- No. - why not?
Because she doesn' t know who I am.
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.
She doesn' t know anything about your investigation, okay, Einstein?
So write this down.
When she offers to help, it' il be for her own reasons.
I' m not lying.
Write this down.
Do not trust her.
- There.
You happy now?
- I won' t be happy until you leave town. why not?
You ever wonder how long you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
- What sort of questions?
- Like what?
- I have money.
- From what?
My wife' s death.
I used to work in insurance.
We were well covered.
Oh!
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership.
You don' t have a clue, Do you?
- You don' t even know who you are.
I don' t have amnesia.
I remember everything right up until the incident.
I am from San Francisco --
That' s who you were.
You do not know who you are, what you' ve become since... the incident.
You wander around playing detective.
You don' t even know how long ago it was.
Let me put it this way.
Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?
- Right.
You' re an investigator.
- Well, maybe you should start investigating yourself.
- Thank you for the advice.
Don' t go back in there.
Will you take the motel out of town?
It' s been fun, Lenny.
"Do not trust her."
"Don' t believe his lies."
I need my own place.
[keys Jangling, Engine Starts]
She shouldn' t have given me that responsibility.
I' m a claims investigator, not a doctor.
I guess.
But I' ve got all sorts of other considerations.
Legal responsibility, large financ --
- [Receiver Clicks, Dial Tone]
Write down what happened.
Write it down.
Write it down.
Concentrate.
Keep it in mind.
Find a pen --
- What happened?
He beat the shit out of me.
- Who?
- Who?
Dodd.
- Why?
- Why?
Because of you.
- Because I did what you told me to do!
- Calm down.
- Tell him about Teddy!
- Great fucking idea!
Take it easy.
You' re safe.
Come on. Just sit down.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Okay.
You' re okay.
I' il just get some ice for your face.
Here.
I did exactly what you told me to do.
I went to Dodd... and I told him that I -- I didn' t have any of Jimmy' s money... or the drugs, and that this Teddy must have taken everything.
And what did he say?
He didn' t believe me.
He said if I don' t have the drugs by tomorrow, he' s gonna kill me.
And then he just -- he just started hitting me.
Where is he?
- Why?
- And?
- I' il give him some bruises of his own... and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
Ah, he' il kill you, Lenny.
Yeah?
I hated it.
Oh, this guy -- this guy is so dangerous.
- Let' s just think of something else, okay?
You just tell me what he looks like... and where I can find him.
- Have you got a pen?
- In my purse.
He' il, um -- He' il probably find you.
- What do you mean?
- I told him about your car.
Why?
I had to tell him something.
Just write it all down.
Be careful.
I' il be fine.
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?
[Ringing]
[Ringing Continues]
Front desk?
Right.
This is Mr. Shelby in room 21.
Yeah, that' s it.
I don' t want any calls.
None at all.
- Somebody' s come already. - who?
- He calls himself Dodd.
- What does he want?
- He thinks I have it.
He thinks I took it.
Well, did you?
No.
- What' s this all about?
You don' t have a fucking clue, Do you?
You' re just blissfully ignorant.
- Look, I have this condition.
- Yeah, I know all about your fucking condition, Leonard!
Probably know more about it than you do.
You don' t have a clue about anything else.
- What happened?
- Jimmy went to meet some guy named Teddy.
He took a lot of money with him, and he never came back.
Jimmy' s partners think I set him up.
I don' t even know If you know this, Teddy,
- Neither do I.
- Don' t protect him!
Help me.
- I' m not.
- Get rid of Dodd for me.
Kill him.
I' il pay you.
- What?
What Do you think I am?
I' m not gonna kill someone for money.
Love?
What would you kill for?
- You' d kill for your wife, wouldn' t you?
- Not to me.
I wasn' t fucking married to her.
- Hey, don' t talk about My wife.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!
I can say whatever I want and you won' t remember.
I could call your wife a fucking whore.
- Calm down.
- Easy for you to say.
- Take it easy.
- Maybe it does.
How the fuck would you know?
You don' t know a fucking thing!
- Yes.
Ah, you pathetic piece of shit.
- Shut your mouth.
- You know what?
I' m gonna use you.
I' m telling you now, because I' m gonna enjoy it so much more... if I know that you could stop me If you weren' t such a fucking freak.
Did you lose your pen?
Well, that' s too bad, freak.
Otherwise, you could write yourself a little note... about how much Natalie hates your retarded guts and that I called your wife a whore.
- Don' t say another fuckin 'word.
- About your whore of a wife?
I read about your condition, Leonard.
You know what one of the causes of short- term memory loss is? venereal disease.
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife sucked one too many diseased cocks... and turned you into a fucking retard!
You sad, sad... freak.
I can say whatever the fuck I want... and you won' t remember.
We' il still be best friends... or maybe even lovers.
Fuck.
I' il see you soon.
Stay focused.
Find a pen.
Gotta write this down.
Gotta write it down.
Concentrate.
Keep it in mind.
Come on.
Find a pen.
I have to find a pen.
Write this down, exactly what happened.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Find a pen. Jeez!
Okay, focus.
Keep focused.
Come on.
Write this note.
Write down what happened.
Write it down.
Concentrate.
Keep it in mind.
Find a pen.
- What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.
- Who?
- Who?
Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.
Hello?
- It' s Burt, from the front desk.
- Uh, I know you said you didn' t want any calls.
He says he' s a cop.
- Yeah.
And, uh, he says you' re really gonna wanna know what he has to say, so --
I' m not too good on the phone.
I need to look people in the eye when I talk to them.
Well, what --
You can, um -- You can crash on the couch.
It' s comfortable.
Just have a seat.
Thanks.
- So how long Do you think it' s gonna take you?
- Hmm?
You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife?
Oh, well, that depends on if he' s here in town or if he' s moved on.
I have my file here.
Can I ask you something?
If you have all of that information, then why haven' t the police found him for you?
- Well, they' re not looking for him.
- Why not?
They don' t think he exists.
I was asleep.
- Something woke me up.
Her side of the bed was cold.
She' d obviously been out of bed for awhile.
[Muffled Cries]
There had to be a second man.
I remember.
It' s about the last thing that I do remember.
If we check the police --
How do they explain what you do remember?
The gun and stuff,.
John G. was clever.
He was clever.
See, he took the dead man' s gun and replaced it with the sap that he hit me with.
He left my gun and he left the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.
The found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man' s hand.
And they only found my gun.
They didn' t need to look for anybody else.
I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.
See, the cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition.
Leonard, you can stay here for a couple of days if It' il help you.
Well, thanks.
I have to go back to work.
So, um, just make yourself at home.
You can watch Tv or you can have some food, whatever you want, okay?
- Make yourself at home.
- One thing.
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.
"Natalie."
[Door Opens]
- what' s wrong?
[Phone Ringing]
[Ringing Continues]
[Ringing]
- On the house.
- Thanks.
[Laughing]
My, you really do have a problem.
- J Just like that cop said.
- Your condition.
- Well, nobody' s perfect.
What' s the last thing that you do remember?
- That' s sweet.
Dying.
I remember My wife dying.
Let me, um, get you another one.
I think this one' s dusty.
Why are you calling me?
What Do you want?
I know you' re a cop, but what Do you want?
Have I done something wrong?
I don' t know.
Something bad, maybe.
Why are you asking me?
I can' t remember what I' ve done.
You wouldn' t believe me anyway.
Because of my condition.
You don' t believe someone with this condition.
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn' t even fucking believe Sammy!
"Ferdy' s Bar."
"Come by after.
Natalie. "
I' il have a beer, please.
- What Do you want?
- A beer, please.
You can' t just waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer.
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?
- I' m meeting someone called Natalie.
- Well, that' s me.
We met before, right?
- Then why am I here?
- I don' t know.
Tell me.
I have no short- term memory.
It' s not amnesia.
- Oh, you' re the memory guy.
- How Do you know about me?
- Yeah?
Who' s your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants.
Do you know him?
No.
Well, he knows you.
He told me about you.
He said you were staying at the Discount.
In fact, a cop came by here earlier looking for you.
Said he was looking for a guy who can' t remember anything, wouldn' t know how he got here... or what he' d done.
Said I get a lot of guys around here like that.
Well, you know, chronic alcoholism is one cause of short- term memory loss.
- are you Teddy?
My name is Leonard.
- Did Teddy send you?
- I don' t know.
- What' s happened to Jimmy?
- Sorry.
- You don' t remember anything?
No.
I can' t make new memories.
Everything just fades.
- I found this in my pocket.
Your pocket.
[Clearing Throat]
Bar bet.
Care to contribute?
- No, thanks.
- It' s for a lot of money.
Come on.
Help me out.
[Hawking]
Thank you.
- Thanks.
[Man Laughing]
It' s completely fucked because nobody believes you.
It' s amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility.
I guess it' s some kind of poetic justice for not believing Sammy.
You know the truth about my condition, officer?
You don' t know anything.
You feel angry, you don' t know why.
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.
You could do anything and not have the faintest idea ten minutes later.
Like Sammy.
I could have done something like Sammy.
I didn' t tell you -- what happened to Sammy and his wife?
Well, she came to see me at my office.
I thought she was just trying to catch me off, guard, so I didn' t tell her what I really thought, but I never said that he was faking, just that his condition was mental, not physical.
I found out later that she went home and gave Sammy his final exam.
Sammy?
It' s time for my shot.
So she found a way to test him.
Sam my.
I t' s ti me for my shot.
H m m.
- There you go.
Or she just didn' t wanna live with the things she put him through.
Sammy.
I t' s time for my shot.
I t won' t hurt.
She went into a coma and never recovered.
- Sammy couldn' t understand or explain what happened.
- Oh!
He' s been in a home ever since.
He doesn' t even know that his wife' s dead.
I was wrong about Sammy, and I was wrong about his wife.
She wasn' t interested in the money.
She just needed to understand his problem.
But he wasn' t a con man.
And when she looked into his eyes, she thought he could be the same person. when I looked into his eyes, I thought I saw recognition.
You fake it.
I f you' re supposed to recognize somebody, you just pretend to.
You bluff, it to get a pat on the head from the doctors.
You bluff, it to seem less ofa freak.
[Tires Screeching]
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It' s okay.
We know each other.
Right, kid?
- How did you know I was here?
You should have put it around back. what are you still doing here?
There' s plenty of tattoo parlors up north.
I just wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind.
- It' il be all right for a minute.
- Wait out there.
- Oh, for Christ --
I gotta get something for you.
Car license SG137IU.
Wait a minute, will ya?
- All right, we gotta get you out of here.
- Why?
Aw, man.
Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?
- It' s not safe for you to hang around here anymore.
- Why not?
Because that cop' s looking for you.
A different car would do for now.
So put these on.
Whoa, whoa.
What cop?
He' s the one who checked you into the Discount Inn.
- How Do you know this?
- He told me.
He thinks it' s funny.
- You' re full of shit.
I' m not.
He knows you' re no good on the phone, so he' s been calling you up.
Sometimes you don' t answer the phone, so he slips shit under your door to scare you into answering the phone again, giving you a line of crap about John G. being some local drug dealer.
- Who' s Jimmy Grants?
Leonard, Jimmy' s the drug dealer.
He' s got some score in mind.
Uh- huh.
How Do you know him?
He' s a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together. if he knew I was helping you, he' d fucking kill me.
So take these clothes, put them on and get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Leonard.
You are full of shit.
Natalie. "
"Ferdy' s Bar."
- [Knocking On Window]
- Hey, Jimmy.
I, uh, thought you were somebody else.
Sorry.
That' s okay.
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works?
But he' s not gonna bring her along.
He' il come by himself, right?
I always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him.
I' m as ready as I' il ever be.
You' re in the lobby?
What Do you look like?
I' il be right there.
Lenny.
Officer Gammell.
Yeah.
Come on.
- Hey, smile.
- Oh, don' t -- Not here.
Over here.
- Now, is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?
- You know what?
Don' t write Gammell, just Teddy.
- Why?
- I' m undercover.
This is the directions where he' s going.
- My number' s on the bottom If you need me.
No.
It wouldn' t be appropriate.
Nice picture.
I look thin.
Hey, Lenny.
Make him beg.
Teddy!
Hey, Teddy!
Teddy!
Jimmy.
- You J immy Grants?
- Expecting any otherJ immys out here, Memory Man?
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you. where the fuck' s Teddy? well?
Mother fuck -- What the fuck are you doing?
- Strip.
- You' re making a big fucking mistake, pal.
Strip!
- My associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off.
- Don' t say anything else.
- I knew I couldn' t trust that fuck!
- Take it off.
- Your pants too.
- Why?
I don' t wanna get blood on them.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did he tell you what I was bringing?
- Take your fuckin 'pants off!.
- I' ve got two hundred grand stashed in the car!
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?
- Just take the money and walk away!
- I don' t want your money!
Then what? - what Do you want from me?
Sammy.
He said "Sammy."
How does he know about Sammy?
Oh, fuck.
What have I done?
Hey, mister, I need help.
There' s a guy in here, he' s hurt bad.
- We gotta get him to a doctor.
- All right.
I don' t know what happened.
- I' ve got this memory thing.
Don' t worry.
I' m a cop.
- Is he still breathing?
Maybe.
What the hell were you guys doing down here?
Well, I don' t remember.
I have this condition. well, I hope it' s not as serious as his, 'cause this guy' s dead.
Ouch!
That shit kills!
- So you remember me now, huh?
- You are a fuckin 'cop.
And I 'm the guy that helped you find him.
Get up.
Get up.
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.
Who is that?
Of course he did.
Bullshit.
He' s not the guy.
His name is James F. Grants.
John G. Check your tattoos.
- What was he bringing the two hundred grand for?
- A load of amphetamines I told him I had.
- No.
Yeah, that and your thing.
Look, Leonard, Jimmy' s your guy.
- I just figured we' d make a few dollars on the side.
The Discount Inn.
He dealt out of there.
The guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came snooping around.
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture of the dump.
- No!
You get half!.
Why would I tell him about fuckin 'Sammy?
You tell everybody about Sammy, everybody who' il listen.
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
Great story.
It gets better every time you tell it.
So you lie to yourself to be happy.
There' s nothing wrong with that.
We all do it.
Who cares if there' s a few little details you' d rather not remember?
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don' t know.
Your wife' s surviving the assault.
Her not believing your condition.
The torment and pain and anguish... tearing her up inside.
The insulin.
That' s Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.
Yeah, right. like you tell yourself over and over again.
- Learning through repetition.
- Sammy let his wife kill herself.
- Sammy ended up in an institution.
- Sammy was a con man, a faker.
I never said that Sammy was faking.
You exposed him for what he was -- a fraud.
But I was wrong.
That' s the whole point.
- See, Sammy' s wife came to me.
- Sammy didn' t have a wife.
It was your wife who had diabetes.
Ouch.
My wife wasn' t diabetic.
You sure?
- Ouch.
Cut it out.
- She wasn' t diabetic.
You think I don' t know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Well, I guess I can only make you remember the things you wanna be true.
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He' s not the right guy.
Come on.
You got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember. what diff, erence does it make whether he was your guy or not?
- Why?
You' re never gonna know.
I will.
- No, you won' t.
- Somehow I' il know.
- You won' t remember!
It' il be different.
In fact, I was sure ofit, but you didn' t!
That' s right.
I helped you find him over a year ago.
He' s already dead.
- Don' t lie to me anymore.
- Look, Lenny.
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.
I' m the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night, the guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife.
You killed him.
But you didn' t remember.
looking for the guy you already killed.
So who was he?
Just some guy.
I mean, does it even matter who?
No reason, Lenny.
No conspiracy.
Just bad fucking luck.
Couple of junkies too strung out to realize your wife didn' t live alone.
But when you killed him, I was so convinced that you' d remember.
But it didn' t stick.
Like nothing ever sticks.
Like this won' t stick.
I took that picture... just when you did it.
Look how happy you are.
I wanted to see that face again.
- Fuck you.
I gave you a reason to live, and you were more than happy to help.
You make up your own truth.
Like your police file.
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the 1 2 pages?
- No, it wasn' t me.
See, it was you.
- Why would I do that?
- To create a puzzle you could never solve.
How many John G' s or James G' s?
I mean, shit, Lenny, I' m a fucking John G.
- Your name is Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.
My name' s John Edward Gammell.
There' s plenty of John G' s for us to find.
All you do is moan.
I' m the one that has to live with what you' ve done.
I' m the one that put it all together.
You, you wander around, you' re playing detective.
You live in a dream, kid.
A romantic quest that you wouldn' t end even if I wasn' t in the picture.
- Quit it.
Lenny, come on.
You' re not a killer.
That' s why you' re so good at it.
What are you doing?
You know what time it is?
I' m buying.
Fuck.
[Thinking]
I' m just someone who wanted to make things right.
Can I just let myself forget what you' ve told me?
Can I just let myself forget what you made me do?
You think I just want another puzzle to solve?
Another John G. to look for?
You' re a John G.
So you can be my John G.
Do I lie to myself to be happy?
In your case, Teddy, yes, I will.
Hey, that' s not your car!
- It is now.
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!
Somebody' il recognize it!
You know, I think I' d rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.
I might hang on to this for a while.
- Lenny.
Look, don' t -- - Will you help me find the keys?
Help me find my keys.
Lenny!
I have to believe in a world outside my own mind.
I have to believe that my actions still have meaning, even if I can' t remember them.
I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world' s still here.
Do I believe the world' s still here?
Is it still out there?
Yeah.
We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are.
I' m no different.
Now, where was I?
??? we layin each other' s arms?
(gasps)
Emergency.
Which serice do you require, please?
Behind me is Brabourne School,..... where news is just in that the missing teenagers have been found after 18 days.
Now the waiting is finally over.
The four teenagers attend Brabourne School,..... where fees are in excess of $30, 000 a year.
Unconfirmed reports say they have been taken to a local hospital,..... where their families have been anxiously waiting.
Michael Steel, son of rock guitarist Stevie Steel, was one of the missing.
- (menacing) See you inside.
- No!
Stop!
I' m Dr Horwood.
I' m here to help you.
I' m not crazy.
It' s just my mum, she won' t listen.
I' il listen.
Do I have to talk about it today?
You make it sound so terrible.
If you trust me and you work with me,..... l really think I can help you feel better.
So we do this at your speed, yeah?
We can stop at any time.
I won' t lie to you: this is going to be difficult,..... but I know that you' re brave enough to get through it.
Let' s try a breathing exercise.
It might seem really... stupid, but let' s just give it a bash, OK?
Take a nice deep breath.
(inhales) Feel your lungs fill up with air.
Drop your shoulders.
And when you exhale, tell all the muscles in your body to relax.
And whenever you feel ready, just start to speak.
This is how it works at Brabourne.
You have to be thin.
Everyone else is wallpaper.
Foryears I was a nobody.
I watched the world from the edges and learned not to dream.
My best friend, Martin, didn' t care.
His philosophy was:
"Take everything you can from them."
He said that theirgreed makes them easy to control.
It made him powerful.
But then the world changed.
Get ready, girls.
Mike Steel is single again.
Mike Steel.
American.
The son ofa rock star.
The missing part ofmy soul.
Please get up.
Get up.
Sorry, mate.
I see why this lot need to wear body armour.
It' s a homoerotic thing.
All that aggression out here,..... then all that steam and soap in the showers.
That' s disgusting.
- (cheering)
(snorts) Maybe Geoff will be Mike' s new bride.
For your information, Martin, he' s dating a supermodel called Amber.
For yours, he' s not.
- You lie.
- Don' t you live here?
Haven' t you noticed that suddenly everyone' s a blonde with cherry lip gloss?
It' s passed you by, thank God.
You' re the last woman with a brain in Brabourne.
- He' s single?
- Half a brain.
Yes.
Please don' t lose it.
I didn' t know.
But he' s just a guy like me.
He shits and farts like the rest of us.
He' s just a fuck of a lot less interesting!
I can' t help it.
It' s an egg thing.
I need him.
(laughs) No, no, no.
No, you love me.
It' s a Martin Taylor fact.
Has there been a day in the last five years that we haven' t talked?
But you' re more like a gay friend than a boyfriend.
- But I' m not gay!
- (players) Yeah, right (!)
It' s the end of term, I' ve got some grateful exes to call..... and most importantly, I am out of here.
Mm.
Bentley, school gates, Friday.
Bye!
Nice time.
Oh, you are such a jockey.
Stevie will have a shitfit if you don' t go.
You think I' m gonna tell him?
I' m gonna lie low in a hotel.
He' il never know.
My arse.
Tabloids are gagging for you.
You are having a wet weekend in Wales... with no hot water, fish paste sandwiches and ten- mile tabs, like it or not.
That' s awful dark, Geoffrey.
Shit, I don' t want to go either.
We have to ditch.
This could kill me.
Frankie' s not going.
She saw wellies on the kit list and nearly had a seizure.
- How' d she get out of it?
- Well, she saw Martin Taylor.
I need to talk to you.
Come.
What' s she done this time?
It' s all gone wrong.
I' ve messed up.
Let me see.
- (others giggle)
Do you mind?
My coursework doesn' t write itself, you know.
- What is it?
- Intensive conditioner.
It should have you sorted in 20 minutes.
- What did you use?
- Peroxide.
- The lab.
I just thought if I was a blonde like Amber, then...
I don' t mean to be rude, but I don' t think doing stuff to yourself..... will make any difference to Mike.
Oh, don' t worry about it.
Trust me, he' s not that wonderful.
Thanks.
I know you don' t have to be nice to me.
Don' t worry about it.
My life has no meaning.
Come in, sit down.
I love him and he doesn' t even know I exist.
I hate seeing you like this.
I' ve got chocolate.
(sighs)
Martin, you don' t understand.
You' ve never had the pain.
God, I feel like I' m dying.
I can help you.
- Really?
- Really.
Welcome to my office.
Now, this is a need- to- know operation.
- Can you do it or not?
- No field trip,..... no parents, no paparazzi?
I can do anything.
And, er..... l' m adding one to your number.
A kindred spirit.
Martin knew that the school and ourparents always believed each other.
He called it the unholy alliance.
If ourparents thought we were in Wales and the school thought we were at home,..... they' d never question it.
Baby
Aye, aye, here come the troops.
(Martin) Jesus, you' re late!
Did anyone see you?
- Just back from the Himalayas (?)
Frankie you know, Geoff I' m sure you' ve heard of.
- None of it is true.
- Except that one about the butter.
And Mike.
Well, call me a muppet, mate, but there' s nothing here.
- You can' t see the wood for the trees.
- Is he taking the piss?
Are you taking the piss, Martin?
I could snap your neck like that, mate.
It' s right here.
Can' t you see it?
You have ten seconds to get interesting.
It' s right beneath your feet.
Watch out, ladies.
Whoa, dude!
Hey, I' m coming down.
Hang on.
(chuckles)
- (whooping)
Oh, man.
- Look at this fucking thing.
- Man, where' d you get the key?
- Wouldn' t you like to know?
- And what is this?
- You know the old war bunker over there?
This is the escape hatch.
(chuckles) You' re so weird, dude.
Will you have to close it?
I need fresh air to keep my skin clear.
It looks beautiful.
- You don' t want to be found, do you?
- No, we certainly don' t.
Nice one.
See you later.
- You' re going in there?
See you inside.
- Yeah.
What is that smell?
It looks like a tomb.
- And?
- And I ain' t goin 'in there.
- Oh, like I care what you think?
Can' t be any worse than Wales, right?
- Me next!
- (Martin) That' s practical, Frankie (!)
- Did you get that smell?
You all right?
Watch out for that bit.
Mikey, look at this, man.
This is huge!
Look at that!
What is that stuff?
Ladies, you are going to love it down here!
I' il get them to send it up to your room, Frankie!
Just be careful with it.
- Jesus, it' s so dark!
- Right, I' m going first.
- Are you going down?
- The ladder stops, mate.
It' s just...
Do you need a light?
Shine it down here.
It' s disgusting!
- (sighs) - Enjoy the Mike Steel experience.
Do you think he' il fall in love with me?
Just be careful.
- Liz, watch the step.
- Mate, look at the pit!
Here, pass the rucksack.
Mind the ledge, it' s really narrow.
- (Liz) Yeah, we' re cool, cheers.
- Close the door!
- Frankie, calm down!
- Can you put the lights on?
I don' t like it!
Oh, God, can' t you find the light switch?
- Would you look at this?
- Lights!
What do you think, girls?
We Luv You) - Aaaaaaaaaah!
We love you
Got no brakes butyou know we got a radio
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
- Get out of the way of the lady!
- You' re gonna die!
- No, man!
- You' re the only one to die!
Would you mind if I boiled water for my pasta?
No, not at all.
Yeah.
Sure.
Cheers, I' il...
It' s great stuff.
It' s got this hole down the middle so it cooks quickly.
Have you got a pan I can borrow?
- There you go.
- What are you having on that?
- Er... nothing.
You can' t have pasta and nothing.
That' s really nice.
- I' ve got salt.
Pasta and salt?
Thanks, though.
- What are you having, then?
- I' m not hungry.
- You' ve got to have something.
- Didn' t really bring anything.
- You didn' t bring any food?
- Not food food.
A bit of gum.
How will you survive on gum for three days?
It didn' t occur to me.
- OK, so food slipped your mind.
- I' ve got food.
Plenty for everyone.
You can have as much as you want.
You have sausages?
Do you have tomato sauce?
- Some.
- You enjoy your pasta, OK?
I' m having sausages...
.. with Liz... tonight.
No... no, thanks.
I' m on a diet.
I' ve got fibre pills to stop me feeling hungry.
OK, it' s my turn.
My friend was driving his girlfriend in his Ferrari...
Who do you know with a Ferrari?
- (Geoff chuckles) - Bob and Sally.
You don' t know them.
Bob and who?
- Fuck off.
Bob and Sally went for a drive, but they ran out of petrol in the middle of nowhere.
Sally was left in the car.
She switched on the radio..... and they said there was like this crazy madman on the loose.
- But she was really tired...
- On the roof of the car.
- With Bob' s head on a stick.
- On a hook!
- No, this really happened!
OK, I' ve got one for you.
Make you cack your pants.
- Shut up, man.
Something happens to Martin.
Doesn' t come back for us.
Told you.
That' s sick.
Possible.
Don' t be stupid.
Geoff, you shouldn' t say that.
What if you make it happen?
How can I make anything happen when I' m here with you?
- How?
- It' s tempting fate!
- Oh, please (!) How does that work?
I don' t believe in fate.
- I' m a Scientologist.
- Oh, yes!
But if anything happens to Martin, it' s Geoff' s fault, OK?
- Fine.
- Is my story the best, or what?
- What happened on the third day?
- Don' t you want to know what we did?
Martin was supposed to let you out, wasn' t he?
- I don' t know!
- What don' t you know?
- I don' t know what happened.
Come on, you' re quite safe here.
Look at me.
It' s the third day.
You' re packed and ready to go.
What' s the time now?
Same as when you asked two minutes ago.
Well, it can' t be the same time if two minutes have passed, can it?
It' s 3. 32, then.
The field trip' s supposed to be back in 30 minutes.
I have a driver waiting.
This is so...
What if he' s been hit by a bus, is in a coma and can' t tell anyone where we are?
- Oh, please.
What if he' s dead?
He' s not dead!
I' il call him.
What' s his number?
- They don' t work down here!
- Here, give me your phone.
You get anything?
No, nothing.
Maybe give it a shot up by the door.
- Does it work?
- You' ve jinxed us.
- This is a wind- up.
No, this is your fault!
You never should have said those things!
Have you thought that maybe the traffic' s heavy?
It' s cool, I' m not worried.
(all scream) Help!
- Everyone just calm...
- What do you think I' m trying to do?
Shut up and let me get on with it!
- Hit it with the pipe, then.
I' il tell you what.
OK, so they know we never went to Wales.
As far as they know, we have a three- day head start,..... which means they could be covering a three- day radius of the school.
So what do we do?
We' re being held to ransom until Martin says so.
We can' t do anything.
Don' t say that!
I mean, he could just be ill.
Isn' t that right, Lizzie?
I don' t know.
Why would he do this?
We' re his friends!
Are we?
Is he really your friend, Frankie?
He' s not mine.
I don' t know a thing about him.
Everything' s just a game to him.
Oh, so this is a game?
Oh, that' s great!
Oh, my God, I paid for this.
Yeah, but he' s careful.
Nothing' s left to chance.
Right now, we' re trapped because he wants us trapped.
Why?
Well, I guess we' re gonna find out.
Look at me.
He didn' t come back.
Martin didn' t come back.
You' ve cracked it!
This fucking great cheer went up.
- Good job, Doctor.
- Thanks, Detective.
The hunt for the kidnapper of the Brabourne teenagers..... took an unexpected turn today,..... as it was announced that police have arrested a pupil from the school.
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons,..... was located in the Dominican Republic,..... where it is believed he was on holiday with his family.
I' ve put together a rough character sketch based on the information we have.
Locking the children in suggests a sociopathic personality.
He probably thinks he' s above the law.
Right now he' s probably creating a very strong alibi.
So the longer he has to conjure up this fiction, the harder it' il be to crack.
If you want a confession, you' il have to act quickly.
(Liz) So,..... when the police arrest Martin, will they put him in a cell?
I presume so.
I hope they do.
Let' s see how he likes it.
- All right, let' s start.
- Er... hang on.
- (bleep) - OK, I' m ready.
- (whispers) Can we talk?
Shall I come over there?
Can I get in?
What' s up?
Can' t sleep?
It... it' s about Martin.
I think he' s watching us.
It could be nothing, I...
I could be wrong..... but I think it might have been him checking up on us.
It probably is him.
(snorts) It' s so funny.
Y' know, Stevie sent me here to protect me from the nut jobs at home.
I think I know what Martin' s doing.
Go on.
Martin wants me to see that..... it was stupid of me to like you when I don' t even know you.
He wants me to hate you.
He hates being wrong,..... so we' re stuck down here till he' s right.
Hold on.
You knew this would happen even before we came down here?
No, of course not.
But it' s the only explanation I can think of.
But what difference does it make?
He likes you, doesn' t he?
Yeah.
Since we were eleven.
(snorts) One of those.
But you..... like me?
Sorry.
Don' t worry about it.
But... how does he know you don' t hate me?
I don' t...
How could he work that out from a split second at the door?
I don' t know.
What is it?
- Yeah.
Are there more?
Try that one over there.
- This one.
- (both gasp) - He' s covered the whole place.
- (clatter) - Jesus Christ!
- Liz, it' s the middle of the night!
What?
She needs a doctor.
That' s obvious (!) I thought you were supposed to be smart.
I bet it' s that dirty toilet water that' s making her ill.
- It' s not my fault!
- (stifles laugh, retches) - This is shit!
This is the worst time I' ve ever had!
I hope I never see you again.
- No!
Things are very bad!
I mean, am I the only one who can smell the toilet?
Who left the monster log that we can' t fucking flush?
We' re fucked, and it' s all your fucking fault!
Why me?
- Because he' s your best friend!
(mouths)
I should' ve never came down here.
As soon as I saw you,..... you fucking geeky little fucking bitch,..... l should' ve turned the other fucking way!
Just stay the fuck away from me, you fucking loser!
You' re not so great yourself, you know.
You' re full of shit!
What are you, anyway?
You' re just a face... and hair!
Oh, shut up, you..... fuckin '..... comebag!
(Liz) We waited and waited, and nothing happened.
- (metallic thump) - But it worked.
The next morning Mike woke me up and the door was open.
We were so happy.
We were out.
We all grabbed each other andjust stood in the light.
It was over.
We' d beaten him.
We' d won.
What Martin didn' t realise was that I' d even won Mike.
We ran up as quickly as we could.
Mike gave me a great big hug and he said "You saved us."
- "You saved us all."
Here we are.
Right.
I told you you' d get through it.
How do you feel?
Lighter.
Last night I even closed the door all the way and I didn' t panic.
Excellent.
You' ve made a lot of progress.
- We' ve still got a lot of work to do.
Yeah, but you' il get there.
It' s... it' s really good.
I' il see you later.
- Tom, it' s Philippa.
- What can I do foryou?
Listen, she thinks she spent the last week in fucking Disneyland!
- I' m sorry.
I didn' t see it coming.
Doesn' t matter, I' il get a confession out ofMartin, no problem.
I mean, how delusional can she be?
So I suppose you' ve got fingerprints?
DNA?
CCTV footage of me creeping around or a stack of witnesses with 20/ 20 (?)
Do you even have a motive?
A bloody good reason why I should lock up a bunch of socialites..... and throw away the key, however tempting that might be?
- What did you do on the last day of term?
Is she thick?
I mean, can they really keep asking the same question hour after hour?
Please.
Just so we' re clear.
I got up at 7am as usual.
I cleaned my teeth and had a shit.
I was down at breakfast by 7. 20am, as usual.
The matron ticked me off the list,..... l had two slices of cold toast with warm butter and sweet tea as usual.
I returned to my study and carried my bags to the school minibus at 8am..... and was sat on the minibus by 8. 05.
I sat beside the driver because I wanted to sit on my own.
We left for the station at 8. 30am and arrived at a not unreasonable 8. 45am.
I bought a Telegraph and a Kit Kat..... and then caught my train promptly at 9. 05 from platform two.
Martin.
We know why you did it, how you did it, the whole fucking lot.
Elizabeth has told us everything.
Well, I knew she was fucked in the head, but I didn' t realise she was this vicious.
Well, you... you know Liz hates me.
You do know that, don' t you?
Thanks for taking me home.
I can' t wait to get into my own bed.
You' il feel better once you get back into your old routine.
Now, if you need anything, day or night, just call me, all right?
You can go back any time you want.
I have to get back to the real world.
You said so yourself.
You really don' t know anything, do you?
They' re thick as thieves!
You' re sure?
They' re practically the same person!
Boring, vain, shallow enough to paddle in.
But Liz is the really nasty one.
Do you have a pen?
This is how it is at Brabourne.
To exist, you eitherhave to be a bitch ora complete slut.
What is it?
Amber dumped Mike half an hour ago.
Oh, fuck.
(giggle and squeal)
It' s the big chance you' ve been waiting for!
Oh, my God, I' m going to be sick.
Move quick, girl, or you' il be auditioning with every peekaboo slut from London up.
I really want him, Frankie.
- I' ve got a plan.
- Let' s hear it.
But this time we camp out.
It' il be perfect.
The sea air, the stars...
I hate beaches.
All that sand up your crack and nowhere to pee apart from the ocean.
And it dries out the complexion.
I' il look 40 after ten minutes and you want me to go for a week?
Remember that place we found and said it' d be great for a party?
The S& M dungeon Martin tried to take you to?
Precisely.
What if we did that?
I could get Mike pretty much on his own for a few days..... and we could even ask Geoff... for you.
- The four of us?
A private party, the end of term.
Me, you, Mike and Geoff.
- (whooping) - Dangerous place for a lady.
- (others) Whooo!
She' s not here for you.
- See you, Geoff.
Couldn' t have come at a better time.
I' m ready if you are.
How would you like to go to the best private party of your life?
- Are you going?
- It' s my party.
- How private?
- You, me,..... Mike and Liz.
- Mike never mentioned it.
- That' s cos you' re inviting him.
- I don' t know if I could do that.
Absolutely extracurricular.
Your parents don' t know and the school doesn' t know.
What we do would be our own business.
But if you' re too pussy, then I' il ask someone else.
- I never said I wasn' t interested.
- In or out?
- In.
- But you have to bring Mike.
I' il have a word with His Highness.
Anything else?
Put your knob away.
Go.
- (Liz) Did you do it?
Done.
(whispers) It will be great.
(whispers) Oh, please (!)
Man, I' m telling you, this is different.
This is ten out of ten.
Frankie and Liz.
Real ten out of ten (!)
So you' re going home to an empty house and fuck the maid again?
You haven' t seen the maid.
Plus..... Amber won' t know where you are.
Won' t be able to find you.
She' il assume you' re having a more exciting time with more famous people.
It' il drive her nuts.
I' m in.
(Martin) When you' re convinced ofyoursuperiority,..... you don' t need help from mere mortals like me.
You can fuck things up all byyourself.
So there you have it.
- I thank you.
- What time did you lock them in the hole?
Because I know you did it.
How dare you be this wrong and this fucking pig- headed!
How dare you put my mother through this!
How do you know it was me?
Come on!
I have to talk to her.
- She can tell me what I need to know.
That' s a risk I have to take.
I' ve nothing on Martin.
In 12 hours, he walks.
Tom, if you say one word to her, I will fucking kill you!
Just let me go.
I' il get the answers.
He' s going to get away with it, isn' t he?
No.
You mustn' t think like that.
Did he ever keep a diary or journal, or anything like that?
I don' t think so.
Did he have a secret hiding place?
No, I don' t know.
Why?
What' s wrong?
You' re not going to let him out, are you?
I' m afraid that' s not my decision.
- He won' t, Liz.
You' re perfectly safe.
- Is he out now?
- No, but he will be in a couple of hours.
- Hours?!
- That' s why I really need you to remember.
- You are safe.
I trusted you!
I thought we were friends!
You' ve been pretending the whole time because you' re paid to!
- That' s not true.
- Leave me alone!
- (Martin, echoing) I can help you.
Nice one.
You don' t want to be found, do you?
Geoff, pass it up!
Give it here!
- You want it, you got it, baby!
- (laughter) (Porn Kings:
So... who do you want first?
(laughs) What are you talking about, Mikey?
I' m dancing.
Wrong approach, mate.
Frankie, I' ve got something for you.
- (kisses) - Oh, fuck off, Geoffrey!
- Stop being such a fucking tourist.
- Jesus.
- Is there sex or not?
Not.
And especially not with you.
And especially not in here.
And why would there be sex?
I mean, what have you done for me?
No, I don' t think so.
Sorry.
And it' s medically proven that teasing (laughs) can ruin a young man' s nuts.
Fuck off, I' ve heard this all before!
Oh, shit!
I need some more!
I' m goin 'first!
Come on!
It' s expensive!
Now I' ve wanted to see this for the last four years.
(Mike) I' ve had this.
It' s OK.
What, seven?
Eight out of ten?
- Mm... four.
- Oh, thank you (!)
- We were, what, 13?
I mean, it was a one- night stand.
It wasn' t exactly memorable.
It was a long time ago and I' m a lot better now.
- (Mike croons) But you liked it.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Yes, oh, yes!
Thank you!
(laughs) (Geoff, laughing) How does it go?
That' s it, no more free feels.
You must be joking.
What am I meant to do with the old man?
- Suck it off, big boy.
Ten out of ten.
- What?
What did she do?
- (chuckles) - Oh, go on, give us a look, Franks.
- What did she do?
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on, do it again!
- Forget it, it' s supposed to be a party.
It' s a shit party, but it' s a party nonetheless.
You always get to see everything.
I never get to see the good bits.
- Can' t we have the light on?
I can' t sleep if it' s light.
- Well, it' s too dark to sleep!
Shut your eyes.
Well, I can' t tell when my eyes are open or closed, it' s so fucking dark!
- It' s only me.
(squeals and giggles)
- Can we get some sleep, please!
- Will you shut up!
Turn the light off.
(Tom) She must have spent days picking the lock, but she did it.
She beat him and I' il beat him too.
Little shit ofa schoolboy.
His website, "Disciples of Chaos,"..... is anarchist bullshit about disrupting stock exchanges, air traffic control,..... the Web itself.
I' m gonna nail him.
I don' t think he' s angry enough to have done it.
- No problem.
Shall we go straight there?
- Sure.
- It' s not far, it' s just up the hill.
- I' m not great with small spaces.
- Neither am l.
I can' t stand them.
But that will be the least of your worries when you get down there.
- What were they doing here?
- Trying to have a good time.
They had plenty of booze, they' d wired up some party lights.
(TV) The prime suspect has been released without charge.
The police have yet to make any formal statement..... and it is understood that investigations are proceeding satisfactorily.
The families have requested that the press res... (turns TV off)
You can' t go!
The trip doesn' t get back for two days!
- Mate, you said you' d do this.
- Fuck the trip.
OK, yeah, fuck things up for the rest of us.
Get him to stay!
- I won' t tell anyone, OK?
You' il ruin everything.
Look, I' m not gonna stay down here and listen to you fuck each other' s brains out.
I' m trying.
- I' m leaving too!
- Not you as well (!)
I' m not playing gooseberry.
Are you going straight home?
We could stop by the station and get a pizza.
- No.
Thanks, though.
- C' mon, trains go to London all the time.
I...
I' m gonna go by Amber' s, see if we can patch things up.
Amber?
But she humiliated you.
How the fuck would you know anything about that?
Your weed, mate.
- Mate, you said you' d do this.
- You said it' d be fun.
- It is!
You' il have a great weekend.
Please.
Enjoy this.
Stay.
You' re gonna have a great time.
You' il be here completely by yourselves.
- (sighs)
Can you move out of the way?
(whispers) Watch this.
Fuck!
It won' t open.
- Well, push it, you twat.
- The handle' s stuck.
You are such a donkey, mate.
Oi, Liz!
Down.
- You are such a cretin.
- Look, I' m not fucking retarded, OK?
- The fucking door won' t open!
- Get out of the way!
- Who was the last one down?
- It was Geoff.
- How fucking hard did you slam it?
- It wasn' t me, it was Liz!
It slammed itself.
- Doors don' t just slam themselves locked.
I didn' t know we' d get stuck, did l?
- You' re sorry?!
That' s just fucking great (!)
What do we do?
Do we just fucking rot?
I guess... we just wait to be found.
In two days, my parents are going to be up there waiting for me.
If I' m not there, they' il know I told a pack of lies and I' il be up to my arse in shit!
Good point.
My parents' il go berserk!
Good fucking job, asshole!
- I don' t know!
Shit!
I am in so much trouble!
Perfect (!)
(pounds on door) Help!
Anyone!
Help!
- (pipes clatter) - Somebody try the glass.
We have to do something that might open the fucking door!
(Mike, echoing) Fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!
You all right?
Why don' t we sit down?
It' s been a nightmare for forensics.
They can barely lift a usable print.
It' il take us six months to sift through all the hair and fibre we lifted.
What about the listening devices?
The kids probably mistook the small air vents for microphones.
Lack of food and water would have made them confused and paranoid.
So do you have anything to tie Martin Taylor to the scene?
Not yet.
But he will have left something somewhere.
And we' il find it.
Thanks.
You bitch!
Sorry!
- Bullshit!
- Bullshit!
How could you do this to me, Lizzie?
You fucking betrayed me!
I knew they would!
They' ve tapped my phone, they tried to follow me here!
- They want me for the whole thing!
- They can' t prove anything!
- If they could, they would have by now!
- You grassed me up, you bitch!
What happened?
Please.
I don' t feel safe.
(sobs) I don' t want to be alone.
- All right.
- Please.
Take a deep breath.
Listen, I can help you, but you' ve got to stop playing games.
Some people need to know what happened.
They don' t care how terrible your story is.
They want to know the truth.
I want to know the truth too!
I want to go back to the hole.
Absolutely not!
I keep getting glimpses of what happened.
I' il be doing something like tying my laces and I' il turn around... and I' il see Frankie.
But when I try to remember, I can' t.
Nothing at all.
(sobs) And I don' t know what happened.
I want to know, but I can' t remember.
And we can work through this.
I need to go back to the hole.
There' s no escape, Tom.
Mrs Dunn called again,..... pissing and moaning Dr Horwood' s run away with her child.
Saying she' il call the press, the Complaints Commission, if we don' t find her!
But I bet you they' re having a bloody pizza somewhere.
- Go on.
Amaze me.
It' s about Martin Taylor.
Come on!
Looks different.
I don' t even feel like I' ve been here before.
Your weed, mate.
Dude, you' re getting laid.
(Geoff) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
We weren' t locked in from the outside.
Shit!
I am in so much trouble!
Fuck!
The stupid...
Did you try the glass?
(Liz) What could I do?
I couldn' t let him leave.
Carry on.
The water' s gone off.
- I just went for a drink.
There' s no water.
What?
What' s happened?
After you start to feel thirsty,..... you find yourself feeling impatient.
Maybe even a little sick.
Then your pulse starts to go up.
Then there' s the headaches, dizziness...
(sniffs) When it gets bad, your vision will blur and you' il find it hard to walk and talk.
Your tongue swells up.
Your skin shrivels.
You twitch.
You go deaf.
And then you die.
How long does this take?
From when we run out of water, about three or four days.
- How do you know all this?
It' s gonna be OK, Liz!
We' re bound to get rescued!
They will!
Next week we' il be down the pub having a laugh.
- (sobs) - I promise you.
And I' m buying, all right?
It' s gonna be all right.
We' il go out and buy lots of new things.
And there' s all those exciting exams to look forward to.
They' re great.
- You' ve got a hard- on for everything.
- Not for you, mate.
I' m OK.
Have you ever loved someone so much..... you didn' t care what happened to yourself?
You just had to be with them.
If they look atyou,..... yourheart stops.
Ifyou feel theirbreath on yourskin,..... youjust ache.
Have you ever craved someone so much..... that you didn' t exist any more?
No.
Well, I have.
- (turns music off) - Frankie' s sick.
Look, I' m serious.
She' s very, very sick.
So you' re fucking her now?
He really doesn' t kiss the way I thought he would.
-.. but he kisses really hard.
You know, you could have told me about you and Mike.
But I suppose it doesn' t matter any more.
(yelps happily) We' re getting on so well!
It' s like we' ve been together for ages.
- (gasps) - I think he' s falling in love with me.
- (coughs and retches) - He is.
Yeah, he is, I can feel it.
- (spits and gasps) - We' il probably sleep together tonight.
- (gasps) - I bet we' il get out tomorrow.
Iike someone will find us, right?
- (gives sobbing gasp) - Do you think you can hang on that long?
- Get away from her!
Frankie...
- (shrieks) - Frankie, wake up!
- Frankie, speak to me!
What' s wrong?
Oh, shit!
What have you done to her?
Frankie, what' s wrong?
Wake up!
What' s wrong?
You fucking killed her!
What have you done?
- What did she do to you?
(crying) Geoff, it' s fucking horrible.
Please stop touching her.
Please, Geoff.
She' s fucking dead!
Stop fucking touching her!
(Liz whispers) I' m so sorry, Frankie.
What... what... what happened, what did I do?
You were my best friend.
What am I going to do?
I' m sorry, Frankie...
Don' t fucking look at me like that!
I hate it when people look at me like that.
It' s not my fault if you don' t like what I have to say.
Frances was bulimic.
We know that from the lack of enamel on her teeth.
The dramatic bleeding came from a tear in her oesophagus.
She died on the tenth day from heart failure.
Carry on.
Do you think she' il haunt us?
She' il haunt you.
Why me?
Why you?
Why you?!
You fucking bitch!
Your idea, your fault!
You!
- Does that help at all (?) It' s shit in here.
- You!
She' s sorry! lsn' t it obvious?
She didn' t do it on purpose!
Just fucking leave it!
You' re right.
I didn' t give a fuck about Frankie.
We' re just a pair of assholes.
(Liz) I keep thinking about her mum and her dad..... and how they' re going to feel when they find out.
I' ve killed all of you!
- No, you didn' t.
- (sobs) I did, it' s my fault!
I' m sorry!
It' s not your fault, OK?
I don' t know what happened to Frankie, but it wasn' t you, OK?
- Really?
OK?
So what we' ve got to do is try our best to keep strong.
I don' t really blame you, Liz.
I' m just going nuts.
I keep thinking I can smell the body.
I think I' d rather tear my face off..... than smell her rot.
(softly) I' ve got such a terrible headache.
Everything' s blurry.
I know what that means.
It' s all right, Geoff.
Don' t think about it.
Take it.
(whispers) Take it.
(whispers) Thank you.
- (gasps)
- I' m sorry...
- What are you talking about?
- I' m sorry.
- You' re not well, you should lie down.
I have to tell you something.
- No.
No.
Please stop torturing yourself, OK?
It' s not important any more, OK?
It' s not your fault.
No, I have to tell you something.
- No, Mikey!
I was going to share!
- (grunts)
Geoffrey Bingham.
Severe head injuries.
This one was murdered.
We could go together.
Fuck, no.
I can' t do this any more.
We could still be found.
We' re not going to be found.
They would have found us by now.
Mike, it' d be really quick, right?
- We' il just fade away and it' il be over...
- You' re stronger than that!
We' ve kept going this long, we can hold out.
It' s worth it.
Lizzie, I can' t do this without you.
If you go, I' il have nothing.
I need you.
I love you, Liz.
How the fuck did you do that?
(wavering) The key.
I always had it.
But I couldn' t tell you.
But it... it was all for you.
For me?
Because I love you.
All this was for you.
For me?
I killed my best friend.
(sobs) You let me think I was going to die, and you watched me kill my best friend.
I killed him for a fucking Coke!
You let Frankie die!
You fucking held her hand..... and you let her die, you fucking bitch!
Fuckin 'whore!
I didn' t mean...
You don' t understand!
No, Mike!
He was the reason I breathed.
I stayed there,..... felt my heart die,..... my soul wither.
(sighs) I wanted to be with him so much..... that I couldjust feel myself stepping into the air.
He never leaves.
This way hejust... stays perfect.
You need to say what you' ve just said to me on tape,..... with a solicitor and your parents present.
Why?
Your statement needs to be official.
- I' m not making a statement.
- You have to.
That' s what the families and everybody - the police - have been waiting for.
I just told you: they' re not going to understand.
Look, even you don' t understand.
I don' t see why I should be punished.
It was an accident!
- You' re still responsible.
- I' m not ruining my life for this!
It' s out of your hands.
Martin will corroborate what you' ve told me.
Everyone is dead, and you told them that I locked you in!
I had no idea you couldn' t get out!
It' s too late.
What the fuck are you doing?
- Help!
Help!
- (softly) Thank God.
Thank God.
- What' s wrong?
- It' s OK.
- I thought she was going to hurt me.
We have Martin.
You' re in deep shit.
- Yeah.
Suicide.
Guilty as hell.
This is the captain speaking.
We' re just now passing the Arctic Circle which means we' re in the Land of the Midnight Sun.
Please, sit still.
- What about your suitcase?
- Probably on its way to Murmansk.
- What is it like in the winter?
- The opposite, completely dark.
Take it easy.
- The light was red.
- It was green.
Yes, of course it was green.
My memory fails me.
ls everything all right?
- What about her clothes?
- She was naked.
- Nothing else?
- Just a necklace and two earrings.
- Where are they?
- They' ve been checked.
You' il have a preliminary report tomorrow.
Where are they?
You came quickly.
What do you know about the case?
She left a party in the middle of the night, Saturday.
Found at the garbage dump 30 hours later.
That' s all.
Did she have a record?
Did you know her?
No...
But I saw her sometimes.
- Where?
- She lived in an apartment nearby.
Let' s take a look.
We won' t find anything, Tom.
He' s even washed her hair.
Her hands and nails were scrubbed too.
- Perfectionist.
- Even the best makes mistakes.
- How did you get here before us?
- Vacation...
I have family here.
The police in Stockholm raided an apartment building.
They stormed in fully armed.
He sat up in bed and shouted...
That' s when they recognized him.
The chief inspector?
ln a very intimate conversation with the main witness.
Take your time.
- When did they meet?
- 9 months ago.
Right after she moved to town.
They were together all the time.
They had an argument that night.
- Does he have an alibi?
- Not for late that night.
- Where did she get money?
- Grants...
Her parents are dead.
Dolce & Gabbana!
At least 6000 kroners.
She didn' t need this.
Maybe it was exactly what she needed.
- What do you mean?
- Boosts your self- confidence.
You need that when you' re 17.
At least I did.
Don' t forget this.
We' il call a press conference when we have something to tell you.
He might have followed her from the party.
An argument lead to a fight.
He panicked.
This murder is no accident.
It' s been carried out with too much knowledge.
You might be right about that...
What knowledge?
The way all clues have been removed.
I' m glad you' re here.
I' m told you are good.
When did you last see her...
Eilert?
- It' s in the report.
- Yes, but I want you to tell me.
- At the party.
- Can you move over a bit?
These rooms are too small.
- What did you do at the party?
- The usual.
Drinking...
Dancing...
Partying.
Your friends told us different.
- What did they say?
- What do you think?
I don' t know.
They' re not my friends.
- Oh... why not?
- Because they' re lying.
- What?
- They' re lying!
Why are they lying?
- Were you Tanja' s boyfriend?
- Yes.
- Nice girl.
- Tanja left the party...
... at a quarter past two.
Did you follow her?
- No.
- When did you leave then?
I stayed on for a while, and then I went home.
Did Tanja like other men to look at her?
Listen...
I don' t understand fuckin 'Swedish.
Me neither.
You got jealous.
You argued, and she ran off to someone else.
Bullshit.
Her clothes...
Do you know how much they cost?
She couldn' t afford them... and neither could you.
She saw someone else.
He gave her gifts.
Maybe she needed his attention?
You weren' t enough, Eilert.
- Who did she go to?
- I don' t know.
Come on.
Let' s get this over with.
She went to some guy.
I don' t know who he is.
- How do you know?
- I just found out.
How do you know?
Coffee?
I' m so fed up with reviving dead people.
- It' s what you make of it.
- No, it isn' t.
You should' ve seen her clothes.
At least 60 dresses!
I once met a woman with 50 pairs of shoes.
- What did she want them for?
- I have no idea.
Let' s get this job done quickly, Erik.
Oh... are we in a rush?
I applied for a job in Norway.
Not North Norway.
- I' ve been here before.
- I know.
- You do?
- Yes, you told me about it.
A post office robbery in the spring of 1972.
Please don' t knock on the counter.
- ClD.
- And...?
Engstrom and Vik.
I thought maybe I' d done something wrong.
Talk to him about that.
You must see a lot of weird things.
- Working for the police, I mean.
- We see a lot of pretty things too.
Don' t flirt with me.
- I' m on duty.
- So are we.
When you' ve been a policeman long enough, nothin' s weird.
Your luggage arrived before you.
Good.
I' ve nearly been here before.
It reminds me of a hotel on the west cost where we stay when we visit my in- laws.
One morning we woke up with a couple standing in our room.
I tried to get rid of them but they insist that it' s their room.
Eva got really upset.
Yes.
They insist that it' s their room...?
Room?
What interests did she have?
What dreams?
Who did she associate with?
Who did she want to associate with?
Which teachers did she like and dislike?
Which boys did she like?
Or maybe she didn' t like?
Everything is equally important.
It' s absurd that Tanja is gone.
It' s hard to understand that she won' t be sitting here tomorrow.
Or next week...
Because she is dead... murdered.
What did she want?
- Who?
- Hagen.
What is it with you and Hagen?
Nothing.
The body of a 17 year old...
What did she want?
They' ve found Tanja' s backpack.
- When did you find the bag?
- Two hours ago.
Outside an old shed near the dump.
Some kids found it.
- Why isn' t Tom here?
- He' s finished.
He' s already checked it for finger...
Where is he?
On his way to the shed.
Stop him.
Find out who she went to the movies with.
Astrid, maybe the staff remember something.
The Moment.
Jon Holt...
"Pia falls in love with Thomas,
"but thinks he' s hiding something from her.
"A voice inside Pia' s head tells her
"how to get rid of the problem."
Anyone here read crime novels?
Yes.
Nobody goes near the shed.
lf the perpetrator thinks the bag may reveal him, he' il come and get it.
It was the same school bag the murdered Tanja Lorentzen had with her when she left the party on Sunday morning.
It' s not been found.
lf you see or find such a bag, then please contact the police.
It may contain clues which will lead us to Tanja' s killer.
Maybe he doesn' t watch TV.
Oh, yes.
There' s nothing else to do around here.
Am I upsetting you?
You probably hear jokes like that all the time.
He' s here.
Wait till he picks up the bag, then we follow him.
Quietly.
Freeze!
Police!
He went into the shed.
Let' s get him.
You can' t get anywhere now.
Please come out.
Zakariassen!
Down to the sea, and follow the waterline.
Erik, you take the hillside, and when you reach the bay, you go left.
Here... here... here...
- Which way did he go?
- There...
You said to the right...
You said to the right.
Then I found Zakariassen laying between the stones and...
He pointed.
I ran in the direction he pointed.
Then I saw a figure disappear behind a stone...
Then I slipped.
I heard a shot, and saw him running towards me.
First he shoots Vik, and then he runs straight towards you.
What?
After he shot Vik...
Did the perpetrator run straight towards you?
I suppose he didn' t see me.
It was foggy.
And then?
When he saw me, he turned abruptly and ran back.
I ran after him down towards the sea.
Then he turned again.
Shot at me - missed - and ran further.
That' s when I spotted Erik and stopped to... help him.
Describe the man you saw.
It' s that fucking map' s fault!
Every stone is marked on it, but not the bunker below the shed.
Yes, most unfortunate.
lf I' d known about that tunnel, I' d had a man down there.
We should always be armed, like you do in Sweden.
- When will the autopsy take place?
- Tomorrow.
The bullet' s in his spine.
The bullet is no good without the weapon.
Don' t worry.
One of your detectives will handle the Vik case.
We need a special permit to be armed, and there was no reason in this case - as we couldn' t imagine...
We heard you were the first to arrive at the crime scene.
What did you see?
It was very foggy.
I was the first person to reach the beach, and found Vik lying there.
There was nothing I could do.
How does it feel to lose a colleague like that?
Damn sad.
- Does it hurt?
- What?
You' ve been on the TV all night.
Did you work together for a long time?
Just over a year.
- Weird.
- What?
He was standing there yesterday.
I wish I' d been nicer to him.
Don' t worry.
You could say anything to him.
He was...
Do you have masking tape?
- Masking tape?
- Masking tape.
- How does it feel?
- Well...
Like a horse kicked you?
I thought you came to turn out the light.
Thanks.
- It was irresponsible.
- What?
To send you after him.
It was irresponsible.
The guy was armed.
How could we know?
Madman.
Waving his arms around before he shot.
- Did you see him shoot Vik?
- No, I didn' t see anything.
It can' t be easy.
He was a nice chap.
Have they removed the bullet?
It went straight through.
Just a flesh wound.
Good.
We need you.
He knew it might be a trap.
That' s why he was armed.
He' s cold, calculating and thinks he' s more intelligent than the police.
His arrogance will lead him to make a mistake.
Tanja' s bag contains something that may convict the killer, or at least the killer thinks so.
We have to check its contents more thoroughly.
We have to confront Tanja' s classmates with its contents and knock on all doors between the house of the party and the crime scene.
Tom... your preliminary conclusion.
Tanja Lorentzen died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
We assume that she didn' t die instantly.
No sexual assaults.
No sperm.
Nothing.
He worked with Erik for a long time.
I' il be handling the Vik case.
Good.
- We' il just have to do our best.
- Of course.
We shall remember Erik Vik as a sociable and proud policeman with one minute' s silence.
Something wrong?
He was lying on his stomach.
Not on his back.
- Was this where you found Vik?
- Yes.
Okay.
We found this next to where Zakariassen was.
Good.
Make sure Tom runs a match with the bullet.
Reminds me of a hotel where we stay when we visit my in- laws...
Then one morning we woke up, and there' s a couple...
- Do you have something to drink?
- Something strong?
Cognac?
Watch the reception desk.
- Do you like whiskey?
- Yes, sure.
- Cheers!
- I' m not allowed to do this.
Talk to strange men in the middle of the night?
No.
We have to drink in silence...
How about you?
Don' t you ever ask anybody for permission?
Not to drink with you.
Don' t you have a family?
No.
That' s a pity...
It' s nice to be alone too.
Do you have any sisters or brothers?
No...
I once had a brother, but he died when I was 11.
I don' t know anybody who has a dead brother.
It' s not that strange.
I thought it was embarrassing.
When I came to school, the others didn' t know anything.
I didn' t say anything.
But they must have asked for him?
Yes, but I invented stories about where he was and what had happened to him.
As time went by the stories got more and more unlikely...
I' d better go upstairs.
Your colleague was here looking for you.
- Who?
- He didn' t introduce himself.
- What did he look like?
- A bit older than you.
A bit rough...
I never remember how people look.
Just the impression they make.
- What impression did he make?
- A bit nervous.
Smiled all the time.
Did he leave a message?
He' d seen something.
He wanted to talk to you...
- ls it important?
- No, I don' t think so.
Aren' t you going to finish your whiskey?
Another time.
Froya?
- You' re Froya Selmer.
- You' re the cop.
I have to talk to you.
Can you come over here?
You might' ve looked better in a uniform.
- You went to that party.
- I was wasted.
Too wasted to remember what happened?
Nothing happened.
That' s why I got wasted.
- Was Tanja just as "loaded"?
- "Loaded"?
Drunk.
Nobody understood anything you said.
Pardon?
- ln the classroom.
- But you understood?
It' s not the first time I' ve met a Swede.
Was it Tanja' s boyfriend you spoke to?
Why did you ask when you knew the answer?
- Will you come for a ride?
- A ride with you?
Don' t you want to?
- May I smoke?
- No.
Show me something cool!
"Something cool"?
Something cool.
I don' t know what' s cool any more.
Let me out!
Here you go...
Maybe you' d like me to accompany you?
- I think you know.
- Know what?
Where Tanja got all her nice clothes.
How should I know?
Did she have a better friend than you?
Here, you see...
This is where they found her... in a garbage bag.
Tanja had a relationship with an older man.
Older than me.
He paid for her expensive clothes.
You told Eilert about him.
He would' ve found out anyway.
But you told him... at that party.
She didn' t have to go...
It was her own fault.
What' s his name?
The man she was with?
I never spoke to him.
She was really weird about it.
Like it was something special... having an affair with him.
- Who?
- An old pig.
Where did they meet?
She wrote him a letter.
She had read one of his books.
Was completely hooked.
What' s his name?
The author.
Jon Holt.
That wasn' t hard - was it?
I' il take you home now.
Yes...
Engstrom.
I don' t want any more visits.
Jon Holt...
We have to meet.
No, not the two of us together.
I suppose you understand?
Why not?
Keep the police away from me, and you' il sleep much better.
There are two pages missing from the book.
- They' ve been torn out.
- What was written on those pages?
I went to Tanja' s apartment to check.
Did you find the pages?
I found another copy of the same book.
- Must be a damn good book then?
- What was written on the pages?
A description of two young people infatuated with one another.
So Tanja buys a new book because two pages are missing.
No.
The other book was signed
"To Tanja" with Holt' s own signature.
Well done, Arne.
We' il have to ask the author if he remembers her.
Engstrom...
I need a word.
Yes, of course.
- Did Vik have any problems?
- Problems?
I just heard his memory failed him.
No, he was a very competent policeman.
I can' t understand your explanation at the reconstruction.
You said you were here when the perpetrator shot at you.
Yes, exactly.
And that' s where you saw Erik Vik.
Yes.
I have compared the photos with your statement.
It' s not possible to see Erik Vik in the water from the distance...
Not in heavy fog.
I might have been a few yards closer...
- You must have been 15...
- We' re chasing a killer.
Would you like to change your statement?
You do it, if you want to.
Hello...
Let me take you to the hospital.
- Where does bus 27 go?
- Pardon?
Bus 27.
Follow it!
Thanks for calling.
Have we met?
No... but I' ve gotten to know someone you used to know.
I know very few.
Thin, little girl... with dark hair.
- No, I don' t think so.
- Don' t pretend.
You were stupid enough to give her signed books.
My colleagues are looking for you.
Oh, you mean the young girl at the hotel reception...
She' s a blond, isn' t she?
Was it wise of you to come to the hotel?
I needed some support.
But you' re never there during the night... she said.
She has nothing to do with this.
No, but she' s very cute...
Likes you, and...
I can tell these things straight away.
What' s her name again?
I don' t know.
You could have asked.
You look good on TV.
It' s really strange...
I' ve always had such deep respect for the police.
Yet sometimes one has to alter the truth a bit.
An author understands that.
- Do you suffer from acrophobia?
- No.
I stood right behind you...
I saw you.
Saw you lift the gun and shoot your friend.
But the bullet we have is from your gun...
You lost your gun.
There' s never been any weapons registered to me.
Couldn' t you just have admitted it?
A short suspension and back to work, everything as it used to be.
Nobody is perfect.
You did nearly everything right.
Enticed her out to a deserted place.
Beat her to death.
Cleaned up after yourself.
Washed her...
Even washed her hair.
I' ve been doing those things for 20 years.
Trying to imagine what happens afterwards...
when you really cross the line.
What happens here.
The fiction became too boring...
When you' ve put all the pieces together... the account balances.
Nothing is missing.
You have complete control.
Complete control.
It' s all just mathematics...
But it' s impossible to calculate such a thing.
You realize that afterwards, when you' ve been there yourself.
- You know that...
- I know nothing of the sort.
What do you know about her boyfriend?
- Who?
- Her boyfriend.
Eilert...
What about him?
We' il have to make up a story about him.
Do you think it' s him?
Well, he met Tanja several times.
I' m looking for Froya Selmer.
Her parents don' t know where she is.
- Who?
- You know her, don' t you?
- What does she look like?
- You spoke to her yesterday.
- What did she say?
- Not much.
She was scared.
- Why didn' t you tell me?
- I' m telling you now.
That' s not good enough.
We have to cooperate.
I' m sorry...
Shall we go in?
Where were you on the night of May 28th?
I' m always at home during the night.
That' s when I write.
- Were you alone?
- Yes, I like to be alone at night.
It' s worse during the day.
- No alibi?
- I' ve never needed an alibi.
How did you get to know Tanja Lorentzen?
She appeared at my door.
Strange girl.
She' d read one of my books.
Was very engaged in the story.
She thought there was something wrong with my angle.
What was the book about?
Some youngsters who were very co- dependent...
She has fantasies about killing him to...
To get rid of him...
Read it yourself.
I did.
What kind of relationship did you have?
She thought it was exciting to meet an author.
Did you have sex?
She was about 15.
- Did you have sex?
- No.
Why not?
Why not?
I was like a father to her.
She had a lot of problems.
What kind of problems?
She didn' t want to talk about them.
So how do you know she had problems?
She was always covered in bruises...
On her arms... on her neck.
Everywhere.
Did you ever ask her why?
She fell down when she drank.
You think her boyfriend knocked her around?
She had a lot of "bad luck".
You saw her several times.
Secret meetings.
Became a father to her.
But when she' s murdered, you don' t even go to the police...
Come here...
I' il show you something.
Look here.
He can barely see you.
No...
I suppose that' s just as well.
So he has something to look forward to, you mean?
No, I think they' re disgusting.
They' re just a bit helpless.
- Where is their mother?
- She died.
- Don' t touch me!
- I' m sorry... sorry.
I just wanted to show you the kittens.
There is someone in the room.
I sit up in bed.
They insist it' s their room.
Yes, they insist.
The guy threatens to throw me out.
I ask who the hell he thinks he is.
"Erik Vik" he says.
I say:
"What?"
"Erik Vik, Oslo".
The reception mixed up the bookings.
- Hope you' il clean up.
- That' s what we' re doing.
Here!
That' s not mine!
Let me go!
Jonas... is everything okay?
I' m not sleeping well.
You' re sick.
You' ve already made it all up in your nasty mind.
You are so sick.
Don' t make this worse.
We' ve found your weapon.
A bullet from it was found in our colleague' s chest.
What happened?
How did you get the gun?
I don' t have a gun, damn you.
- Do you want an attorney?
- I haven' t done anything...
I didn' t do anything!
Back to Oslo' s underworld?
No, I' m going home.
This was my last job in Norway.
How can you take it?
Take what?
Two bodies in one week.
I' ve had it up to here.
It made me think of you seeing this year after year.
You get used to it.
You just have to avoid mixing your job and your personal life.
What the hell do you want?
- ls everything okay?
- Of course.
- I don' t know if I can trust you.
- What do you mean?
You' re not quite sane.
You don' t even sleep at night.
- Who told you?
- Tanja.
She visits me at night.
Doesn' t give in.
What else did she say?
That you should be careful who you team up with.
I should have known that.
You should be very careful who you team up with.
Tanja should have thought of that.
It was an accident.
She called me in the middle of the night.
She was wild.
Her boyfriend had dumped her.
Do you understand?!
It was an accident.
Don' t worry.
Everything' s been taken care of.
She misunderstood.
I just wanted to comfort her.
But then I got so turned on.
She noticed.
Only once, and that was too much.
- Calm down!
- She didn' t bleed much.
She was just very tired.
I put her to bed.
Afterwards I tried to wake her, but she just wanted to sleep.
She slept and slept and slept...
Calm down now!
That friend of yours...
Did he get too close to you?
Was that why you shot him?
Go away.
There' s nothing you can do.
Get lost.
I know about a quiet place... where I can write.
Nice to see you again.
We were worried about you.
Your parents didn' t know where you were.
Have you come to tell us something?
She' s going to drive me home.
Somebody' s lying in this case.
Froya tells me quite a different story about Tanja.
- Like what?
- Eilert never hit her.
Froya... when did you last see Eilert?
ls that so important?
I' m just trying to clarify her relationship with Eilert.
You' re in love with him, aren' t you?
It was that writer.
He could get completely crazy.
Relax.
Just get into the car and I' il drive you home.
Eilert wasn' t nasty.
He never was.
One more thing...
The fingerprints on the actual gun were wiped clean but Tom found one under the barrel that didn' t belong to Eilert.
That just proves that someone else touched the gun.
I want Holt' s fingerprints.
- I' il get a search warrant.
- I' ve already got one.
Good.
Drive Froya home and I' il see you at Holt' s apartment as soon as possible.
Nobody here.
We' il find him.
I' il put out an APB on him.
Take his toothbrush to start with.
You' il probably find his fingerprints on it.
Get some sleep.
You look tired.
Jon!
Calm down.
I' ve just come to talk.
I know it was an accident.
She started to laugh... she just laughed.
I never touched her.
You buy her dresses for 20, 000 kroners and take her to a shed to fuck her.
Just once...
Just one single time.
She took my hand...
She touched my neck, and then... she touched me above my eyes.
She smelt so strange.
And she was very warm.
Too warm.
Didn' t you manage?
I tried.
I don' t want to listen to that crap.
Wait!
I' ve rarely come across a more calculated killer.
He planned every detail.
He even washed her hair.
It' s wrong.
Holt' s no killer type.
It could' ve been an accident.
He did shoot Vik.
Panic.
I' m glad you' re the one who was called in.
I have to admit you really lived up to your reputation.
Never gives up...
Not until the case is solved.
Your spirit has been an inspiration for all of us.
Engstrom...
Am I disturbing you?
No, come in.
What a surprise.
I' ve come to give you something.
What?
I went back to the crime scene.
Found a cartridge case.
A Norma.
That' s a Swedish make.
- The Swedish police use them.
- Yes.
Say what you have to say.
"The dual substance of Christ - the yearning, so human, so superhuman, of man to attain God... has always been a deep inscrutable mystery to me.
My principle anguish and source of all my joys and sorrows from my youth onward has been the incessant, merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh... and my soul is the arena where these two armies have clashed and met. "
NlKOS KAZANTZAKlS
From the book "The Last Temptation Of Christ"
This film is not based upon the Gospels but upon this fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict.
The feeling begins.
Very tender, very loving.
Then the pain starts.
Claws slip underneath the skin and tear their way up...... just before they reach my eyes, they dig in.
And I remember.
First I fasted for three months.
I even whipped myself before I went to sleep.
At first it worked.
Then the pain came back.
And the voices.
They call me by name.
Who is it?
Who are you?
Why are you following me?
Are you ready?
No more crosses.
We' re ready.
Where is your mind?
Do you hear what I' m saying?
The Messiah won' t come that way.
What do you mean by that?
Who told you?
You' re a disgrace!
Romans can' t find anyone to make crosses, except for you!
You do it!
You' re worse than them!
You' re a Jew killing Jews.
You' re a coward!
How will you ever pay for your sins?
With my life, Judas.
I don' t have anything else.
Don' t turn away.
Look at me.
With your life.
What do you mean?
Please, Judas.
Are you still taking the cross?
- Yes, I am.
- No, you' re not.
I won' t let you!
- I won' t let you.
- Please, I beg you, don' t get in the way.
What way?
- What' s happened to you?
- I' m struggling.
- With who?
I' m struggling.
I struggle.
You collaborate.
Traitor!
You are the people of lsrael.
Your children are watching.
You are the people of God.
He is judging us.
He is watching you.
- There he is.
- Kill him!
Don' t touch him.
Get away from him!
- Don' t you defend him.
- He' s my son.
God is with us.
He' s judging us.
Fight!
God help us!
God give us strength!
Come.
Come with me.
"This man, naked before you now, is condemned for sedition...
SEDlTIO
"He rallied the people to revolution.
"He promised that a Messiah would come from among the people...
"... to rise up and destroy Rome."
Rome is nothing.
"Murder...
"... betrayal...
"... looting and so on, and so therefore, he is condemned to die.
"Rome condemns him.
"And all the gods of Rome condemn him."
God is our shield.
He is our heart.
He is our shield.
He will not abandon you.
He will not abandon you.
God!
God loves me, I know he loves me.
I want him to stop.
I can' t take the pain.
The voices and the pain.
I want him to hate me.
I make crosses so he' il hate me.
I want him to find somebody else.
I want to crucify every one of his messiahs.
You' re sure it' s God?
You' re sure it' s not the devil?
I' m not sure.
- I' m not sure of anything.
- If it' s the devil, the deviI can be cast out.
But what if it' s God?
You can' t cast out God, can you?
Who' s that?
Who' s following me?
Is that you?
Magdalene.
Thank you, Lord...... for bringing me where I did not want to go.
He must be one of God' s angels.
He came down to show me the way.
Who' s out there?
Who is it?
What are you doing here?
I want you to forgive me.
I' ve done too many bad things.
I' m going to the desert, and I need you to forgive me...... before I go, please.
I see.
You sit out there all day with the others...... and then come in here with your head down, saying, "Forgive me."
"Forgive me."
It' s not that easy.
Just because you need forgiveness, don' t ask me to do it.
- I' m sorry - Get out!
Go away!
Look, Mary...... look at this.
God can change this.
God can save your soul.
He already broke my heart, he took you away from me.
And I hate both of you.
Hate me, blame me.
It' s all my fault, but not God' s.
- Don' t say that about God.
- Who made me feel this way about God?
I know, that' s why I' m here.
It' s why I want you to forgive me.
I' il pay my debt.
I know...... there are some things I' ve done, and to you.
Pay or go away.
Don' t you remember?
No, I don' t remember.
Why should I?
Nothing' s changed.
Say the truth.
If you want to save my soul...... this is where you' il find it.
You know that.
You' re the same as all the others, only you can' t admit it.
You' re pitiful.
I hate you.
Here' s my body.
Save it.
ls that the way you show you' re a man?
Turn away, don' t look at me.
You never had the courage to be a man.
Don' t look at me!
If you weren' t hanging on to your mother, you were hanging on to me.
Now you' re hanging on to God...... going to the desert to hide because you' re scared.
Go.
Whenever I see you, my heart breaks.
I do remember when we were children.
Never have I felt so much tenderness toward anyone...... as I felt toward you then.
All I ever wanted was you.
Nothing else.
What do you think I wanted?
Please.
Stay.
ls it so bad sharing a prostitute' s room?
I won' t touch you.
You' il still be a virgin for the desert.
Mary, I' m sorry.
I can' t stay.
Welcome.
This way.
Do you always pray this late at night?
It' s a funeral.
The master of the monastery died.
Shall I pray with you?
Sleep.
You must be tired.
I know who you are.
That was the man who brought me here last night.
Last night?
He was dead last night.
The master' s soul has gone to heaven.
His body' s work is completed.
It walked under the sun and the moon...... over sand and stone...... sinned, felt pain...... yearned for heaven.
We commend his remains to our God.
Flesh...... the master no longer needs you.
Melt away.
First came the wings, then the angel.
His spirit actually appeared to you.
He treated you like a royal visitor.
He recognized you for something.
He couldn' t have recognized me for anything.
I only came here to serve God.
That' s all.
That' s all God wants from me.
I' m sure of it.
Think of how you' re blessed.
God actually makes himself known to you.
I don' t know what God wants from me.
I' ve dedicated my life to him.
Sometimes...... I think I feel him, but I' m never really sure.
But you always know.
God took you by the hand and brought you here.
You think it' s a blessing to know what God wants?
I' il tell you what he wants.
He wants to push me over!
Can' t he see what' s inside of me?
All my sins.
- We all sin.
- Not my sins.
A hypocrite.
I don' t tell the truth.
I don' t have the courage.
When I see a woman, I blush and look away.
I want her, but I don' t take her, for God, and that makes me proud.
Then my pride ruins Magdalene.
I don' t steal, I don' t fight...... I don' t kill.
Not because I don' t want to, but because I' m afraid.
I want to rebel against you, against everything...... against God, but...... I' m afraid.
You want to know who my mother and father are?
You want to know who my God is?
Fear.
You look inside me and that' s all you' il find.
But the more devils we have inside of us, the more of a chance we have to repent.
Lucifer is inside me.
He says to me, "You' re not the son of King David.
"You' re not a man, you' re the Son of man.
"And more, the Son of God.
And more than that, God. "
Do you want to ask me anything else?
Everything is from God.
Everything has two meanings.
Jesus, my sweet Jesus.
I forgive you.
Leave me!
They' ve gone.
You have to leave, too.
- No, I have to stay.
- No.
You' ve been purified.
God has just blessed you.
The snakes came from inside you.
Now you have to leave, too.
You have to go back...... and speak to people and share your heart.
Speak to who?
To anyone who will listen.
And say what?
Just open your mouth.
Do you love mankind?
I see men and I feel sorry for them, that' s all.
That' s enough.
- I' ve got orders to kill you.
- Go ahead.
I can' t fight with God anymore.
Here' s my neck.
Cut it, I' m ready.
What are you?
What kind of a man are you?
What you want, I want.
That' s why he brought us together, it' s God' s plan.
I come to kill you and you help me, that' s God' s plan?
You' d better make me understand it, too.
I' il tell you as much as I know.
The fainting spells, the voices, the visions.
Power.
Magic.
ls there some secret?
Tell me your secret.
Pity.
Pity for who?
Yourself?
Pity for men.
Our enemies are men.
I feel pity for everything.
Donkeys...
-... grass, sparrows.
- And ants?
You feel pity for them, too?
Yes.
Everything' s a part of God.
When I see an ant, when I look at his shiny black eye...... you know what I see?
I see the face of God.
You' re not afraid of dying?
Why should I be?
Death isn' t a door that closes, it opens.
It opens and you go through it.
If I don' t kill you, what happens?
I' il speak to people.
What are you going to say?
I' il just open my mouth and God will do the talking.
Maybe God didn' t send you here to kill me.
Maybe he sent you here to follow me.
Just so there' s no mistake.
I' il go with you until I understand.
But if you stray this much...... from the path, I' il kill you.
It' s Magdalene.
She deserves it.
Get out of there.
Get out of the way!
This is not your business.
Do you want to get hurt?
- Did you hear what he said, idiot?
Move!
- No.
I don' t want this.
Listen to him.
He doesn' t want this.
Well, we want it.
- Why?
- We don' t have to tell you why!
I' ve had enough.
We live in a whorehouse.
She' s a Jew.
She works on the Sabbath.
She goes with Romans on the Sabbath.
She dies.
Who?
Which one of you people has never sinned?
Whoever that is, come up here!
And throw these!
I have nothing to hide.
Good.
Take this.
It' s bigger.
Be careful, Zebedee.
There is a God.
He' s seen you cheat your workers.
He' s seen you with that widow, what' s her name?
Judith.
Aren' t you afraid God will paralyze you if you lift that stone?
That your arm will wither?
That you' il lose all strength?
God has so many miracles.
What if I say the wrong thing?
What if I say the right thing?
Come closer.
Come closer!
We' re all a family.
Come closer, so you can hear.
I have something to tell you.
Who is he?
It' s Jesus from Nazareth.
Nothing good can come out of Nazareth, even the Scriptures say so.
... the easiest way to make myself clear...... is to tell you a story.
A farmer was planting in his field.
Some seed fell on the ground and the birds ate it.
Some seed fell on rocks and dried up.
But some seed....
Some seed fell on rich soil...... and grew into enough wheat to feed a whole nation.
Can you hear me?
We can hear you fine.
The farmer is me.
And 2 and 2 makes 4.
Another lunatic!
Rabbi...... tell me, if you' re the farmer...... and we' re the stones, what' s the seed?
What' s the seed?
Love.
That' s easy to say, maybe that' s good advice, but for some other world.
These people are starving.
First you feed them, then you talk!
I used to think God was angry, too, but not anymore!
He used to jump on me like a wild bird and dig his claws into my head.
But then one morning, he came to me.
He blew over me like a cool breeze and said, "Stand up."
And here I am.
And you will go to hell.
These are children' s stories.
How can they help us?
What are you hungry for?
What are you thirsty for?
For justice!
- And bread!
- Bread, too.
You' re thirsty for justice, for people to treat you fairly...... for people to treat you with respect.
What I' m telling you is...... whoever' s hungry for justice, they are the ones who' il be blessed.
They' il be filled with bread.
They' il never be hungry again.
They' lI have the real value, the value of love.
To love, share and comfort.
They' lI have the courage to do the good.
And you.
You' re mourning.
Mourners will be blessed.
You' lI have God to comfort you.
You won' t need men to do it.
And the meek.
They' re the ones who' il be blessed.
And the suffering, they' il be blessed, too.
And the peacemakers and the merciful...... and the sick, and the poor, and the outcasts...... you' il all be blessed because heaven is yours!
And believe me...
... believe me, those who are laughing now...... will be crying later.
Those whose stomachs are filled now will be hungry later.
And the rich will be poor forever!
Kill them!
I didn' t say death!
I said love!
I said love!
No, Father, I' m staying.
I need you!
- Come.
- I' m sorry, Father, I' m staying, too.
Not the two of you.
Come on!
Let me come with you, I can help.
Stay here.
You' il know when.
Tell people about me.
James.
Andrew.
Move over, John.
Move over, James.
I was just comfortable.
- Peter wants to lay down.
- Peter, there' s no more room.
I want to be by the fire.
Go over by Philip.
We' re all cold.
Shut up.
Rabbi, can I talk to you?
I' m not like these other men.
I mean, they' re good enough, they' re good men.
But they' re weak.
One' s worse than the other.
Where' d you find them?
Look at me.
If I love somebody, I would die for them.
If I hate somebody, I' d kill them.
I could even kill somebody I loved if they did the wrong thing.
Did you hear me?
Do you understand what I said?
Yes, I understand.
The other day you said, if a man hit you, you' d turn the other cheek.
I didn' t like that.
Only an angel could do that, or a dog.
I' m sorry but I' m neither.
I' m a free man.
I don' t turn my cheek to anyone.
We both want the same thing.
We do?
- Do you want freedom for lsrael?
- No.
I want freedom for the soul.
No.
That' s what I can' t accept.
That' s not the same thing!
First you free the body, then the spirit!
The Romans come first.
You don' t build a house from the roof down but from the foundation up.
- The foundation is the soul.
- The foundation is the body.
That' s where you must begin.
If you don' t change the spirit first, change what' s inside...... then you' il only replace the Romans with someone else, and nothing changes.
Even if you' re victorious, you' il still be filled with the poison.
You' ve got to break the chain of evil.
How do you change then?
With love.
- Who' s there?
- It' s me, Andrew.
ls everything....
It' s all right.
Go back to sleep.
Judas and I are talking.
There' s an example.
You know, the Zealots ordered me to kill you.
Why did you change your mind?
I decided to wait.
For what?
I thought maybe you were the One.
To unite us.
I didn' t want to destroy that.
How do we know?
How could I be the Messiah?
When those people were torturing Magdalene, I wanted to kill them.
And then I opened my mouth...... and out comes the word "love."
I don' t understand.
I can' t look to the others for answers, all they do is follow you.
We' il go to Judea and see John the Baptist.
Every day he tells hundreds of people the Messiah is coming.
He' il know.
He' il know.
I' m afraid.
Stay with me.
Behold!
I will raise up evil against you out of your own house...... and I will take your wives, before your eyes...... and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives...... in the sight of this sun.
You may listen and listen again...... but you will never understand.
You may look, but you will never know.
These people' s wits are dulled.
Their ears are deafened and their eyes blinded...... so they cannot see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears...... so that they may turn and be healed.
The Lord of Hosts says:
"On this day..."
He sounds like the Messiah.
No. "... I will crush the horns of the new moon and I will spill darkness over the world.
"I will reverse your laughter, turn it into tears...."
Go in front.
Let him see you.
"Listen, it is the thunder of many peoples...."
Even from behind, I knew I had seen him before.
Where?
Was it a dream?
Yes, it was.
But in the dream, he was dressed in white.
"You wilI have the smell of decay...
"... and branding, instead of beauty.
Your men shall fall by the sword... "... and your women shall sit on the ground, stripped bare."
Who are you?
Do you recognize me?
Who are you?
Do you know the Prophets?
What does lsaiah say?
He says, "Prepare the way of the Lord."
- Are you telling me that' s you?
- I don' t know.
Tell me.
Why are you here?
To be baptized.
No, I don' t dare.
If you' re the Master, then you have to baptize me.
Baptize me.
Love.
What does it mean?
Love is sweet as honey.
But it' s also blood.
Love is action.
You want a new crop, you burn the earth.
But isn' t love enough?
No!
Look at the world.
Look around you.
Plague, war, corruption...... false prophets, false idols, worship of gold.
Nothing is of value.
The tree is rotten.
You have to take the axe and cut it down.
If I was a woodcutter, I' d cut.
If I was a fire, I' d burn.
But I' m a heart and I love and that' s all I can do.
I' m a heart, also.
But I can' t love what' s unjust.
What I can' t love, I attack.
God demands it.
- Anger?
- Yes, God demands anger.
Anger?
But we' re all brothers.
You think love is God' s only way?
Go to the Dead Sea, look in the bottom.
You' lI see two whores, Sodom and Gomorrah.
That' s God' s way.
On the day of the Lord...... blood will flow from wood.
The stones of the houses will come alive and kill their owners.
That day is here.
He gave me the axe.
Now I give it to you.
That' s not the answer.
Then what is the answer?
I don' t know.
Well, if you won' t listen to me, who will you listen to?
God.
The God of lsrael is the God of the desert.
If you want to speak to him, then you' lI have to go to the desert.
I' il go to ldumaea.
Thank you, Baptist.
Be careful.
God isn' t alone out there.
I feel sorry for you.
You were lonely.
You cried.
So I came.
I didn' t call for you.
Who are you?
Your spirit.
My spirit?
You' re afraid of being alone.
You' re just like Adam.
He called me and I took one of his ribs...... and made it into a woman.
You' re here to trick me.
Trick you?
To love and care for a woman, to have a family, is this a trick?
Why are you trying to save the world?
Aren' t your own sins enough for you?
What arrogance to think you can save the world.
The world doesn' t have to be saved.
Save yourself.
Find love.
I have love.
Look...... in my eyes.
Look at my breasts.
Do you recognize them?
Just nod your head...... and we' il be in my bed together.
After ten days...... the hunger went away.
Welcome, Jesus.
Congratulations.
You' re past the small temptations of a woman and a family.
We' re both bigger than that.
- Who are you?
- You don' t recognize me?
I' m you, I' m your heart.
Your heart is so greedy.
It pretends to be humble...... but it really wants to conquer the world.
I never wanted a kingdom on earth.
- The kingdom of heaven is enough.
- You' re a liar.
When you were making crosses for the Romans...... your head was exploding with dreams ofpower.
Power over everyone.
You said it was God, but you really wanted power.
Now you can have what you want.
Any country you want.
All of them.
- You could even have Rome.
- Liar.
Step into my circle so I can pull your tongue out.
Archangel, move back.
Move back, you' re blinding me.
I' m the one you' ve been waiting for.
Remember...... when you were a little boy...... you cried..
"Make me a god, God.
"God.
"God, make me a god."
But I was just a child then.
You are God.
The Baptist knew it.
Now it' s time you admit it.
You are his son.
The only Son of God.
Join me.
Together we' il rule the living and the dead.
You' il give life and you' il take life.
You' il sit in judgement, and I' il sit next to you.
Imagine how strong we' d be together.
We' lI see each other again.
Don' t be afraid.
You are the One.
My work is done.
Now I can die.
The Lord wants me to tell you to stand up.
His day is here.
Take this axe.
Take this message to everyone.
Please.
What do you want?
I' m a foreigner.
From Galilee.
I' m tired.
You don' t know how good this tastes.
Some more wine, please.
Mary...... Martha...... I want to say that you' re both blessed.
I came here, you didn' t know me.
You took me in, fed me, restored me...... and God came down and went into my heart.
- No.
I' ve talked too much already.
Silence is better.
No, it' s not.
Do you have a wife?
No.
How can you live like that in the desert?
Tell me the truth.
Don' t you miss all this?
Having a home, a real life.
I admit it.
I' d like it, but I' il never have it.
Listen, if you really want God, don' t spend your time in the desert.
He' s not there, he' s right here.
He wants you to make children.
Mary, you' re making him uncomfortable.
He knows what I' m talking about.
Come and help me.
It' s not right to tease these men.
I wasn' t teasing.
Remember the Baptist?
It' s nothing to tease about.
You didn' t know?
They say the king was drunk and cut off the Baptist' s head to satisfy him.
Now they say they' re going to kill everyone who was baptized.
No one forced you to be baptized.
You were baptized, too.
You begged for it.
So be quiet.
I can just imagine in Galilee right now.
The sea.
They say the fishing' s so good you just touch the nets and the fish jump in.
Don' t talk about fish.
It reminds me of my sheep.
I don' t know what' s happened to them.
Maybe we should wait for him in Galilee.
No, we promised the Master we would wait here.
That was over a month ago.
Thousands of people are waiting to see and to hear him and he' s gone.
The whole movement.
We look like fools.
Nathaniel' s right.
He makes sense.
Let' s return to Galilee.
If we go back to Galilee, like Peter says --
Brothers!
I don' t understand you.
Think of the last words the Baptist said.
He said, "Jesus of Nazareth, leave the desert.
"You return to mankind."
How do we know he really said that?
- Everybody says he did.
- But how do we know?
- Even if he didn' t, the words are important.
- Why?
Because people believe them.
And what if our Master' s....
What if he' s the One?
What "One"?
- The One.
- What do you mean?
The Messiah?
We don' t know the Baptist said that.
Nobody knows.
He' s not like Elijah.
He' s saying that the world of God is here now.
He just meant, "Continue my work.
"Continue to do the work I' ve been doing."
Right here Elijah ascended to heaven.
Doesn' t that mean something to you?
We' re waiting here.
We' re waiting here.
I don' t think we should go back to Galilee.
I think we should wait here.
That' s what I love about you, Peter.
You' re as steady and as solid as a rock.
Nobody can change your mind.
What good are you?
Master.
Rabbi.
John heard your footsteps in his heart...... in a way, and we were preparing to welcome you.
Were you baptized?
Yes.
John baptized with water and they killed him.
Now I baptize with fire.
ls that what the Baptist told you?
I have an invitation for you.
ls there a celebration?
No.
I' m not inviting you to a celebration.
I' m inviting you to a war.
This is my heart.
Take it.
God is inside of us.
The devil is outside us, in the world all around us.
We' il pick up an axe and cut the devil' s throat.
We' il fight him wherever he is.
In the sick...... in the rich...... even in the temple.
I' il lead you.
If you have sheep...... give them away.
If you have a family...... leave them.
I believed in love.
Now I believe in this!
Who' s with me?
Today and tomorrow I cast out devils and work cures.
On the third day...... I shall be perfected.
Out!
Satan, leave!
Satan, out!
Leave him!
Moses, Elijah, lsaiah...... touch my mouth...... touch my lips.
Go to the temple.
Let the high priests see you.
Look!
He was blind and Jesus healed him.
Look.
He was blind and Jesus healed him.
Look.
You don' t belong at a wedding.
We' re here to celebrate purity.
I' m sorry, but these people are my guests.
Let me explain something to you.
What do you think heaven' s like?
It' s like a wedding.
God' s the bridegroom and man' s spirit' s the bride.
The wedding takes place in heaven...... and everyone' s invited.
God' s world is big enough for everyone.
Nazarene, that' s against the law.
Then the law' s against my heart.
Don' t touch me.
You are now sacred to me...... through this ring.
"You are now sacred to me, through this ring."
According to the law of Moses and lsrael.
"According to the law of Moses and lsrael."
My cousins are very upset.
They only brought enough wine for 3 days.
Now another day' s gone past and it' s gone.
What' s in those?
- Water.
- No.
It' s wine.
No, it' s water.
I put it there myself.
- It' s wine.
- It' s water.
Go over there and make sure.
Do it.
You' re right.
It is wine.
Brothers!
My old friends!
Listen to me.
It' s me the Prophets preached about.
God talked to me in the desert.
He gave me a secret and told me to bring it to you.
Didn' t you hear me coming?
I ran here to Nazareth, where I grew up, to bring you the news.
The world of God is here now.
You work miracles.
Make us believe in you.
Otherwise go away.
The Messiah doesn' t need miracles.
He is the miracle.
Now he' s here.
Are you ready for me?
I' m here to tear down everything around you.
You know what I' il replace it with?
Something new.
God.
The world of God.
So take your bread and give it to the poor.
What difference does it make what you own?
You have gold and silver.
It' s going to rot.
That rot is going to eat away your hearts.
All of you!
But there will be a new ark riding on that fire!
And I hold the keys and I open the door.
And I decide who goes in and who doesn' t.
You' re my brothers from Nazareth and you' re the first I invite on the ark.
Don' t wait.
Don' t waste your life.
Come with me.
You' re the son of Mary, right?
Who are you to tell us about God?
He made better crosses than speeches.
Go get someone from his family to take him away.
He' s insane.
What are you laughing at?
Everything you have will burn.
Get out now!
Come with me to Jerusalem!
See?
This is what happens when a man doesn' t get married.
The semen backs up into his brain.
Go home!
You' re possessed.
You' re a lunatic!
This is my home!
- You should be ashamed.
He' s going to burn us.
Don' t touch him!
If I could touch every stone...... if I could breathe on every branch, they' d get up and follow me!
So what' s wrong with you?
Come with me to Jerusalem!
I feel it.
I know it.
You see these people?
They' re poor.
They' re blind.
They' re crippled.
They' re going to be our army.
We' re going to need better men than this.
God will give them to me.
We' re going to build a new Jerusalem.
Son.
Come back with me.
Please.
Who are you?
- Your mother.
- I don' t have a mother.
I don' t have any family.
I have a Father, in heaven.
Don' t say that to me.
Who are you?
I mean, really.
Who are you?
Why are you crying?
Didn' t you see them?
What?
When he spoke to you, there were thousands of blue wings behind him.
I swear to you, Mary, there were armies of angels.
- There were?
- Thousands.
I' d be happier if there weren' t.
When was he buried?
Three days ago.
Roll away the stone.
In the name of the Prophets...... in the name of Jeremiah and my Father...... in the name of the most holy God...... I call you here.
I call you here!
God, help me.
We came here to pray.
Look at this.
The money- changers?
It' s for the temple tax, for the feast.
I know.
How' s the exchange today?
Fair.
At this stall it' s always fair.
Making a good profit?
Fair.
This is my Father' s house!
It is a place of worship...... not a market!
Nazarene, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
God doesn' t need a palace.
He doesn' t need cypress trees or dead animals!
He doesn' t need shekels!
You expect people to pay the tax with Roman coins.
They have images of false gods on them!
You want pagan gods in the temple?
All foreign coins have to be exchanged for shekels.
That is the law.
I have a new law and a new hope.
What?
Has God changed his mind about the old law?
No.
He just thinks our hearts are ready to hold more, that' s all.
How can you presume --
I' m the end of the old law and the beginning of the new one.
- Watch what you' re saying.
- Maybe we should go.
When I say, "I," Rabbi...... I' m saying "God."
That' s blasphemy.
Didn' t they tell you?
I' m the saint of blasphemy.
Don' t make any mistakes.
I came to bring a sword.
Talking like that will get you killed.
Me killed?
Listen to me.
This temple will be destroyed in three days.
Torn down to the ground!
There won' t be one stone left to build with!
You think God belongs only to you?
He doesn' t.
God' s an immortal spirit who belongs to everybody...... to the whole world!
You think you' re special?
God is not an lsraelite!
Magician, heal me.
Cure us.
Make us rich.
Heal me!
Do a miracle.
You want me to enter the world of God crippled like this?
Don' t touch me!
You' re filled with hate!
Get away!
God won' t help you.
You cure us, or you won' t leave this city alive.
You don' t make demands on God!
Judas!
What are you doing with this magician?
You had orders to kill him and you haven' t done it.
Now he acts like a prophet and you follow him.
Did you hear what he said back there, Saul?
Yes, I heard him.
We took an oath against Rome.
I don' t see anything against Rome here.
All I see are Jews against Jews.
Then you' re not listening.
How do you feel?
I like the light.
What was it like?
Which is better, death or life?
I was a little surprised.
There wasn' t that much difference.
Give me your hand.
I' m not surprised.
How could they let Lazarus live?
He was proof of your greatest miracle.
Now there' s no more proof.
That' s what the Zealots want.
Their revolution, not yours.
You want to go back to them?
No.
You' re the one I follow.
You are the strongest, aren' t you?
Of all my friends...... you' re the strongest.
Judas, my brother...... I' ve something to tell you.
I have a terrible secret from God.
- You know why I came to Jerusalem?
- Yes.
This is where the revolution is going to begin.
Last night lsaiah came to me.
He had a prophecy.
I saw it written.
It said..
"He has borne our faults..."... he was wounded for our transgressions...
"Despised and rejected by all...
"... he went forward without resisting, like a lamb led to the slaughter."
I don' t understand.
Judas, I am the lamb.
I' m the one who' s going to die.
Die?
- You mean you' re not the Messiah?
- I am.
That can' t be.
If you' re the Messiah, why do you have to die?
At first, I didn' t understand -- - No, you, listen!
Every day you have a different plan!
First it' s love, then it' s the axe, and now you have to die.
- What good could that do?
- I can' t help it.
God only talks to me a little at a time.
He tells me as much as I need to know.
- We need you alive!
- Now I finally understand.
All my life I' ve been followed...... by voices...... by footsteps...... by shadows.
And do you know what the shadow is?
The cross.
I have to die on the cross and I have to die willingly.
We have to go back to the temple.
After you die on the cross, what happens then?
I come back to judge the living and the dead.
I don' t believe you.
You have to.
I' m worried he' s going to change his mind again.
No, he won' t.
This time we' re not going to the temple to pray.
He said he' il destroy the temple in three days, and he' il do it.
And what if he doesn' t?
- What then?
- What if he doesn' t?
You won' t have to worry because we' il all be dead.
We' re setting up a new government, building a new Jerusalem.
We can ask for anything we want.
First, I' d like more sheep.
You know, my other sheep, I don' t even know where they are now.
This time I want a large herd, and I' il get other shepherds to care for them.
I would just like to be able to worship in the temple.
I mean really worship, without Roman banners and soldiers.
Of course.
But what else?
I' il do anything the Master asks, anything but get crucified.
- You' re a coward, Thomas.
- Yes, I am.
You know why?
Have you ever seen anyone on a cross after two days?
You know what they look like?
They don' t even have eyes.
The crows come and suck out your eyes.
And after that, you know what?
Dogs come and rip your feet off.
Don' t talk that way.
I' ve made my decision.
You make yours.
And if you can' t, then get out now before we get to Jerusalem.
I have my knife.
Some of them wanted me to ask you:
Will there be angels there to meet us?
Or anyone besides who' s here?
Master.
King of the Jews!
King of the Jews!
Jesus!
Lord, I hope this is what you want.
Let me die here.
Please let it happen fast while I have the strength.
I am here to set fire to the world.
In the desert, the Baptist warned us, God is coming.
Well, I' m telling you it' s too late.
He' s already here.
I' m here.
I' m going to baptize everybody with fire!
He' s leading us!
Follow him!
They' re all with you, waiting for your signal.
Give it!
Now!
Do it now!
Please!
I' m waiting, too.
Give me an axe, not the cross.
Let me die like this.
Give the sign now or we' re finished.
- They' il kill us -- - We came to fight, not to die!
Master, we knew it would be like this.
This is the way.
Do it.
Judas, help me!
Stay with me.
Don' t leave me.
I wish there was another way.
I' m sorry, but there isn' t.
I have to die on the cross.
I won' t let you die.
You have no choice, neither do I.
Remember, we' re bringing God and man together.
I' m the sacrifice.
Without you, there can be no redemption.
Forget everything else.
Understand that.
No, I can' t.
Get somebody stronger.
You promised me.
Remember?
Yes.
I' ve strayed, haven' t I?
Yes.
Then you must keep your promise.
You have to kill me.
If that' s what God wants, let God do it.
I won' t.
He will do it through you.
The temple guards will be looking for me where there aren' t any crowds.
We' il go to Gethsemane.
You' il make sure that they find me there.
I am going to die.
But after three days...... I' il come back, in victory.
You can' t leave me.
You have to give me strength.
If you were me, could you betray your master?
No.
That' s why God gave me the easier job...... to be crucified.
What about the others?
I' il tell them tonight.
Listen to me.
Take this bread.
Share it together.
This bread is my body.
Now drink this wine.
Pass the cup.
This wine is my blood.
Do this to remember me.
We' re not finished.
Let him go.
All of you...... I want to tell you something.
Wait for me here.
Father in heaven.
Father on earth.
The world...... that you' ve created, that we can see, is beautiful.
But the world you' ve created, that we can' t see, is beautiful, too.
I' m sorry, Father.
I don' t know which is more beautiful.
This is my body, too.
Together...... we' re going to die.
Please, Father.
I' ve been with you for so long.
I never asked you to choose me.
I always did as you said.
You made many miracles for others.
You opened the Red Sea for Moses.
You saved Noah.
You took Elijah to heaven in a fiery chariot...... and now you' re asking me to be crucified.
Can I ask you...... one last time?
ls there any other way?
You' re offering me a cup, but I don' t want to drink what' s in it.
Please, take it away.
Please, stop.
Please, Father.
Please.
ls this your answer?
All right.
Just please give me the strength.
Couldn' t you stay awake with me for just an hour?
I' m sorry.
It doesn' t matter.
It' s too late.
Welcome, Rabbi.
No.
You live by this, you die by it.
Take me with you.
I' m ready.
So, you are the King of the Jews?
"King" is your word.
Well, you are Jesus of Nazareth, aren' t you?
Yes, I am.
That' s what they' re saying you are.
The King, the Messiah.
It' s also said that you do miracles.
ls this good magic or bad magic?
Could we have some kind of a demonstration?
I mean, can you do a trick for me, now?
No, I' m not a trained animal.
I' m not a magician.
That' s disappointing.
This means that you' re just another Jewish politician.
Do you want to know something?
You' re more dangerous than the Zealots.
Do you know that?
Say something.
You had better say something.
All right.
Tell me what you tell people on the streets.
- Yes.
The prophet DanieI had a vision:
A tall statue that had a gold head and silver shoulders.
The stomach was bronze, the legs were iron, the feet were clay.
A stone was thrown.
The clay feet broke and the statue collapsed.
You see, God threw the stone.
And Rome --
And Rome is the statue, yes.
So your kingdom, or your world, will replace Rome.
Where is it?
My kingdom?
It' s not here.
Not on earth.
It wouldn' t be, would it?
It' s one thing to want to change the way that people live...... but you want to change how they think, how they feel.
All I' m saying is that change will happen with love, not with killing.
Either way, it' s dangerous.
It' s against Rome.
It' s against the way the world is.
And killing or loving, it' s all the same.
It simply doesn' t matter how you want to change things.
We don' t want them changed.
You do understand what has to happen?
We have a space for you up on Golgotha.
Three thousand skulls there by now.
Probably more.
Guard.
I do wish you people would go out and count them some time.
Maybe you' d learn a lesson.
Probably not.
I saw you with him.
You must be mistaken.
It wasn' t me.
It must have been someone else.
No, I' m right.
He is one of his followers.
- He doesn' t know what he' s talking about.
- He is one of his followers.
It' s him!
Get him!
Mother?
Magdalene?
Where are you?
Mother, I' m sorry for being a bad son.
Father, stay with me.
Don' t leave me.
Father, forgive them.
Father!
Why have you forsaken me?
Who are you?
I' m the angel who guards you.
Your Father is the God of mercy, not punishment.
He saw you and said, "Aren' t you his guardian angel?
"Well, go down and save him.
He' s suffered enough. "
Remember when he told Abraham to sacrifice his son?
Abraham was just about to kill the boy with his knife when God stopped him.
So, if he saved Abraham' s son, don' t you think he' d want to save his own?
He' s tested you and he' s happy with you.
He doesn' t want your blood.
He said, "Let him die in a dream.
But let him live his life. "
All the pain.
That was real.
Yes, but there won' t be any more.
You' ve done enough.
I don' t have to be sacrificed?
No, you don' t.
I' m not the Messiah?
No, you' re not.
What about the others?
Don' t look back there.
God gave you life.
Look ahead.
Where are the disciples?
They became frightened and ran away.
ls this the world of God?
The one I spoke about?
No, this is earth.
Why has it changed so much?
You have.
Now you can see its real beauty.
Harmony between earth and the heart, that' s the world of God.
Maybe you' il find this hard to believe...... but sometimes we angels look down on men and envy you.
Really envy you.
What' s that?
A wedding ceremony.
Who' s getting married?
You are.
What' s wrong?
Why are you crying?
I' m thanking God...... for bringing you here.
We could have a child.
We could have a child.
Where are you going?
Who are you going to kill?
Are you going to kill God?
Didn' t you hear me, Jesus?
There is nothing you can do.
God' s killed her.
God' s killed her.
God took her away when she was happy.
Now she' s immortal.
She won' t see her love die or body decay.
I was there the whole time he was killing her and saw what happened.
But it wasn' t right.
It wasn' t right for God to take her.
You didn' t complain when God let you live.
You can' t complain now because he let her die.
Trust God' s way.
Listen.
There' s only one woman in the world.
One woman with many faces.
This one falls, the next one rises.
Mary Magdalene died...... but Mary, Lazarus' s sister...... she lives.
She' s Magdalene with a different face.
She' s carrying your greatest joy inside her.
Your son.
Come with me.
This is the way the Savior comes.
Gradually, from embrace to embrace.
From son to son.
This is the road.
I understand.
Mary.
Look.
Rabbi, I just want to see if it' s really you.
He' s real, like us.
Don' t you see?
Come in.
Come here.
Master, I want to tell you one thing.
I won' t ever leave you alone again.
I' il always protect you.
I don' t want you to take the wrong road and get lost again.
I' il cook for you and your friend.
Are you satisfied with me?
Do you have any complaints?
None.
I' m ashamed when I think of it.
Of what?
Of all the mistakes I' ve made.
Of all the wrong ways I looked for God.
Where' s Mary?
She won' t be back till this evening.
Come inside.
It' s too hot out here.
Come inside.
There' s only one woman in the world.
Go inside.
We don' t have to get involved.
Come on, stay out of it.
Here, watch your brother.
Remember to thank God for the food and leave some for me.
I' il be back soon.
- Aren' t you going to eat?
- I want to hear what he says.
You don' t have to go there.
I lied, I stole, I cheated...... I gambled, I whored, I drank and persecuted, tortured and murdered.
Yes, murdered!
I killed anyone who broke the law of Moses.
And I loved it, I enjoyed it, I relished it, I reveled in it.
Because I thought I was doing God' s will.
I thought I was doing God' s will.
And the high priest of Jerusalem sent me to Damascus to scourge that city.
And on the road to Damascus, just outside the city, in the middle of the day...... I was struck by a white light that blinded me!
Yes.
And I heard a voice say:
"Saul, why are you persecuting me?
"Why are you against me?"
"Who are you?" I said.
And the voice said:
"Jesus."
And he...... made me see.
I was led helpless like a child, into a city that I was sent to scourge.
And God sent me Ananias instead...... and he put his hands on me and I opened my eyes...... and I was baptized and became Paul.
And now I bring the good news to you.
It' s about Jesus of Nazareth.
He was not the son of Mary.
He was the Son of God.
His mother was a virgin.
And the angel Gabriel came down and put God' s seed in her womb.
That' s how he was born.
And he was punished for our sins.
Then he was tortured and crucified.
But three days later he rose up from the dead...... and went up to heaven.
Death was conquered!
Do you understand what that means?
He conquered death.
All of our sins were forgiven...... and now the world of God is open to every one of us.
To everybody!
Did you ever see this Jesus of Nazareth after he came back from the dead?
I mean, with your own eyes?
No, but I saw a light that blinded me and I heard his voice.
- You' re a liar.
- His disciples saw him.
They were hiding in an attic, the doors locked, and he appeared to them.
Liar.
He' s a liar!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I want to talk to you.
I' m a man.
Quiet!
Why are you telling these lies?
What are you talking about?
I' m the son of Mary and Joseph.
I' m the one who preached in Galilee.
I had followers, we marched on Jerusalem.
Pilate condemned me and God saved me.
No, he didn' t.
Who are you talking about?
Don' t try to tell me what happened, because I know.
I live like a man now.
I work, eat, have children.
I enjoy my life.
For the first time, I' m enjoying it.
Do you understand me?
So don' t go around telling lies about me, or I' il tell everybody the truth!
Wait just a minute.
What' s the matter with you?
Look around you.
Look at all these people.
Look at their faces.
Do you see how unhappy they are?
Do you see how they' re suffering?
Their only hope is the resurrected Jesus.
I don' t care whether you' re Jesus or not.
The resurrected Jesus will save the world and that' s what matters.
Those are lies.
You can' t save the world by lying.
I created the truth out of what people needed and what they believed.
If I have to crucify you to save the world, then I' il crucify you.
I won' t let you.
I' il tell everyone the truth.
Go ahead.
Tell them now.
Who' s going to believe you?
You started all this, now you can' t stop it.
All those people who believe me will kill you.
- No.
That wouldn' t happen.
- How do you know?
You see, you don' t know how much people need God.
You don' t know how happy he can make them.
Happy to do anything.
He can make them happy to die and they' il die.
All for the sake of Christ.
Jesus of Nazareth.
The Son of God.
The Messiah.
Not you.
Not for your sake.
You know, I' m glad I met you.
Because now I can forget all about you.
My Jesus is much more important and much more powerful.
Thank you.
It' s a good thing I met you.
Don' t ever leave me.
I' m happy here.
I remember when Mary and I planted these vines.
You know, this will all pass.
Why?
Are you leaving me?
We have to move on.
You' ve grown old.
You' ve done well.
We' ve both done well.
Get inside.
Get inside, fast!
Jerusalem is on fire!
The Romans are killing everyone.
Move out of the way.
We were sent here.
God told us you would show yourself to us.
He said you were dying.
Peter? ls that you?
I can' t tell.
What happened to you?
I got old.
You got old.
This one I know.
No matter how old you get, I know you, Nathaniel.
You were the best shepherd because you had no sheep.
I missed you.
And you?
They cut you.
Your face.
Who are you?
John.
The Romans tortured me, cut my face.
I tried to tell them all about you.
Then I saw Jerusalem burn.
I even saw the Ark of the Covenant stolen from the temple.
They destroyed the temple, just like you said.
The Ark?
There' s someone else outside.
Be careful.
He' s still angry.
Judas, come in.
Didn' t you hear me?
I missed you so much.
He hears you.
He just won' t say anything.
He' s been fighting in Jerusalem.
Look at his hands.
There' s still blood on them.
Judas, the Master is speaking to you.
Answer him.
Traitor!
Your place was on the cross.
That' s where God put you.
When death got too close, you got scared and you ran away...... and you hid yourself in the life of some man.
We did what we were supposed to do!
You didn' t!
You' re a coward!
Don' t you have any respect?
For him?
You don' t understand.
Understand?
You broke my heart.
Sometimes I curse the day I ever met you.
We held the world in our hands.
Remember what you told me?
You took me in your arms.
Do you remember?
And you begged me, "Betray me, betray me.
"I have to be crucified.
"I have to be resurrected so I can save the world.
"I am the lamb," you said.
"Death is the door.
"Judas, my brother, don' t be afraid.
Help me go through the door. "
And I loved you so much.
I went and betrayed you.
And you...
... you....
What are you doing here?
What business do you have here with women, with children?
What' s good for man isn' t good for God.
Why weren' t you crucified?
Look at his wounds, Judas.
They' re bleeding.
You' re hurting him.
That' s enough.
He was going to be the New Covenant.
Now there' s no more lsrael.
No, you don' t understand.
The guardian angel.
God sent a guardian angel to save me.
What angel?
Look at her.
I told you we would meet again.
If you die this way, you die like a man.
You turned against God, your Father.
There' s no sacrifice.
There' s no salvation.
There' s nothing you can do.
You lived this life.
It' s over now.
You just finish it and die.
Die like a man.
Father.
Will you listen to me?
Are you still there?
Will you listen to a selfish, unfaithful son?
I fought you when you called.
I resisted.
I didn' t want to be your son.
Can you forgive me?
I didn' t fight hard enough.
Father...... give me your hand.
I want to bring salvation!
Father, take me back!
Make a feast!
I want to be your son!
I want to pay the price!
I want to be crucified and rise again!
I want to be the Messiah!
It is accomplished!
It is accomplished.
THE RULES OF THE GAME
A film analysis by Jean Douchet and Pierre Oscar Lévy
Jean Renoir starts shooting "The Rules of the Game",
tensions in Europe are at their peak.
General Franco has just captured Barcelona.
The Spanish republic is defeated.
The Western democracies give in once again.
Renoir wishes to direct a film not related to these events.
"The Rules of the Game" is a frivolous comedy in the French stage tradition.
But the comedy turns to causticity and Jean Renoir shows the cause of the evil eating away at Europe.
He depicts a class that shuns its responsibilities, a society locked in sterile games, a ruling class whose blindness paves the way for fascism.
The film becomes the testimony to the world tragedy that lies ahead.
The massacre taking place during the hunting scene is a warning.
"I wanted to show a society that is dancing on a volcano", said Renoir.
They are also unpredictable.
On hindsight, they turn out to be obnoxious.
Their pleasures are cruel and futile.
As a group, they become murderers.
Trapped by the rules, they act without desire and react like robots.
Renoir creates a movement that shows each character at close range then at a greater distance.
He shows first their intimacy then the reality of their social game.
For this purpose he uses the fielddepth and a wide angle shot, as the visual and sound range is covered three- dimensionally.
He describes how complex life is.
"The Rules of the Game" is a masterpiece,
a lesson in movie- making.
ln the end, all is well again.
After Jurieu' s death, shot like a rabbit, no one is shocked.
His death is covered up like in a conjuring trick.
Through their lies they recover good manners, the comedy has lasted long enough.
The violence of this society has been proven.
Death is accepted as a necessity, not a coincidence, in order for the rules to apply.
The landowners are together again.
But having respected the etiquette and saved appearances for so long, this class condemns itself.
Lifeless, it is heading for its own downfall.
Renoir shows this by having mere shadows returning to the castle.
The movie ends at night with a fade to black.
The rules allowed to eliminate the intruders.
The troublemakers leave as they came.
Jurieu, the pilot, a modern hero, is greeted with lies.
He disappears in hypocrisy.
Octave, the faithful friend, the sponger, steps aside like a servant.
Marceau, the poacher, is fired...
... in the same way he was hired.
life itself: desire, love and fiction.
But in this world, they must be marginalized.
There is no room for them.
"The Rules of the Game" is the story of their brief passage on a stage run by the Marquis.
For the viewer, it is also the story of the games of love and desire.
The women believe they are at the heart of the story.
The men gravitate around them as if women were the reason for the movement.
The bourgeois comedy follows the traditions of light French comedies.
The three classical characters, husband, wife, lover move under the conniving gaze of the husband, the Marquis, master of the entire social mechanism.
He reigns over a society of robots.
"The Rules of the Game" starts out as a comedy and ends in tragedy.
Renoir, in a skillfully unbalanced movement, switches from one to the other.
Thus he draws the movie' s dynamics from its construction that is rigorous and flawless.
ln the first reel, Renoir deals out the cards.
The suitor, the wife, the husband, the mistress.
They position themselves for the eternal game of love.
ln the second reel, Octave wants to be the matchmaker.
Each reel is a step in the plot.
Between each reel, there is a fade out.
ln the third reel, the action started in Paris continues as we discover La Colinière
and a new intruder.
ln the fourth reel, the guests arrive.
ln the fifth, everything works out.
The entire sixth reel deals with the hunt.
Whatever you are seeing over there seems interesting.
Very interesting.
Suddenly Christine understands.
The seventh reel heralds the falling apart of the couples.
You see, you are bothering us!
At the beginning of the eighth reel, the film' s structure changes completely.
The second part of the story develops in the next four reels.
There no longer are any fade outs, ellipses or dissolves.
The game is shattered.
ln one evening, we follow the characters' crazy race as if they were in a play.
This grand finale is heralded at the beginning of the film by a reference to the "Marriage of Figaro".
As in the theatre, the action of the first part unfolds in continuity.
Yet Renoir uses fade to black and three dissolves.
These ellipses are like a curtain that rises and falls on stage.
As in the theatre, the unity of place is important.
The film unfolds behind closed doors.
The townhouse in Paris,
the hunting grounds in Sologne and the castle of La Colinière are but one space belonging to one person, the Marquis.
As on stage, the leading characters have their stand- ins, their manservants,
who experience the same situations as their masters.
But their actions are more natural and more violent.
They show the owner' s true self and act on his behalf.
Renoir however is not filming a play.
As if he were making a documentary, he tries to recreate the rhetoric of news reporting.
The film starts with a live radio news coverage.
Renoir uses these modern techniques to introduce his subject concisely and efficiently.
The classical voice- over which often starts a fiction is embodied by the newscaster.
It seems more natural.
The radio pulls the thread of the narrative.
It switches from one character to the next, from one setting to the next, efficiently and quickly.
Each character' s motivations and plans are immediately known.
And first of all those of Renoir, the director.
He uses these recreated newsreels to make us believe in the reality of the plot.
The director shows an episode of modern life and announces the logic in the making of his film.
The event takes place.
The newscaster and the camera disappear.
The plane suddenly appears,
life' s speed and power.
Life enters the shot and disrupts it in an utter confusion of frames and sounds.
Enthusiasm arises in this news coverage meant to be well polished.
From then on, the camera stands back in order to become independent and have another viewpoint.
The movie' s dynamics always switch between these viewpoints.
A close shot of the subject is followed by a backward movement setting it in its context.
This near- to- far movement from the general to the particular is characteristic of the movie.
It shows characters under a pleasant light to reveal their lie when they think they are being sincere.
Renoir' s moviemaking technique serves a specific idea: to describe the lies of a society that no longer believes in its own values.
This class is so powerful it can make nature lie.
Even the beats are solely organized for conventional purposes.
ln a documentary- like sequence, Renoir meticulously follows the ritual of bourgeois hunts'.
Life' s tremor and slow death throes contrast with the cold conduct of the hunters.
The editing rhythm, the well- designed framing and the sharp directing contribute to a rigorous story- telling.
To film the life and the death of the animal the camera must capture the action as in a newsreel.
Precisely organized and well- designed frames surround the hunters.
The hides and the trees push us towards the game as the hunters shoot at us but disappear when we see the hunters' backs.
Renoir puts up the fences the Marquis hates.
We too are excluded from this world.
A curtain of trees separates us from the action.
Renoir shows the power of this class to which the beaters conveniently offer this massacre.
The Marquis occupies his space as if he ruled the world and even owned nature itself.
Renoir organizes the sequence around the crossing of his shots whose techniques and aspects differ.
The movie is not a filmed play nor a true story report.
ln "The Rules of the Game", all narrative styles are combined to create dynamics that remain lively.
The free style in writing provides a feeling of burgeoning, an impression of energy, as if the film were unfolding in the present.
François Truffaut wrote:
"Each viewer feels he is participating
"in the shooting of the movie.
"Renoir seems to be organizing everything
"as the movie is being shown.
"You almost feel like saying that you will come back tomorrow to see if the story is the same."
Renoir, who plays Octave in the movie, seems to be directing the movie from within his character and within the frame itself.
Here, he watches her as she focuses the binoculars.
Here again, he wants to change the script.
Everywhere, he tries to inspire freedom and life.
Until Renoir the actor, overcome by the forces he has set in motion...
... is thrown out of the production by Renoir the "auteur".
Here the plot twists around.
The freedom, the vitality and the energy of the game are most obvious.
Octave is no match for the unsettled social mechanisms.
Society itself, a society of ghosts, is carried along by its death urges.
Once again, Renoir uses and combines all styles.
ln this amateur theatre or cabaret skit, death dances as in a medieval mystery play.
Here partners change and doors slam as in light comedy.
A light comedy.
A social satire.
Or a moralistic comedy.
The different styles mix without affecting the work' s unity.
Renoir places side by side scenes with contrasting styles as a painter would do with complementary colors to give them more sparkle.
Each actor plays his own role with his own technique.
Each is from a different school and has his own acting style.
Each acts freely, according to his own personality.
Nobody is surprised to hear a poacher in Sologne talk with a Parisian accent.
Renoir lets Dalio use too much make- up when he must reveal the vanity and falsehood of the Marquis.
Like the fashionable photographers of the day, the lighting embellishes the women' s faces in close- ups.
Christine,
Lisette,
Geneviève.
Renoir imposes the photography which the situation requires.
And it changes depending on the action, on the requirements of a scene and on the style of the shot.
Renoir uses all the known technical processes to get to the truth.
His camera opens the doors into a world of strict rules, yet his directing seems to leave the actors totally free.
They remain lively, direct and at ease, not technically hindered.
Yet this seeming freedom in the directing hides the reality.
They are on probation so to speak.
The camera is always there, precise and meaningful.
Whatever they think or do, they cannot escape it.
It is always between two French window panes, a frame within the frame, that we enter this world.
Renoir uses a long continuous sequence with sufficient depth to see the action unfold near as well as far from the camera.
The camera follows the characters attentively and rigorously.
Robert disappears from the shot when Christine calls.
The Marquis must ask permission to be admitted within the frame.
After some noise, the camera suddenly searches for Lisette.
The moving frame gives true meaning to the relationships between the characters.
The Marquis goes on his way.
Christine prefers to welcome Octave and kisses him like a friend.
Robert kisses his wife' s hand as in high society.
To underline the husband and wife' s formal relationship, the miles separating Schumacher from Lisette are mentioned.
The camera thus moves in an abrupt blur pan with a truck- in forward.
A move that alerts the viewer.
The truck- in with a pan towards the left underlines Octave' s energy and at the same time describes how cold the relationship is between the Marquis and his wife.
The pan and the side truck tell the truth.
The Marquis and Christine' s relationship is strictly social.
The pan is the major camera movement in this movie.
It favors the width of the field, over the depth which underlines the legible actions, near and far from the camera.
Therefore the pan together with the field depth allow Renoir to give his directing as much freedom, speed and life as possible in the most complex situation.
Field depth, pan, speed.
Then it pans and is still again.
lrruption of sounds, confusion in the situation.
The camera remains still during an important scene.
The sound is as important as the sharpness of the picture.
A blur pan catches up with the chase.
Turning around its axis, the camera sweeps the area where the characters are moving
like a police camera inspecting the flow of traffic.
Or a surveillance camera trying to catch burglars in action.
The coordination of the movements and the speed of the actors create an impression of complexity in this very efficient shot, clearly showing Jurieu and Robert carrying Geneviève.
We barely notice them in the blur pan meant to capture the chase.
The speed is due to the perfect synchronization between the acting and the technical precision.
ln this high society people do not look at each other.
They talk within the same frame by using a prop: a gramophone, a clockwork doll, a mirror...
... or a bow tie.
There can be intimacy only by forgetting the rules in private.
When the rule is scorned because of tensions, rare cross- cut shots underline the contrast between the characters.
The wide angle highlights the class difference between the Marquis and Octave.
A high camera angle, a low camera angle.
They also highlight the faith in an elitist order.
And the high angle shots show the true relation to the earth: ownership and domination.
ln each scene, the camera frames the action to show who is in the game and who is temporarily out.
People coming in and going out of shot have a specific meaning.
The scenes starting with an empty frame show us individuals who have lost touch with reality either following an accident, or because they are overtaken by the death they orchestrated
or went mad after battling with very strong feelings.
Just like a conductor, Renoir uses the dynamics between picture and sound.
ln this movie, the sound track is as important as the photography.
The noise starts the action.
A foreigner, Christine corrects her husband' s pronunciation.
Renoir reminds us of her nationality and forces us to remember the name of Lisette' s husband.
The sound underlines the acting.
The sound of the spring sets off the erotic assault.
Be it close or far.
The sound comes near then goes away.
The depth of sound seems to be carefully chosen.
Baroque music is only heard at the beginning and end of "The Rules of the Game".
Otherwise music has a physical source in the frame: a radio, a phonograph, a robot,
a clockwork doll, or a few music instruments such as a piano, a Pianola,
a trumpet,
a hunting horn.
Generally, the music stems from a machine and it always accompanies the action or an amorous feeling.
It also reveals the artifice of passion.
Only Marceau and Octave, the outcasts, escape the mechanism of these feelings.
Here, the phonograph' s music sets off the Dionysian desire.
The faun chases the nymph.
This scene announces trouble at La Colinière.
The camera pans from the music sheets to the pianist' s hands then dollies back.
Renoir backs up to have an overall view as in the beginning of the movie.
This shot heralds a sequence that will twist the plot round, change the movie' s rhythm and directing and speed up all the elements.
The editing immediately unsettles the viewer even more.
The pianist' s glance introduces the shot of the little theatre.
To obtain a POV shot matching this glance a camera must be placed to the left of the scene, near the piano.
Renoir however places his camera to the right.
It no longer depends on the action.
A panning truck shot describes the space, showing first the small theatre, then the guests and the servants in the hallway, and the higher- ranking servants.
The stage looks at the audience, the audience is watching the stage.
It is a genuine game of mirrors.
ln the wings, excitement prevails.
Geneviève is in the Marquis' arms, openly divulging their affair.
ln reprisal, Christine pulls Saint- Aubin, her clumsiest suitor.
Jurieu wants to react but he is held back.
The audience is demanding, the game must continue.
New couples are made up for the finale.
Christine and Saint- Aubin walk by.
At a glance, Jackie evaluates her chances of marrying Jurieu.
The viewer must see her to understand the plot.
Such speed had never been seen in 1939.
Renoir goes beyond the simple classical threesome.
Christine thinks she loves four men:
Robert, Saint- Aubin, Octave and Jurieu.
Lisette loves three:
Marceau, Schumacher and Octave.
The game of love becomes more complex.
As always with Renoir, the theatre is a mirror where one projects a collective image, aspirations and an imaginary world.
Here the camera faces the stage from a slightly low angle as if it were a spectator.
Renoir invites us to step back, to think twice about this society putting on a show.
The costumes were chosen on purpose.
The year is 1939.
The actors, dressed as Tyrolians, sing an ultranationalist song, a nationalist hymn to the glory of the French army.
They thus ridicule the ideals of their parents, who at the beginning of the third Republic incarnated the peak of the French bourgeoisie.
On the eve of the war with Germany, such images are explosive.
ln "The Rules of the Game", Renoir shows a privileged group making fun of the values on which their society is based.
ln 1939, they are rejecting their own nationality, fearing neither nazism nor fascism.
On the contrary, they appreciate law and order.
What they feared was the Popular Front in 1936.
It is snobbish to be common.
With new social benefits, the lower class thinks it has the same privileges as its masters.
They want to imitate their masters and to enter the privileged family.
- Some asparagus?
- No thank you.
Never preserves.
Only fresh foods because of the vitamins.
French society is morally apathetic.
Renoir' s anger at this explodes in these terrible words:
You gave me a chance by hiring me as a servant.
lmagine Figaro saying these words on the eve of the Revolution.
But the movie is inspired by this play.
Marceau plays Figaro.
ln the movie, the names are not randomly chosen.
Marceau was a republican general during the French Revolution.
"La Marseillaise".
There is also an ancestor of La Chesnaye in that movie.
The La Chesnaye in "La Marseillaise" is an ultra- royalist supporter of Marie- Antoinette, the Austrian.
The marquise is also Austrian.
You still are my little girl from Salzburg.
Renoir defends the three ideals of the Revolution: for him, there is no freedom without equality, no equality without brotherhood.
It even flaunts them to rid them of their meaning.
They all seem so free yet they are totally subjugated to their rules.
They pretend to be equal, to a certain extent.
They too are entitled to some fun.
They pretend to be brotherly despite facts to the contrary.
Dear Marceau, you will also have to leave.
l can' t fire Schumacher and let you stay here with his wife.
- It would be immoral.
- I understand.
Friendship and camaraderie are mere delusions.
ln 1789, ownership was established as a principle.
l don' t care about their money.
lt' s too stupid to work for others.
But ownership destroys equality, distorts brotherhood and in the end corrupts the notion of freedom.
The Marquis is immensely rich.
He pretends to believe that wealth is not important.
For Renoir, ownership is worse than theft, it' s the root of crime.
We know what to do with the likes of Marceau.
A good riffle shot at night in the woods.
The small landowner embodies the fundamental vice: he kills to defend his property.
That is why on stage, where their costumes betray them, the owners are shown as ghosts led by death.
Why does Jurieu have to die?
Because he is the only one who dares to risk his life.
For Christine, he risked his life by crossing the Atlantic.
From an imaginary place, a mythical era of chivalry.
A romantic hero, like Don Quichotte, he believes in the dream of sincerity, the illusion of loyalty and honesty.
He believes in the anachronistic values of this landowners' world.
l must tell La Chesnaye.
What for?
Because it is the right thing to do.
He loves the ethereal and romantic idea of a grand lady with a pure heart.
Because the character is innocent and honest as well as weak, he is a perfect target.
The rule requires that the intruder be eliminated or leave.
As in the theatre, the cast returns to the stage.
This society still shines like the false light of a dead star.
But its fundamental values have disappeared.
It tries to delude itself about its existence by gravitating faster,
to better discover its emptiness.
And the ghosts' shadows return to the castle.
AUDlOPHASE
Holy mackerel!
Get the lieutenant.
That thing' s doing about 4, 000!
- But that' s incredible, sir.
Must be a buzz bomb.
This is Luckton at Ferris to Charlie Baker.
I have a bogey at 200, 000 feet.
4, 000 miles an hour.
(speaks Hindustani)
(man speaking French on radio)
Reports are coming in from all over the Empire, all over the world.
The government has not yet issued a statement, but there is no question that there actually is a large, unidentified object circling the Earth at incredible speed.
This is Elmer Davis again.
We still don' t know what it is or where it comes from, but there' s something there.
It' s been tracked around the Earth by radar, travelling at a rate of4, 000 miles an hour.
This is not another "flying saucer" scare.
Whatever it is, it' s something real.
We interrupt this programme to give you a bulletin from a naval unit at sea.
An object travelling at supersonic speed is headed towards the East Coast of the States.
This is HV Kaltenborn speaking.
Here in the nation' s capital there is anxiety and concern, but no outward sign of panic.
As a matter of fact, there are signs of normalcy - the beautiful spring weather, the tourist crowds around the public monuments and other buildings.
(distant humming)
(humming crescendos)
(screaming)
They' re here!
They' re here!
Over on the Mall!
They' ve landed!
(sirens)
- Thank you.
Hold the line, please.
Hello.
I want to speak to the president.
I' m sorry, but you' il have to interrupt him.
This is Drew Pearson.
We bring you this special broadcast in order to give you the very latest information on an amazing phenomenon: the arrival of a spaceship in Washington.
Government and Defense Department officials are concerned by reports of panic in several large eastern cities.
I am authorised to assure you that, so far, there is no reasonable cause for alarm.
The rumours of invading armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria and are absolutely false.
I repeat, these rumours are absolutely false.
Landed in Washington today at 3. 47pm Eastern Standard Time.
We still do not know where it came from.
The ship is now resting exactly where it landed two hours ago, and so far there is no sign of life from inside it.
They are supported by tanks, artillery and machine guns.
Behind the police lines there' s a huge crowd of curiosity seekers.
The army has taken every precaution to meet any emergency which may develop.
Every eye, every weapon is trained on the ship.
It' s been that way for two hours, and the tension is just beginning...
I think something is happening.
We have come to visit you in peace, and with goodwill.
(screaming)
(screaming)
Gort!
Deglet ovrosco!
It was a gift for your president.
With this, he could have studied life on the other planets.
Take him to Walter Reed Hospital right away.
Mr Harley, sir, from the White House.
- General.
- Right in there, Mr Harley.
My name is Harley, secretary to the president.
I' ve been told you speak our language, and that your name is Mr...
Klaatu?
Just Klaatu.
The president conveys his deepest apologies for what happened.
Sit down, Mr Harley.
Thank you.
I' m sure I need hardly point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.
Had you been travelling long?
Your months.
You must have come a long way.
About 250 million of your miles.
Naturally, we are very curious to know where you come from.
From another planet.
Let' s just say that we' re neighbours.
It' s hard for us to think of a planet as a neighbour.
In the present situation you' il have to learn to think that way.
- The present situation?
- I mean the reason for my coming here.
We' re very curious about that, too.
- Would you care to talk about it?
- I' d be glad to.
Not now, of course, with you alone.
You' d rather talk personally with the president?
This is not a personal matter, Mr Harley.
It concerns all the people on your planet.
I' m not sure I understand.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I' m afraid that would be a little awkward.
It' s completely without precedent.
And there are practical considerations - the time involved, the enormous distances.
I travelled 250 million miles.
I appreciate that, but...
I want to be frank with you, Mr...
I mean Klaatu.
Our world at the moment is full of tensions and suspicions.
In the present international situation, such a meeting would be quite impossible.
What about your United Nations?
You know about the United Nations?
We' ve been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years.
- That' s how we learned your languages.
Surely...
I' m not concerned with the internal affairs of your planet.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles.
It concerns the existence of every last creature on Earth.
Perhaps if you could explain a little...
I intend to explain.
To all the nations, at the same time.
How do we proceed, Mr Harley?
Well, we could call a special meeting of the General Assembly.
But the UN doesn' t represent all the nations.
Then I suggest a meeting of all the chiefs of state.
Believe me, you don' t understand.
They wouldn' t sit down to the same table.
I don' t want to resort to threats, Mr Harley.
I merely tell you that the future of your planet is at stake.
I urge that you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth.
I will make that recommendation to the president.
But I must tell you in all honesty, I' m extremely dubious about the results.
Apparently I' m not as cynical about Earth' s people as you are.
I have been dealing in Earth' s politics a good deal longer than you have.
Good night, sir.
It is now 2am, and the giant robot still hasn' t moved.
Engineers from nearby Fort Belvoir have failed to budge him, and metallurgical experts have found his huge body impregnable.
They' re now concentrating on the ship itself, so far with no results.
Getting anyplace, Sergeant?
Oh, no, sir.
This beats me, sir.
I saw the ramp come through the side of the ship right here.
Now I can' t even find a crack.
Oh, Carlson.
What' s the report?
No luck, sir.
We' ve tried everything from a blowtorch to a diamond drill.
- What about him?
- He' s made out of the same stuff.
- Has he moved, Sergeant?
Not an inch.
This is the toughest material I ever saw, General.
For hardness and strength, it' s out of this world.
I can tell you officially that' s where it came from!
The skeletal structure' s completely normal.
The tests show the same for major organs - the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
Yeah, and the lungs are the same as ours.
That must mean a similar atmosphere, similar pressure.
- How old do you think he is?
- Oh, I' d say 35, 38.
He told me this morning while I was examining him.
He' s 78.
- Well, I don' t believe it.
- Life expectancy is 130.
- How does he explain that?
- Says their medicine' s much more advanced.
He was very nice about it, but he made me feel like a third- class witch doctor.
I removed a bullet from that man' s arm yesterday.
- Well, what about it?
- I just examined the wound, and it' s healed.
- What does he say about it?
- Said he put salve on it, stuff he had on him.
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Take it downstairs and have it analysed.
Then I don' t know whether to just get drunk or give up the practice of medicine.
- Afternoon, Mr Harley.
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Good afternoon.
I' m glad to see you up and around.
- Thank you.
Have you any news?
- Not very good news, I' m afraid.
The president accepted your suggestion, and cabled the invitations for a meeting.
Let me read you some of the replies.
"The premier wishes to inform the US Government it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the president, unless the meeting is held in Moscow."
"The suggestion of the president of the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to His Majesty' s Government at present."
"Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."
Well, there you have it.
Now you understand more clearly, perhaps you' d like to discuss it with the president.
I will not speak with any one nation or group of nations.
I don' t intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies.
Our problems are very complex, Klaatu.
- You mustn’ t judge us too harshly.
- I can judge only by what I see.
- Your impatience is quite understandable.
- I' m impatient with stupidity.
- My people have learned to live without it.
- I' m afraid my people haven' t.
I am very sorry.
I wish it were otherwise.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people, and become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Under the circumstances, I' m afraid that' s impossible.
I must ask that you don' t try to leave the hospital.
Our military people have insisted on this.
I' m sure you understand.
- The man from the spaceship got away!
- What?
Get every available man.
(reporter) Hospital authorities refuse to comment on how he managed to escape...
He' s not eight feet tall, as reported, nor does he have tentacles... (reporter# 3) There' s no denying a monster is at large, and we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and power.
The public is advised to take ordinary precautions and to remain calm as we await...
until they' ve had an opportunity to study the ship.
Not only are these the closest planets to Earth, but all research to date indicates they are the only two planets capable of sustaining life as we know it.
However, all reputable scientists warn against jumping to hasty conclusions.
Professor Havemeyer of MlT, for example, points out it’ s possible, in light of our meagre knowledge.
The president has urged all citizens to be on the alert for any information about this man, and to transmit such information immediately to the police, the army or the FBl.
While the president made no effort to minimise the crisis, he urged people all over the country to remain calm.
And I might add, that though this man maybe our bitter enemy, he could be also a new- found friend.
- Unfortunately, the only photos we have...
- Mom, do you think I could...?
- Hey, who' s that? -.. do not show the man' s face.
The president said the entire facilities of the FBI and every other federal agency are being brought to bear.
He pointed out, however, that this is no ordinary manhunt.
He warned "We maybe up against powers that are beyond our control..."
- What is it you want?
- My name is Carpenter.
I need a room.
- Oh, I see.
- Are you an FBI man?
- No, I' m afraid not.
- I' il bet he is.
He' s looking for the spaceman.
We' ve all been hearing too much about spacemen.
- This is Mrs Benson, Mr Carpenter.
- How do you do?
And little Bobby.
- Mr and Mrs Barley.
And Mr Krull.
- How do you do?
And I' m Mrs Crockett.
I have a very nice room on the second floor.
It gets the sun all day long.
I know what he looks like.
- He' s got a big square head with three eyes.
- That' s enough, Bobby.
Excuse me.
We mustn' t annoy Mr Carpenter, or he won' t want to stay here.
He' s really a dear little boy, and quiet as a mouse.
- You' re a long way from home, aren' t you?
- How did you know?
I can tell a New England accent a mile away.
(radio) Now we take you to Miami Beach, Florida, for a report from Gabriel Heatter.
Mr Heatter?
(Heatter) And now on this Sunday morning we ask some questions that have been haunting the entire nation for two whole days.
This creature: where is he?
What is he up to?
If he can build a spaceship that can fly to Earth, and a robot that can destroy our tanks and guns, what other terrors can he unleash at will?
He must be tracked down like a wild animal.
He must be destroyed.
But where would such a creature hide?
Would he disappear into the north woods?
Would he crawl into the sewers of some great city?
Everybody agrees there is grave danger.
The question remains: what can we do to protect ourselves?
What measures can we take to neutralise this menace from another world?
Of course, but how?
And if we do destroy it, what do we face in retaliation?
- It' s not a simple problem...
- George, turn it off.
I' m trying to concentrate.
Why doesn' t the government do something?
What can they do?
They' re only people, like us.
People, my foot!
They' re Democrats.
It gives you the shakes.
He' s got that robot standing there, just waiting for orders to destroy us.
We automatically assume he' s a menace.
- Maybe he isn' t at all.
- Then what' s he hiding for?
- Why doesn' t he come out in the open?
- Like Heatter says, "What' s he up to?"
- Maybe he' s afraid.
- He' s afraid!
Well, after all, he was shot the minute he landed here.
- I was just wondering what I would do.
- Perhaps before deciding on any action, you' d want to know more about the people, to orient yourself in a strange environment.
- There' s nothing strange about Washington.
- A person from another planet may disagree.
If you want my opinion, he comes from right here on Earth.
And you know where I mean.
Only planes.
I wouldn' t be too sure about that.
That fellow wants something, otherwise he wouldn' t be here.
That right, Mr Carpenter?
I' m a little confused.
Oh, Mrs Benson, Mr Stevens is here to see you.
Oh, thank you.
Excuse me.
George, finish your coffee.
I promised the Carsons I' d be there at 11.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
We' re set.
I put gas in the car and the radio' s broken, so we can forget about the spaceman.
I haven' t anyone to stay with Bobby.
- I don' t suppose we could take him with us?
Well, we could.
There' s always someone here, but today they' ve all got plans.
I haven' t any plans.
I' d be happy to spend the day with him, if you’ d let me.
Say, that would be great.
Wouldn' t it?
It' s awfully nice of you to suggest it.
- Sorry.
Mr Carpenter, this is Tom Stevens.
- How do you do, Mr Carpenter?
Hello.
We talked and listened to the radio.
I thought today he might like to show me around the city.
- Well...
- Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels about it?
Fine.
- You think it' s all right?
- Sure.
That' s my father.
He was killed at Anzio.
Did all those people die in wars?
Most of 'em.
Didn' t you ever hear of the Arlington Cemetery?
- No, I' m afraid not.
- You don' t seem to know much of anything.
Very far away.
Is it different where you' ve been?
Don' t they have places like this?
They have cemeteries, but not like this one.
You see, they don' t have any wars.
Gee, that' s a good idea.
- What would you like to do?
- Go to the movies.
- All right.
- No fooling?
No fooling.
Bobby, tell me, do you have to have money to go there?
Mom gave it to me.
- No.
I want to take you to the movie.
Do you think they' d accept these?
Gee, they look like diamonds!
In some places, those are what people use for money.
- They' re easier to carry and don' t wear out.
- I' il bet they' re worth a million dollars.
Would you give me your $2 for two of these?
Well...
Sure.
OK.
Let' s not say anything to Mom about this, though.
- Why not, Bobby?
- She doesn' t like me to steal from people.
Those are great words.
- He must have been a great man.
- Well, sure.
That' s the kind of man I' d like to talk to.
Bobby, who' s the greatest man in America today?
I don' t know.
The spaceman, I guess.
No, I was speaking of earthmen.
I meant the greatest philosopher or thinker.
- You mean the smartest man in the world?
- Yes, that would do nicely.
He' s the greatest scientist.
- He lives here in Washington, doesn' t he?
- Near where Mom works.
- Where' s that?
She' s a secretary.
My mom' s a real secretary.
Mr Carpenter, now can we go see the spaceship?
If you like.
I' il bet that iron guy' s strong and could knock down a whole building.
I shouldn' t be at all surprised.
I' d like to get inside that ship, see how it works.
What do you think makes it go?
A highly developed form of atomic power, I should imagine.
I thought that was only for bombs.
No, it' s for lots of other things, too.
- Do you think it can go faster than the F- 86?
- Yes, I should think so.
- About 1, 000 miles an hour?
- Maybe 4, 000 miles an hour.
And outside the Earth' s atmosphere, a good deal faster.
How could they make a landing?
There are several ways to reduce landing speed.
You see, the basic problem is to overcome the inertia...
Keep going, mister.
He was fallin 'for it!
Thank you, Mrs Robinson.
I' m sure we' ve all shared your fears during the past few days.
I see a gentleman here with his little boy.
What do you think of the spaceship, son?
It' s the biggest spaceship I ever saw.
Mind telling us your name?
- My name is Carpenter.
I suppose you' re just as scared as the rest of us.
In a different way, perhaps.
In fact, I would...
Thank you very much.
I see another gentleman in the crowd...
Extra!
Spaceman eludes police!
Army put in charge.
Read all about it!
Spaceman eludes police!
Extra!
Extra!
Get your paper here.
Army put in charge.
Extra!
Read all about it!
- You think they' il ever find him?
- I don' t know, Bobby.
I' m inclined to doubt it.
Mr Carpenter, what is inertia?
The property of matter by which it remains in uniform motion unless acted upon by external force.
Oh.
I' il bet that' s just the way Professor Barnhardt talks.
Bobby, I have an idea.
- Let' s go and find out how Barnhardt talks.
- You' re kidding!
- Wouldn' t you like to meet him?
- Sure I would, but I bet you' d be scared.
Maybe we can scare him more than he can scare us.
I like you, Mr Carpenter.
You' re a real screwball.
Spaceman still at large.
Extra!
Read all about it.
Get your paper here.
Maybe he isn' t home.
Gee, I' il bet you this is where he works.
What' s that stuff on the blackboard mean?
It' s a problem in celestial mechanics.
I' il bet he' s the only one that knows the answer.
He doesn' t know the answer.
And he' il never get it that way.
We probably couldn' t get to see him even if he was home.
(door opens)
Hey, where are you going?
If he' s that difficult to see, perhaps we ought to leave a calling card.
Did he do it wrong?
He just needs a little help.
What are you doing in here?
How dare you write on that blackboard!
Do you realise the professor' s worked on that problem for weeks?
He' il solve it in no time now.
- How did you get in?
- To see Professor Barnhardt.
Well, he' s not here.
And he won' t be back till this evening.
I think you' d better leave now.
Would you give this to the professor?
I think he' il want to talk to me.
I wouldn' t erase that.
The professor needs it very badly.
(rings doorbell)
- Yeah, he' s inside.
- Tell him I' d like to see him.
Come on in.
- Your name Carpenter?
- Yes.
- Professor Barnhardt been looking for me?
- I' ve been looking for you all afternoon.
Thank you.
- It was a wonderful day.
- You still haven' t answered my question.
You know how I feel, Tom, but I just want to think it over.
Boss goes to Chicago tomorrow.
If I could tell him I was marrying and had dependants...
You' re a good salesman, but I' ve got to think about it.
A good insurance salesman wouldn' t give you time to think about it.
- Good night.
- Night.
- Hiya, Mom.
- Hello, darling.
- Good evening, Mr Carpenter.
- Good evening.
- Uh, Mrs Benson, this is Mr Brady.
- How do you do?
Mr Brady' s a government agent!
- Have a nice day, dear?
- We had a swell time, didn' t we?
Yes.
We went to the movies and had ice- cream cones, and then we went to see Daddy.
- I don' t know how to thank you.
- I enjoyed every minute of it.
We better get going, Mr Carpenter.
Aw, gee, you didn' t finish your story.
I' il finish it tomorrow.
Good night, Bobby.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Come on, dear.
Time to go to bed.
Why did Mr Carpenter have to go with Mr Brady?
Maybe it was a mistake.
Oh.
We sure had fun today.
We saw the spaceship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt.
- Yeah, sure.
- Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
- Yes, of course, dear.
I was hoping I could go out with Mr Carpenter again.
(doorbell)
The professor' s in his study.
Thank you.
(knocks)
This is the man you wanted to see, Professor.
- Thank you, Captain.
- I' il wait outside.
- You wrote this?
- It was a clumsy way to introduce myself.
But I understand you' re a difficult man to see.
- I thought you' d have the solution by now.
- Not yet.
That' s why I wanted to see you.
All you have to do now is to substitute this expression at this point.
That will reproduce the first- order term.
But what about the effect of the other terms?
Almost negligible.
With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
How can you be so sure?
Have you tested this theory?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.
I am Klaatu.
I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital, room 309.
My doctor' s name was Major White.
If you’ re not interested or if you intend to turn me over to your army, we needn' t waste any more time.
You may go now, Captain.
Please thank General Cutler, and tell him... tell him that I know this gentleman.
You have faith.
It' s curiosity.
Sit down, please.
There are several thousand questions I' d like to ask you.
- I' d like to explain something of my mission.
- That was my first question.
We know from observation that your planet has discovered a rudimentary atomic energy.
- And that you' re experimenting with rockets.
- Yes, that is true.
While you were limited to fighting among yourselves with primitive tanks and aircraft, we were unconcerned.
But soon one of your nations will apply atomic energy to spaceships.
That will create a threat to the peace and security of other planets.
That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr Klaatu?
I came here to warn you that by threatening danger, your planet faces danger, very grave danger.
- I' m prepared, however, to offer a solution.
- Would you care to be more specific?
What I have to say must be said to all concerned.
It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not successful.
I come to you as a last resort, and I confess my patience is wearing thin.
- Must I take drastic action to get a hearing?
- What... what sort of action do you mean?
Violent action, since that seems to be the only thing your people understand.
Levelling New York City perhaps, or sinking the Rock of Gibraltar.
Would you meet with the group of scientists I' m calling together?
You could explain your mission to them and they, in turn, could present it to their peoples.
That' s why I came to see you.
It is not enough to have men of science.
We scientists are too often ignored or misunderstood.
We must get leaders from every field - the finest minds in the world.
I leave that in your hands.
One thing, Mr Klaatu.
What is the alternative?
I' m afraid there is no alternative.
In such a case, the planet Earth would have to be... eliminated.
Such power exists?
I assure you, such power exists.
The people who come to the meeting must be made to realise this.
They must understand what is at stake.
- You mentioned a demonstration of force.
- Yes.
- Would one be possible before the meeting?
- Yes, of course.
Something to dramatise for them and their people the seriousness of the situation.
- Something to affect the entire planet.
- That can easily be arranged.
I wouldn' t want you to harm anybody or destroy anything.
Leave it to me.
I' il think of something.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Something dramatic, but not destructive.
That' s quite an interesting problem.
Would the day after tomorrow be all right, say about noon?
(radio) There are no further developments, but police and the FBI are tracing every possible clue and rounding up all suspects...
- Rummy!
- Oh, my.
Did it again!
- Take a hand, Mr Carpenter?
- Take a...?
Oh.
No, thanks.
We don' t...
No, thanks.
- Are you going out, dear?
Tom' s picking me up.
Personally, I wouldn' t go out after dark these days.
But then I' m not courting, am l?
Oh!
Oh, Mr Carpenter.
Everyone seems so...
"Jittery" is the word.
Bobby' s the only person I know who isn' t... jittery.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
- He' s a fine boy, Mrs Benson.
- Naturally, I think so.
Warm, friendly, intelligent.
Mr Carpenter...
This is none of my business, but why did that man come here last night?
They just wanted to ask me a few questions.
He wasn' t in.
Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
(doorbell)
Excuse me.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Are you ready?
- In a minute.
- The picture starts at 8. 50.
- I was with Mr Carpenter.
- I hope he won' t think I' m intruding.
- Sh!
- What...
Good evening.
Excuse me, I was just going up to my room.
- Good night, Mr Carpenter.
- Have a good time, both of you.
(both) Thank you.
Why don' t you wait in here while I get my things?
Tom, that was awful.
- I' m just tired of hearing about Mr Carpenter.
- Tom!
I don' t like how he' s attached himself to you and Bobby.
What do you know about him?
I' il go get my things.
All you have to remember is first find the common denominator, and then divide.
Thanks, Mr Carpenter.
- I' il say good night again.
- Mr Carpenter...
I...
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs Benson.
- Bed now.
You can finish that in the morning.
- OK.
Bobby.
I think it would be better if we didn' t see quite so much of Mr Carpenter.
Gee, why, Mom?
He' s my best friend, and he' s awful good in arithmetic.
He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Did you really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Sure we did.
He wasn' t there, but we went to see him.
And Mr Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
Mom, is something wrong with Mr Carpenter?
- What do you mean, dear?
- On account of last night.
You think he' s a bank robber, or a gangster maybe?
No, dear, of course not.
He' s a very nice man.
I just think that he might prefer to be left alone, that' s all.
Now you go to bed and forget about it.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.
Mom?
Why would he wanna be left alone?
Don' t forget to brush your teeth.
(train whistle blows)
- Bobby, have you a flashlight?
- Yeah.
- Fine.
All you gotta do is push up on it.
- Oh.
- What do you need it for?
- I' ve, uh...
The light in my room went out.
Oh.
I must tell you sometime about a kind of train that doesn' t need any tracks.
- Really?
- Really.
- Remind me in the morning to tell you.
No tracks.
Gort!
Baringa!
(alien language)
(Mrs Benson) Come in for a minute.
- Bobby, what are you doing up?
- I couldn' t sleep.
I had to tell you.
- Tell me what?
- After you left, I followed Mr Carpenter, and where do you think he went?
Right into the spaceship!
- Now, Bobby, wait a minute.
I saw him.
It opened up and he walked in.
That big iron fella was walking around, too.
- Bobby, you' ve been dreaming again.
- No, I haven' t, Mom.
Honest.
I promise you, I saw him!
- Where' d you see all this?
- On the lawn down at the Mall.
- In that place with the soldiers out in front.
- Where were the soldiers?
That big iron guy grabbed 'em and knocked' em out.
I like Mr Carpenter, Mom, but I' m kinda scared.
It was only a bad dream.
Here, we' il prove it to you.
- Tom, ask Mr Carpenter to come down.
- Sure.
- He' s in the room next to mine.
- OK.
Think back.
You didn' t follow Mr Carpenter at all, did you?
You haven' t even been outside.
- Yes, I have!
- You didn' t really see a spaceship,
- but you thought you did.
- I' d never call you a liar.
He' s not there, but look what I found in his room.
- Is it real?
- It looks real to me.
Mr Carpenter' s got lots of diamonds.
He gave me a couple of 'em.
- He gave these to you?
- Well, not exactly.
I gave him two dollars.
This doesn' t make sense.
I never did trust him.
- Gee, you think he' s a diamond smuggler?
- You' re going to bed now.
- I wonder if we...
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
- Do you think it' s all right to stay here?
- I' ve got a good lock on my door.
Bobby' s gonna sleep in my room tonight.
Come on now, up to bed with you.
Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
The grass was kinda wet.
- I' m going now, Helen.
- All right.
- Hello.
- May I see you for a minute?
- Well, I' m just going to lunch.
- May I walk out with you?
- Well...
- (phone rings)
Mrs Benson speaking.
Oh, hello.
I' m getting an appraisal on that diamond.
Can we lunch together?
Can I talk to you later?
Oh, that' il be fine.
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school.
- Yes?
- I' d like to know what he told you last night.
I really didn' t pay much attention.
Bobby has such an active imagination.
Did you believe what he told you?
I have a reason for asking this.
A very important reason.
There' s another elevator we can use.
- What is it you want?
- Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you.
- What happened?
- What time is it?
Just 12. 00.
We shall be here for a little while.
About 30 minutes.
- We can try pushing the other buttons.
- They won' t work.
- Why not?
- You see, the electricity' s been neutralised... all over the world.
Bobby was telling the truth, wasn' t he?
Yes.
That' s what it is.
(mutters in French)
(mutters in Russian)
You should see it!
You should go out and see it for yourself!
Thanks.
I am enjoying it right here.
The city has stopped.
People are running around like ants.
What a brilliant idea.
I never would have thought of it.
The people who are coming to the meeting tonight, have they arrived?
I talked to them on the phone.
They' re all very curious about the meeting.
Good.
Did you speak to our friend Mr Carpenter?
He' il be there at 8. 30.
Tell me, Hilda, does all this frighten you?
Does it make you feel insecure?
It certainly does.
- That' s good, Hilda.
I' m glad.
As far as we can tell, power' s been cut off everywhere, with a few exceptions.
And even these exceptions are remarkable - hospitals, planes in flight, that sort of thing.
I wish I could tell you more but, as you know, all communications are out - telephones, radio, cable, everything.
I can tell you the president is prepared to declare a state of national emergency.
- Eleanor, did you call the electrician?
- I tried, but the phone doesn' t work either.
- Well, call the phone company.
- But the phone doesn' t work!
- Is it worth anything?
- I have never seen such a stone in all my life.
- Will you tell me where it came from?
- That' s what I want you to tell me.
But there are no diamonds like this anyplace in the world that I know of.
- Are you sure of that?
- Uh, would you like to sell it?
No.
No, thanks.
- I' d give you a very good price.
- Thank you, no.
I' ve told you more than I told Barnhardt because, in a sense, my life is in your hands.
I thought if you knew the facts, you' d see the importance of the meeting tonight.
Of course.
Of course I do.
- You hold great hope for this meeting.
- I can see no other hope for your planet.
If this meeting should fail, then I' m afraid there is no hope.
It must be 12. 30.
Yes.
Just exactly.
(horns blaring)
- Where are you going now?
- The boarding house.
I can watch Bobby.
He' s the only other person who knows...
There' s someone else.
- Who?
Tom.
He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
- Do you think he' d tell anyone?
- I think he' d talk to me first anyway, before...
Well, we can' t take any chance.
I' il get in touch with him right away to make sure.
But I' ve got to talk to him.
It' s important.
When is he coming back?
I don' t know, Mrs Benson.
He left before noon, before that awful electric business.
I...
No, he wouldn' t tell me where he was going.
He said it was something personal.
Well, please ask him to call me the minute he gets in.
Thanks.
Before we discuss plans, I want a report from Colonel Ryder.
What about the robot?
I was directed by the Joint Chiefs to find a means of immobilising him.
We accomplished that this morning by encasing him in a block of KL93, a new plastic material stronger than steel.
- Isn' t it possible he' s broken out?
We just checked on that.
- All right.
Now we concentrate on the man.
Up till now we' ve agreed upon the desirability of capturing this man alive.
We can no longer afford to be so particular.
We' il get him, alive if possible, but we must get him.
- Is that clear?
- (all) Yes, sir.
Honest, Mary, I' m so scared I can' t sit still.
I' d like to run someplace, but I don' t know where to go.
Find out who' s in charge of this spaceman business.
- Whoever it is, I wanna talk to him.
- Mrs Benson called.
She says it' s important.
Get this other call first.
- Oh, Mrs Benson, he just walked in.
- Fine.
- Are you nervous, too?
- Yes, I am.
- Helen, come on in.
- I' ve been trying to get you all afternoon.
I have some terrific news about Mr Carpenter.
- What about him?
- He' s the spaceman.
I had that diamond checked at three places.
Nobody' s ever seen a stone like that.
After what Bobby told us, that' s enough for me.
Why is it nobody knows about him?
Why hasn' t he got money?
All right, Tom, it' s true.
I know it' s true.
How do you know?
- Never mind about that.
- Promise you won' t say a word to anybody.
- After what happened today?!
- You don' t realise how important this is.
- Of course it' s important.
- And we can do something about it.
- That' s what I' m saying.
We must do nothing.
- Believe me.
- He' s a menace.
It' s our duty to turn him in.
But he isn' t a menace.
He told me why he came here.
He told...
He told you?
Oh, don' t be silly, honey, just because you like the guy.
You realise what this' d mean to us?
- I' d be the biggest man in the country.
- Is that what you' re thinking about?
- Somebody has to get rid of him.
- (phone)
I won' t let you do it.
- Yes?
- This is important...
What' s his name, Margaret?
General Cutler.
Yes.
Oh, all right, I' il hold on.
You mustn' t.
The rest of the world is involved.
I don' t care about the rest of the world.
You' il feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
- You wait.
You' re gonna marry a big hero.
- I' m not going to marry anybody.
- Helen, I...
Hello, General Cutler?
I want to speak to the general.
Tell him it' s about the spaceman.
That' s right.
That' s where he' s staying.
- Yes, of course I' m sure.
- Thank you, Mr Stevens.
I' il want to talk to you further, but I haven' t time now.
Deploy all Zone Five units according to Plan B. Immediately!
- Hello, Mrs Benson.
- Hello, Sammy.
Attention, all units.
When deployed according to Plan Baker, maintain station and remain on radio alert until further orders.
I' m sure Barnhardt can hide me until the meeting.
- Where' s the meeting going to be?
- At the ship.
Yeah, they got in a taxicab and went off down that street.
Thank you, son.
Attention, Zone Five.
Yellow cab moving north on 14th Street from Harvard Street.
Man and woman in back seat.
Get licence number and report.
That' s the one!
Right.
Licence number of target vehicle is H0012.
Looks like something big' s going on.
Report when target vehicle passes your position.
- It' s only a few blocks to Barnhardt' s.
- I' m worried about Gort.
I' m afraid of what he might do if anything should happen to me.
But he' s a robot.
Without you, what could he do?
There' s no limit to what he could do.
He could destroy the Earth.
If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort.
You must say these words:
Klaatu barada nikto.
Please repeat that.
Klaatu... barada nikto.
You must remember those words.
(murmurs) Klaatu barada nikto.
Yellow cab, licence number H0012, heading west on 15th Street at Treasury Place.
The target vehicle is turning west into Massachusetts Avenue.
Repeat, Columbia Road and Connecticut.
Attention, all units, northwest area, Zone Five.
Block off all streets intersecting Connecticut Avenue on a line from Wisconsin to the park.
All vehicles close in.
Let' s go.
Say, what' s going on here?
Drive...
Get that message to Gort... right away.
- Captain, hold these people back.
- Yes, sir.
See if they have a stretcher at the police station.
Take him there.
Gort.
Klaatu barada nikto.
Klaatu barada nikto.
Yes, sir.
Yes, we have the body here now, locked in a cell.
There' s no question about it, General.
He' s dead all right.
I understand.
I' il be right there, sir.
Place a guard around that cell.
- Captain, don' t let anyone in or out of here.
- Yes, sir.
Come along.
- Professor Barnhardt?
- Yes.
I' m very sorry, but I have to ask you to call off this meeting.
Call it off?
But I had permission from the army.
I know, sir, but the robot' s on the loose, and it' s not safe.
You have to get your people out.
(electronic humming)
(humming crescendoes)
(humming stops)
Hello.
I...
I thought you were...
I was.
You mean... he has the power of life and death?
No.
That power is reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
This technique, in some cases, can restore life for a limited period.
But... how long?
You mean, how long will I live?
That, no one can tell.
Under the circumstances, the army people have asked us to leave.
I can do nothing but suggest that we comply.
I am leaving soon, and you will forgive me if I speak bluntly.
The universe grows smaller every day, and the threat of aggression by any group anywhere can no longer be tolerated.
There must be security for all, or no one is secure.
This does not mean giving up any freedom, except the freedom to act irresponsibly.
Your ancestors knew this when they made laws to govern themselves, and hired policemen to enforce them.
We of the other planets have long accepted this principle.
We have an organisation for the mutual protection of all planets, and for the complete elimination of aggression.
The test of any such higher authority is, of course, the police force that supports it.
For our policemen, we created a race of robots.
Their function is to patrol the planets in spaceships like this one, and preserve the peace.
In matters of aggression we have given them absolute power over us.
This power cannot be revoked.
At the first sign of violence, they act automatically against the aggressor.
The penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk.
The result is, we live in peace, without arms or armies, secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war, free to pursue more profitable enterprises.
We do not pretend to have achieved perfection, but we do have a system, and it works.
I came here to give you these facts.
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet.
But if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder.
Your choice is simple.
Join us and live in peace, or pursue your present course and face obliteration.
We shall be waiting for your answer.
The decision rests with you.
Gort!
Baringa.
(murmurs of confusion) (screaming)
Vision text Subtitles:
- Joint raided!
- No, no.
It' s just our Raymond, our loveable Sergeant Shaw.
All right, let' s go, you men!
Come on!
- Let' s go!
- Come on, Sarge.
Gertrude buy you beer.
What' s the matter him?
I' m afraid our Saint Raymond, he don' t approve.
Well, maybe he' s got a girl back home or something.
Our Raymond?
Are you kidding?!
- Silvers, how about the robe?
- What do you mean, my robe?
Get out!
- Bad here.
- How do you know?
Chunjin born two miles from here, Captain.
Every place we' ve been in Korea, this joker was born two miles from it.
- What' s so bad about it?
- Tricky.
Swamp all around.
30 yards up, maybe quicksand.
Nobody said anything about quicksand.
- Can' t we go round it?
- No, Sergeant.
- What' s your personal advice?
- All walk in single line, next 200 yards.
Rejected.
Not tactical to advance in single line.
Patrol sink.
Can' t we go round it?
No, Sergeant.
OK, pass the word.
This nation jealously guards its highest award for valour, the Congressional Medal of Honor.
In the Korean war, with 5, 720, 000 personnel engaged, only 77 men were so honoured.
One of these 77 men was Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw.
Raymond Shaw was returned from combat and flown to Washington to be decorated personally by the President of the United States.
This is why his presence, or that of any Medal of Honor winner, is sufficient to bring generals to their feet, saluting.
Congratulations, son.
Like Captain Idiot in "Astounding Science" comics.
Hold it, General!
Hold it, General, please!
Get in there quickly, quickly!
Mother, what is this?
What are you doing here?
Senator Iselin, how does it feel to be the father of a Medal of Honor winner?
- He' s not my father!
- He' s Raymond' s stepfather.
I can only say that as one who has devoted his life to the service of his country...
You did this, Mother.
Darling, you' re a Medal of Honor winner.
Congratulations.
I was going to write, but we' ve been in a frightful mess of late.
All right, let him through!
That' s enough now!
That' s enough, I said!
Let him through!
Say cheese.
All right, that' s enough, now.
That' s enough.
Let the poor boy through.
What' s wrong?
We' ve gone to a good deal of trouble to...
Arrange the parade for you and so forth.
- A parade?
- Get that out!
Why, you publicity- sick, flag- simple goob!
Just because your parents and the country...
Who' s kidding who, Mother?
Johnny' s up for re- election in November.
You' ve got it all figured out.
Johnny Iselin' s boy, Medal of Honor winner.
That should get you 50, 000 votes.
I' m your mother.
How can you talk to me this way?
You know I want nothing for myself.
My life is devoted to helping you and Johnny.
- Mother, stop it.
- My two little boys.
That is all I have...
After his arrival in Washington,
Raymond Shaw was decorated at the White House by the President of the United States.
"He led his patrol, which had been listed as missing in action for three days, back through the enemy lines to safety."
A gift from the Citizens For Iselin Committee for his last birthday.
It saved our lives during the campaign.
You see, this opens up into a double bed.
This is the press room.
And this...
This is my private office.
Anything to take the pain out of campaigning, eh?
That' s what I always say!
- May I take this thing off now, Mother?
- Raymond, what is the matter with you?
You look as if your head were about to come to a point.
Johnny, fix him a drink.
Sit down, Raymond!
We' il be home in less than three hours.
I' m not going home with you, Mother.
I' m going to New York.
What?!
I' ve got a job on a newspaper.
Research assistant to Mr Holborn Gaines.
Holborn Gaines?
That Communist?!
He' s not a Communist, Mother.
As a matter of fact, he' s a Republican.
But the terrible things he' s written about Johnny!
He came to interview me at the White House.
Afterwards I asked him for a job.
He gave it to me.
What could you possibly have in common with that dreadful old man?
For one thing, we discovered that we both loathe and despise you and Johnny.
And that' s a beginning.
The war in Korea was over.
Captain, now Major, Bennett Marco had been reassigned to Army Intelligence in Washington.
It was, by and large, a pleasant assignment, except for one thing.
Stop it...
Another modern discovery which we owe to the hydrangea concerns the influence of air drainage upon plant climate.
Many years ago, when I was travelling about the country,
I noticed magnificent hydrangeas on the hills, where the air drainage was, uh... perfect, and very poor specimens, or perhaps none at all, in the valleys.
Formerly, we used to consider sheltered valleys more favourable to plants than hilltops.
But the avoidance of late spring and early autumn frosts enjoyed by sites with good air drainage, where the cold air can drain safely away to lower levels, gives the hills a decided advantage.
Thus it was the hydrangeas that gave the first pointer in another modern discovery of horticultural importance.
From this, it might appear that the hydrangea is a fairly simple plant, but there are more complications.
The cultivation of hydrangeas was evolved from a number of varieties originally found in Japan.
Not all of which, of course, have the same characteristics.
Two of them do not share the quality of producing blue flowers in mineral- rich soils.
Allow me to introduce our American visitors.
I must ask you to forgive their somewhat lackadaisical manners, but I have conditioned them, or brainwashed them, which I understand is the new American word, to believe that they are waiting out a storm in the lobby of a small hotel in New Jersey where a meeting of the ladies' garden club is in progress.
You will notice that I have told them they may smoke.
I' ve allowed my people to have a little fun in the selection of bizarre tobacco substitutes!
Are you enjoying your cigarette, Ed?
Yes, ma' am.
Yak dung.
Oh... "Tastes good...
like a cigarette should! "
Now then, comrades...
May I present the famous Raymond Shaw.
Young man, you' ve flown 8, 000 miles to this dreary spot in Manchuria to see.
Raymond, pull your chair over here by me, please.
I am sure you' ve all heard the old wives' tale that no hypnotised subject may be forced to do that which is repellent to his moral nature, whatever that may be.
Nonsense, of course!
Oh, you note- takers might set down a reminder to consult Brenman' s paper,
"Experiments in the Hypnotic Production of Antisocial and Self- Injurious Behaviour", or Wells' 1941 paper which was titled,
I believe, "Experiments in the Hypnotic Production of Crime".
Or, of course, Andrew Salter' s remarkable book, "Conditioned Reflex Therapy", to name only three.
Or, if it offends you that only the West is working to manufacture more crime and better criminals
Against the modern shortages,
I suggest Krasnogorski' s "Primary Violence Motivation", or Serov' s "The Unilateral Suggestion to Self- Destruction".
My dear Yen, as you grow older, you grow more long- winded.
Can' t we get to the point?
Has the man ever killed anyone, or has he not?
I apologise, my dear Dimitri.
I keep forgetting that you' re a young country and your attention span is limited.
Tell me, Raymond.
Have you ever killed anyone?
- No, ma' am.
- Not even in combat?
Yes, ma' am, I think so.
Of course you have, Raymond.
Raymond has been a crack shot since childhood.
Marvellous outlet for his aggressions.
May I have the bayonet, please?
With the hands.
With the hands?
- The least?
- That' s right.
I guess Captain Marco, ma' am.
Notice how he is always drawn to authority?
That won' t do, Raymond.
We need the Captain to get you your medal.
Who else?
Well, I guess Ed Mavole, ma' am.
That' s better.
Now then, Raymond.
Take this scarf and strangle Ed Mavole, uh, to death.
Yes, ma' am.
Pardon me.
Hey, Sarge, cut it out!
Quiet, Ed, please!
Now, you just sit there quietly and cooperate.
Yes, ma' am.
Major, to your knowledge, have any other ex- members of your patrol had similar dreams?
Not to my knowledge.
Doesn' t it strike anyone as curious that
Mavole was one of the two men lost in the action, and yet every night in my dream, he' s the... he' s the one that Raymond...
I' m sorry, gentlemen.
Now, Major Marco.
Since you first brought your recurring dream to our attention,
Raymond Shaw, his life, background, habits, friends and associates have been under scrupulous examination.
The facts speak for themselves.
His stepfather is a United States senator.
His mother is head of 15 different patriotic organisations.
Raymond Shaw is confidential assistant to Holborn Gaines, our most respected political journalist.
- It' s inconceivable...
- Major Marco.
As the consulting psychiatrist,
I' d like to hear your personal feelings about Shaw.
Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I' ve ever known.
I see.
This opinion, Major, was it generally held?
His fellow soldiers, did they feel the same way toward him?
Why shouldn' t they?
He saved their lives.
Mr Secretary!
Mr Secretary!
Can you explain the proposed cut in budget?
Since you' ve asked a simple- minded question,
I will give you an equally simple- minded answer.
Hence the cut in budget.
Major, my time is important.
How much longer must we go on with this nonsense?
If there are no further questions for the secretary, I think that wraps things up.
I have a question, sir.
I am United States Senator John Yerkes Iselin, and I have a question so serious that the safety of our nation may well depend on your answer.
No evasions, Mr Secretary!
No evasions, if you please, sir.
What the hell are you talking about?
What kind of foolishness is this?
I' m new at this job, but it' s not good to talk that way to a US Senator - even if he is an idiot.
I am United States Senator John Yerkes Iselin, and I have here a list of the names of 207 persons who are known by the Secretary of Defense as being members of the Communist Party!
What?!
Who are still, nevertheless, working at shaping the policy of the Defense Department!
- Senator who?
- I demand an answer, Mr Secretary!
- What?
- No covering up.
How did you get in here in the first place?!
Major, throw that lunatic out of here!
I deeply regret having to say in front of these ladies and gentlemen...
You claim you' re a defender?
Of our great country that you no longer have my confidence, sir!
You' re an idiot, if you ask me!
You' re out of your mind no longer a matter for investigation by the Defense Department!
- You have lost your chance, sir.
- Get that man out of this room!
This matter is now the responsibility of the United States Senate.
Get him out of this room!
Not ever!
If I ever catch you in this room again, I' il throw you out bodily.
Don' t you take my picture any more!
Senator!
Senator Iselin.
I' d like to verify that number, sir.
How many Communists did you say?
Oh, Major, I said there are exactly...
I have absolute proof there are 104 card- carrying Communists in the Defense Department.
- 275.
And that' s all I have to say on the subject now.
- Come, babe.
- Major, how many did he say?
Excuse me just a moment.
Boys, please.
Major, how many did he say?
- Very good, Raymond.
- Thank you, ma' am.
Captain Marco?
- Yes, ma' am?
- On your feet, Captain, please!
- Captain...
When you are returned with your patrol to Korea and you go to Command Headquarters, what will be the first duty you will undertake?
I will make my report on the patrol, ma' am.
What will you report?
I will recommend urgently that Raymond Shaw be posted for the Medal of Honor.
He saved our lives and took out a complete company of Chinese infantry.
A complete company?
What the hell is this?
We can spare an imaginary company of infantry for this particular plan, Mikhail Mikanich.
All right.
We don' t object, comrade.
I assure you of that.
However, comrade, we thank you for thinking of the matter in that light.
If we may proceed with the demonstration?
Raymond.
Who' s that little fellow sitting next to the captain?
That' s Bobby Lembeck.
Our mascot, I guess you' d call him.
Doesn' t look old enough to be in your army.
I guess he isn' t, but there he is, ma' am.
Captain Marco, would you be good enough to lend Raymond your pistol?
Yes, ma' am.
- Thanks, Ben.
- Sure, kid.
Shoot Bobby, Raymond.
Through the forehead.
Honey!
Honey!
Wake up, wake up!
Wake up, it' s all right.
It' s all right!
It' s all right.
All right.
It' s all right.
That same dream again?
I must be going crazy!
- You want to write to Sergeant Shaw.
- I tell you, nothing' s wrong with me!
Ask him if anyone else is having dreams like yours.
- Yeah?
Maybe I will.
Yeah.
Maybe I' il do that.
If anybody can help me, he can!
You like him a lot, don' t you?
Raymond Shaw is the bravest, kindest, warmest, most wonderful human being I' ve ever known.
Dear Sarge.
I had to say this or write this to someone because I think I' m going nuts.
And since you were my best friend in the army, here goes.
Sarge, I' m in trouble.
I' m afraid to go to sleep because I have terrible dreams.
I dream about all the guys on the patrol where you won the medal.
Well, it' s pretty rough, you have to take my word for that.
- Raymond Shaw, please.
- This is he.
Raymond.
Why don' t you pass the time by playing a little solitaire?
- Raymond.
- Yes, sir.
- Can you see the red queen?
- Yes, sir.
Good.
One week from next Saturday, you will be called for at 11. 10am and taken to the Timothy Swardon Sanitarium, 84 East 61st Street.
We want you there for a checkup.
Is that clear.
Yes, sir.
You may put the cards away now.
Goodbye, Raymond.
Mr Gaines.
It' s Mr Shaw.
He was run down in the street by a hit- and- run driver.
- It just came over the AP.
- Good heavens!
Find out what hospital he' s in and call them.
See if there' s anything we can do to help.
You' re welcome.
Bye.
That was Mr Gaines from his newspaper.
He said to tell him to take it easy and not to worry about a thing.
Which of course you will not tell him on the chance it is some sort of prearranged code.
- Comrade Zilkov?
- Yes?
Yen Lo.
Pavlov Institute.
Doctor.
You may go.
When did you arrive?
Revolting journey.
Ah, Raymond.
It' s nice to see you again.
It' s nice to see you again, sir.
In case there are any visitors.
Although I cannot imagine who will visit Raymond.
- Attractive flat you have here.
- Thank you, Doctor.
We were able to purchase it three years ago.
Profit?
Fiscal year?
The virus of capitalism is highly infectious.
Soon, you' il be lending money out at interest!
You must try, Comrade Zilkov, to cultivate a sense of humour.
Tell me, Raymond.
Do you remember murdering Mavole and Lembeck?
I beg your pardon, sir?
Mavole and Lembeck.
The men who were lost on the patrol.
Can you recall what happened to them?
It was a very clear action for a night action.
Captain Marco sent up some low flares, so it was easy to see what was happening.
Bobby Lembeck got separated to the left.
Mavole went after him.
They were killed instantly by a high mortar shell.
I don' t think they ever knew what hit 'em.
Do you realise, comrade, the implications of the weapon that has been placed at your disposal?
You may remove your head bandage, Raymond.
Without memory of his deed, he cannot possibly feel guilt.
Nor will he, of course, have any reason to fear being caught.
Having been relieved of those uniquely American symptoms, guilt and fear, he cannot possibly give himself away.
Our Raymond will remain an outwardly normal, productive, sober and respected member of the community.
His brain has not only been washed, as they say, it has been dry- cleaned.
Thank you, Raymond.
- Of course.
It will take about a week, working between visiting hours, to check the mechanism out.
It' s been, after all, two years since the conditioning took place.
Where are you going?
I had thought to spend the afternoon at Macy' s.
Madame Yen has given me the most appalling list.
I personally guarantee it.
He is ready to be turned over to his American operator.
Very well, then.
I' m shocked that a security officer with the responsibility you hold would risk a mechanism as valuable as Raymond out of sheer nervousness.
I assure you, Doctor, conditions offering minimum risk can be arranged.
All right.
If you insist on this foolishness, have him kill one of your people in here.
I would, I would gladly.
Why can' t we be reasonable about this?
All right.
All right, Doctor!
Whom do you think he should kill?
With humour, my dear Zilkov!
Always with a little humour.
Holborn Gaines?
With Mr Gaines out of the way, might he not then be given that very influential job himself?
Who' s there?
It' s me, Mr Gaines.
Raymond.
I' m sorry to disturb you, sir.
It was my wife' s.
It' s the warmest thing I have.
Perfect for reading in bed at night.
- She died nearly six years ago.
What the devil are you doing here at 4am?
Anyway, I thought you were in the hospital?
Oh, now, don' t tell me that you' ve come here at this ridiculous hour to talk something over?
No, sir.
- Who told you I' d be asleep?
- They did.
"They"?
Who' s this mysterious "they"?
Raymond?
Answer me, my boy.
- Colonel!
- Ben.
Oh, please do.
Of course.
Come on in.
May I ask the Colonel:
And (b) may I mix you a drink?
(a) Yes, it is, and (b) you certainly may.
- Scotch all right?
My God, where' d ya get all the books?
I...
- Water all right?
San Francisco.
A little bookstore out there.
And, uh... he ships' em to me, wherever I happen to be stationed.
- Have you read them all?
- Yeah.
They' d also make great insulation against an enemy attack.
- Ben.
- Sir.
The army' s got a lot of things wrong with it, but it does take care of its own people, which is why I' m here.
As a public relations officer, you' re a disaster.
I never wanted the job.
You permitted the secretary to make unfortunate remarks to that idiot, Iselin, which started him off on a rampage.
Listen to me, please.
For months, I' ve been driven out of my mind by a recurring dream.
The medical officer...
What the hell does the Medical Corps know about intelligence work?
I tell you, there' s something phoney about me, about Raymond Shaw, about the whole Medal of Honor business.
Really hear?
I said Raymond Shaw is the kindest, warmest, bravest, most wonderful human being I' ve ever known.
And even now I feel that way, and yet, somewhere in the back of my mind, something tells me it' s not true.
It' s just not true.
It isn' t as if Raymond' s hard to like.
He' s impossible to like!
I' ve ever known in my whole... all of my life.
What I came to tell you is Public Relations has bounced you back to me.
And in your present state, there' s no possible way I can use you.
As of this moment, I' m placing you on sick leave.
Go away, Ben.
Find yourself a girl.
Lie in the sun.
I absolutely refuse.
You don' t seem to understand.
What I' ve just told you is not a suggestion, Major.
It is an order.
Yes, sir.
Good night, Ben.
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Not at all.
Please do.
Maryland' s a beautiful state.
- This is Delaware.
- I know.
I was one of the Chinese workmen who the laid the track on this stretch.
But, um... nonetheless, Maryland is a beautiful state.
So is Ohio, for that matter.
I guess so.
Columbus is a tremendous football town.
- You in the railroad business?
However, if you will permit me to point out, when you ask that question, you should say "Are you in the railroad line?"
Where' s your home?
I' m a major.
I' ve been in the army most of my life.
We move a good deal.
I was born in New Hampshire.
I went to a girls' camp once on Lake Frances.
It' s pretty far north.
What' s your name?
Eugénie.
- Pardon?
- No kidding.
I really mean it.
Crazy French pronunciation and all.
- It' s pretty.
- Well, thank you.
I guess your friends call you Jenny.
Not yet, they haven' t.
For which I am deeply grateful.
But you may call me Jenny.
What do your friends call you?
- Rosie.
- Why?
My full name is Eugénie Rose.
Of the two names, I' ve always favoured Rosie, because it smells of brown soap and beer.
Eugénie is somehow more fragile.
Still, when I asked you what your name was, you said it was Eugénie.
It' s quite possible I was feeling more or less fragile at that instant.
I could never figure out what that phrase meant, "more or less".
- No.
My name is Ben.
It' s really Bennett.
I was named after Arnold Bennett.
The writer?
No.
A lieutenant colonel.
He was my father' s commanding officer at the time.
- What' s your last name?
Major Marco.
Are you Arabic?
No.
No...
Let me put it another way.
Are you married?
No.
- You?
- No.
- Chaney.
I' m production assistant for a man named Justin, who had two hits last season.
I live on 54th Street, a few doors from the Modern Museum of Art, of which I' m a tea- privileges member.
I live at 53 West 54th Street.
Can you remember that?
Yes.
Eldorado 59970.
Can you remember that?
Yes.
Are you stationed in New York?
Or is stationed the right word?
I' m not exactly stationed in New York.
I was... stationed in Washington, but...
I got sick and now I' m on leave and I' m gonna spend it in New York.
Eldorado 59970.
I' m gonna look up an old friend of mine who' s a newspaper man.
We were in Korea together.
Mr Shaw, there' s a gentleman outside to see you.
- A gentleman?
- An Oriental gentleman, sir.
He said he was in the army with you.
He is very insistent, sir.
All right, all right.
Show him in.
I am Chunjin, Mr Shaw, sir.
I was interpreter at 32 Charlie Company.
52nd Regiment.
You were the guide and interpreter to the patrol.
Yes, sir, Mr Shaw.
What can I do for you?
I mean to say, what are you doing here?
Your father did not say to you?
- My father?
- Yes.
Senator Iselin.
Senator Iselin is not my father.
Repeat, he is not my father.
If you learn nothing else on your visit to this country, memorise that fact.
I write to Senator Iselin.
I tell him how I interpret your outfit.
I tell him I want to come to America.
He get me visa.
Now I need job.
- A job?
- Yes, sir, Mr Shaw.
But my dear fellow, we don' t need interpreters here.
I am tailor and mender.
I am cook.
I drive car.
I am cleaner and scrubber.
I fix anything.
I take message.
I sleep at house of my cousin.
I ask for job with you because you are great man who save my life.
I could use a valet, I think.
A good cook, I mean.
I will pay you $60 a week.
You will have every Thursday and every other Sunday off.
Thank you, Mr Shaw.
I' m leaving for Washington in a minute.
I' il be back this evening by 8. 30.
I would like to have dinner waiting.
Yes, sir, Mr Shaw.
Oh, God, I hope not.
You' il be marvellous in there this afternoon, hon.
I just know you are.
There' s just one thing, babe.
I' d be a lot happier if we could just settle on the number of Communists
I know there are in the Defense Department.
I mean, the way you keep changing the figures on me all the time, it makes me look like some kind of a nut, like... like an idiot.
The boys are even starting to kid me about it.
Just yesterday in the cloakroom, they said "Hey, Johnny..."
You' il look like an even bigger idiot if you don' t get in there
- Babe...
Who are they writing about all over this country and what are they saying?
"Are there any Communists in the Defense Department?"
They' re saying "How many Communists are there?"
So stop talking like an expert all of a sudden and get out there and say what you' re supposed to say!
Ah, come on, babe.
I...
I' m sorry, hon.
Would it really make it easier for you if we settled on just one number?
Yeah.
Just one real simple number that will be easy for me to remember.
There are exactly 57 card- carrying members of the Communist Party in the Department of Defense at this time!
Point of order, Mr Speaker.
Point of order!
What was Raymond doing with his hands?
How did the old ladies turn into Russians?
What was Raymond doing with his hands?
How did the old ladies turn into Russians?
What was Raymond doing with his hands?
What were you doing there?
What was Raymond doing with his hands?!
What were you doing there?!
I know.
And thank you.
Thank you very much.
I' ve got to find Raymond.
Maybe he' s home by now.
All right, darling, whatever you want.
But first, I have something to tell you.
You know what I was doing when you so cleverly had the police call me?
Don' t bother trying to guess.
You' re too tired.
I' il tell you what I was doing.
After I dropped you off, I went straight home, and when I got upstairs...
- Apartment 3B.
- That' s right.
Very good!
Before I even took my coat off, I telephoned my fiancé.
I told you I wasn' t married.
I never said I wasn' t engaged.
Well, I called up my fiancé, and he came over as soon as he could, which was instantly.
And I told him I had just met you... and I gave him his ring back.
At the police station, they told me you had beaten up a large Chinese gentleman.
Korean.
At least I think he was Korean.
A very large Korean gentleman.
But that you were a pretty solid type, according to Washington - with whom they' d checked.
I figured if they went to the trouble to contact George Washington, you must be somebody very important indeed.
I must say, it was rather sweet of the General, with you only a Major.
I didn' t even know you knew him.
Oh yes, indeed, my darling Ben.
They could have asked me, and I would have told them.
- Hi, kid.
- What in the hell' s going on?
Yeah, well
- You see, Chunjin...
- My God, you look terrible.
I mean, I' ve never seen you look so awful.
Raymond...
I wanna tell you that I' ve been having this terrible nightmare.
I' ve been in the army 19 years.
First time I' ve ever seen one of these.
I' ve been having this nightmare.
A real swinger of a nightmare, too.
It' s to do with, uh... all kinds of strange people.
How did you know that?
How do you know?!
Take your hands off me.
Please, Raymond.
Tell me, how did you know?
I don' t really know anything about it at all.
But you just started to tell me...
Do you remember Al Melvin, the corporal on the patrol?
- Yes, of course.
- I had a letter from him two weeks ago.
Needless to say, I was very surprised to hear from him.
You know how much the guys in the outfit hated me.
Well, not as much as I hated them.
Well, anyway, the funny thing was, he wrote that I was the best friend he had in the army.
The poor, simple boob.
Anyway, he wanted to tell me about his nightmare.
He said he was going out of his mind.
Anyway, what' s so much of a nightmare about that?
The letter.
Have you got the letter?
No, I don' t.
I never keep letters.
That' s all he wrote?
That was the end of it?
Why?
Is it the same thing you' ve been dreaming?
Raymond, do something for me, will you?
If a young lady answers, tell her I' ve gone to Washington.
The town, not the General.
I' il be in touch with her as quickly as I can.
You' il do that, won' t you?
Eldorado 59970.
To take some of the mystery out of it, Major, the photographs you see are shots of male models, Mexican circus performers,
Czech research chemists,
Japanese criminals,
French head waiters, Turkish wrestlers, pastoral psychiatrists.
Hold the one on the right, please!
Hold this one too, please.
Exactly one hour ago, your friend Mr Alan Melvin in Wainright, Alaska made the same two photographs.
His moustache was a little thinner then.
He was about 5' 11 ", on the heavy side.
Uniformed as a lieutenant general.
His staff were dressed in civilian clothes.
They looked like FBI men.
His name is Berezovo.
He' s a member of the Central Committee.
They wore political markings.
All right, Ben.
I' m going to recommend setting up a joint intelligence ClA/ FBI unit, based out of New York.
You' il work with them, representing the army.
- Your assignment' s Raymond Shaw.
- Very good, Colonel.
My mother, Ben, is a terrible woman.
A terrible, terrible woman.
Chunjin!
We would like some more wine.
Chunjin!
Oh, I forgot.
After you called, I gave Chunjin the night off, because it was Christmas Eve, I told him.
He was very reluctant to go.
That' s probably because he' s a Buddhist and he doesn' t celebrate Christmas.
I don' t think that Chunjin is a Buddhist.
He smiles all the time.
Oh, what a shame.
I thought he was a Buddhist, or I would have sent him a Christmas card.
But I figured that if I sent him a card at this time of the year, that he would have to send me a card on the Buddha' s birthday.
- To save face, right?
- Oh, right.
- That would have started a big megillah.
- Exactly.
That' s...
You did exactly the right thing.
12 days of Christmas.
One day of Christmas is loathsome enough.
What were we saying?
Oh, yes.
My mother.
Of course I do.
I' m interested.
It' s rather like listening to Orestes gripe about Clytemnestra.
- Who?
- Greeks.
A couple of Greeks in a play.
Oh.
Well, you know, Ben... it' s a terrible thing to hate your mother.
But I didn' t always hate her.
When I was a child, I only kind of disliked her.
But after what she did to Jocie and me, that' s when I began to hate her.
Jocie?
Jocie Jordan.
Senator Jordan' s daughter.
That' s pretty funny, isn' t it?
Thomas Jordan' s daughter and Johnny Iselin' s stepson.
That' s her.
Jocie.
- She' s lovely.
- I always keep her picture.
Years later, I realised, Ben, that...
I' m not very loveable.
No, no.
Don' t contradict me.
I am not loveable.
Some people are loveable and other people are not loveable.
I am not loveable.
Oh, but I was very loveable with Jocie.
In a way.
Then, of course, my mother fixed all that.
Ben, you don' t blame me for hating my mother, do you?
L- I' m not making excuses.
It was the summer, just before I went into the army, and I was bitten by this snake.
- Are you following me?
- I am.
Because you' re not supposed to move - it makes the poison circulate.
When, unexpectedly, there she was, with a razor blade in her hand.
My daddy' s gonna be so pleased about this!
He' s absolutely scared tiddly about snakes in this part of the country.
I mean, I think he' s just uncomplicatedly afraid of snakes.
You don' t happen to have a handkerchief?
Of course you don' t!
Oh, well.
Seriously, Daddy is going to be just thrilled about this.
I promise you one thing.
It may be a little uncomfortable for you, but it' s gonna absolutely make his summer!
Now you just lie very still.
Don' t move.
That' s very important.
Very lucky!
If I were to tell you the statistics on death by snakebite every year...
But in this case, I think...
There' s no swelling above or below.
Normal.
You are not by any chance a mute, are you?
- No, sir.
- Oh.
Well...
- I want to thank you very much, Miss...?
Miss Jocelyn Jordan.
- Hi.
And now, according to the quaint local custom, it' s your turn to tell us what your name is.
- My name is Raymond Shaw, sir.
- How do you do, Raymond?
Is your place near here, Raymond?
It' s that red house just across the lake.
- The Iselin house?
- My house.
It was my father' s.
He left it to me.
We were told that that was the summer camp of Senator Iselin.
Johnny stays there sometimes, sir, when he gets too drunk for Mother to allow him to be seen in Washington.
So, to be on the safe side...
Mrs Iselin is your mother?
My name is Thomas Jordan.
Senator Thomas Jordan.
Well...
- Yes, Raymond?
You just cannot believe, Ben, how...
All summer long, we were together.
I was loveable.
Jocie was loveable.
The Senator was loveable.
The days were loveable, the nights were loveable.
And everybody was loveable.
Except, of course, my mother.
Raymond?
- What is it, Mother?
What do you want?
- About what?
I want to talk to you about that Communist tart.
Shut up with that, Mother!
Shut up!
You know what Jordan is.
Are you out to crucify me?
I don' t know what you mean and I don' t want to know.
- I' m going to bed.
- Raymond.
How would you see her?
- I' m getting a job in New York.
- You have your army service.
I might be dead by next spring.
Raymond.
If we were at war, and you were to become infatuated with the daughter of a Russian agent, wouldn' t you expect me to come to you and object and beg you to stop the entire thing before it was too late?
Well, we are at war.
I will go with you to Washington, tomorrow, if you like, and I will show you proof that this man stands for evil, that he is evil.
That his whole life is devoted to undermining everything that you and I and every freedom- minded American...
She always does.
I could never beat her.
I wrote a letter...
Or she wrote it and I signed it - I can' t even remember which.
It was a terrible, vile, disgusting letter.
I n...
I never saw her again.
God knows, Ben, I...
I' m not loveable, but I loved her.
I did love her.
Come on, kid.
It' s time for you to call it a night.
Come on.
So this lousy brother- in- law of mine,
I say to him "You think you' re a poker player?"
- Beer, please.
So I says to him "My advice to you, from the bottom of the heart:
Don' t play poker. "
"If I was you, I' d get myself another line of action."
"Why don' t you pass the time by playing a little solitaire?"
Give me a deck of cards, please.
I got no idea that this guy comes in the same package, that it' s a package deal, and for eleven long years, I got this crumb tied around my neck.
And believe me, it' s no bargain.
You got no idea...
Sorry I' m late, kid.
Got held up in traffic, you know.
So I says to him "Do me a favour."
Hey!
Raymond!
Raymond!
Get out of there!
What are you doing?!
- Hi, Ben.
- What' s the matter with you?
I don' t know.
I was with you at the bar and you were playing solitaire.
Do you remember that?
You bolted out, jumped in a cab, drove here and jumped into the water!
I don' t remember, Ben.
Wait a minute.
In the dream...
You were...
Of course!
Black seven on the red eight.
Let' s discard the various number systems and concentrate on the face cards.
- Thanks a lot.
Because of their symbolic identification with human beings.
Based on Raymond' s psychiatric pattern,
I think we can safely eliminate jacks and kings.
Black six on the red seven.
Why don' t you try for a while?
Human fish swimming in the ocean of atmosphere develop psychic injuries as they collide with one another.
Most mortal of all are those gotten from the parent fish.
Queen of diamonds on the black king.
Hey!
What are you doing?
- I remember.
I remember.
I can see that Chinese cat standin 'there smilin' like Fu Manchu and saying
"The queen of diamonds is reminiscent in many ways of Raymond' s dearly loved and hated mother."
"And is the second key to clear the mechanism for any other assignment."
Jimmy, a little chalky under the chin.
Hon, I can' t tell you how worried I am about Raymond.
- Raymond?
What Raymond?
Your stepson.
May I ask what you find so amusing?
Who could you possibly find who would marry Raymond?
You remember her?
Raymond was so attracted to that summer at the lake.
- Oh, yeah.
- All right!
- I was a bit hasty.
- Same with the hairline.
I now think she would make Raymond an excellent wife.
She' s been living in Paris for the past two years.
But, babe, I thought that you and Senator...
I keep telling you not to think!
You' re very, very good at a great many things, but thinking, hon, just simply isn' t one of them.
Just keep shouting "point of order" into the television cameras
- and I will handle the rest.
- Jimmy.
- Bourbon.
Water.
Sometimes I think you came to us from another century.
Yes, ma' am.
- Raymond.
- Mother.
- May I ask a question?
- Of course.
What are you doing here?
- Why are we having our annual meeting?
- I don' t know what you mean.
When you announced you were coming to lunch,
Not at all.
This is a purely social event.
- However...
- Ah!
As you may or may not have heard,
Johnny and I are giving an enormous party.
I wondered if you' d like to attend.
Have you gone out of your mind?
The reason I ask is because it' s in honour of an old friend of yours
- and her father.
- What old friend?
Do you remember a darling girl we met before you went into the army,
Jocelyn Jordan, Senator Jordan' s daughter?
She' s been abroad for several years.
She arrived back in New York a week or so ago.
And I thought, considering the rather shabby way you treated her, it might be a rather gracious gesture if I gave her a coming- home party.
Jocie and her father?
Of course.
Once I explained to her you would be there.
It' s all right, it' s Polish caviar.
Johnny, come over here, hon.
- Great.
- Thank you.
See you later.
- Where is she?
Have they come?
Are you sure they' re coming, Mother?
Go and get yourself a drink or a tranquilliser.
- Ah, she' s just kiddin '.
Ray, you look great!
What are you supposed to be?
One of those Dutch skaters?
Raymond, dear.
I guarantee it.
Raymond, why don' t we just sneak away for a few minutes, sit down somewhere quietly and have a drink?
- Mother...
Mother, how did she sound?
- Like a girl!
Raymond... why don' t you pass the time by playing a little solitaire?
Tom!
Tom, boy!
So great you could come!
I am here at this Fascist rally because my daughter has assured me that it was important to her that I come.
- There is no other reason.
- Good old Tom!
Raymond.
We feel...
What is it?!
It' s me, babe.
Tom Jordan' s here.
I need you.
I' il be right out!
- Who' s in there with you, anyway?
- Raymond.
Hurry it up, will you?
We' ve got work to do out here.
I' il take this one with me, dear.
- It might bring mischief if I leave it.
- Yes, Mother.
I' il be back as soon as I can.
I' ve been watching you through the window.
When I saw you, my heart almost shot out of my body.
I sent Daddy round the front way.
I had to see you alone.
That was cute!
Come on, lover!
Now, why don' t you just take that somewhere very quietly and drink it?
But, babe, I...
Run along.
The grown- ups have to talk.
How good of you to come, Tom.
I have explained to your husband why I am here.
Tom, I know you have very strong personal feelings about Johnny and me.
What I would like to find out is how strong they really are.
To put it as simply as possible, if Johnny' s name were proposed at the convention next week, would you attempt to block him?
- You' re joking, of course.
- Mr Stevenson makes jokes.
I do not.
You' re seriously trying for the nomination for Johnny?
We couldn' t make it.
But I think he has a good chance for the second spot.
I' ve answered your question, but you haven' t answered mine.
- What question?
- Will you block us?
Will I block you?
I would spend every cent I own and all I could borrow to block you.
But I do not.
I despise John Iselin and everything that Iselinism has come to stand for.
I think if John Iselin were a paid Soviet agent, he could not do more to harm this country than he' s doing now.
Very well, I' il answer you.
If you attempt to deal with the delegates, or cause Johnny' s name to be brought forward on the ticket, or if in my canvass of the delegates tomorrow by telephone
I find that you are so acting,
I will bring impeachment proceedings against your husband on the floor of the United States Senate.
And I will hit him, I promise you, with everything in my well- documented book.
For one million bucks... pick a card.
- Oh, Bennie, card tricks.
If I' d known...
- Oh, come on, pick a card.
Queen of diamonds.
That' s pretty good.
How did you do that?
This is what is known, my dear girl, as a forced deck.
This deck of cards is often employed by a professional magician to simplify his problem of guessing the card picked by the little old lady also employed by army intelligence officers who...
Rosie.
Let' s get married.
- We certainly are in good spirits tonight.
- Yes, we are.
Tomorrow' s the big day.
Lunch with Raymond, a nice little game of solitaire and a nice long chat about the good old days in Korea and some old Chinese and Russian friends of ours.
All over.
- What' s the matter?
Don' t you want to?
- Want to what?
Get married.
Why don' t you pay attention to me when I speak to you?
Oh, Bennie.
I want to marry you more than I want to go on eating Italian food, which will give you some idea.
Well, then, why don' t we get with it, kiddo?
You know, arranging for the papers, for the blood tests, posting the bans.
Figure out what we' re gonna name the kids.
Renting the rice, buy the ring, call the folks.
- You neither?
Orphan?
I used to believe that as a baby, I was the sole survivor of a spaceship crash.
Very sexy stuff.
Very, very sexy.
- Ben!
- Hello, Raymond.
Ben, I want...
I want you to meet Jocie.
Remember I told you about her?
This is my friend, Major Ben Marco.
- Miss Jordan.
- How do you do, Major?
Only it' s Mrs Shaw now.
Mrs Raymond Shaw.
We flew to Maryland last night.
We got married.
We just got back.
Aren' t you gonna pop champagne?
Or at least kiss the bride?
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
My God, Ben.
Isn' t she beautiful?
Isn' t she?
And am I not the luckiest guy in the whole world?
You don' t have to answer that!
Raymond...
There must be some beer or champagne or eye drops or some anchovies in the icebox.
Crack open whatever it is.
Come on, bustle.
Make like a housewife!
I' il get out of this idiot suit.
Ben!
Ben, you should have seen the judge' s face!
There we were, the queen of diamonds and me
looking like, I dunno, Gaucho Marx.
Ben...
Ben, I just made a joke.
Not a very good joke, I admit, but a joke.
In all the years that you' ve known me, have you ever heard me make a joke?
Gaucho Marx.
Me!
Big day!
Mark that down in your book.
Raymond Shaw got married and he made a joke.
Gaucho Marx.
Queen of diamonds.
What did he mean, the queen of diamonds?
My costume.
I came to this costume party as the queen of diamonds.
I couldn' t think what to wear, then I saw this playing card...
- Mrs Shaw...
- Oh, please, Major.
Jocie.
You call me Jocie, I' il call you Ben.
Mrs Shaw.
Jocie.
The reason I came here is to ask Raymond to voluntarily put himself under arrest.
What?
Maybe not under arrest.
That' s pretty strong.
Questioning?
What kind of questioning?
Raymond is sick, Mrs Shaw, in a kind of a special way.
- Sick?
He' s not sick!
You can tell by just looking at him.
That' s not the kind of sick I mean.
Well, you' re wrong, Ben.
You' re wrong.
He' s tied up inside in a thousand knots, I know that, but... you can see for yourself how he is with me.
Oh, God.
We were married just six hours ago.
We' ve been in cars and offices and aeroplanes ever since.
What were your...
What are your plans?
There' s an inn - the Bedford House - near Bedford village.
It' s about an hour from here.
We' ve wired for a room.
Ben...
I can make him well.
I' il give you 48 hours.
I' il talk to him then.
After that, we' il see.
Thank you, Ben.
Thank you and God bless you.
Darling.
Nothing.
Just... darling.
My dear girl.
Have you noticed that the human race is divided into two distinct and irreconcilable groups?
The problem is, they usually marry each other, which naturally causes a great deal
Senator Thomas Jordan and Korean war hero Raymond Shaw, stepson of Senator John Iselin.
It appears that this Montague- Capulet note would have little effect on the feud now raging between the two party leaders.
Earlier, Senator Iselin stepped up his charges against the leader of the group attempting to block his nomination.
I now charge this man, Thomas Jordan, with high treason.
And I assure you, the moment the Senate reconvenes,
I shall move for this man Jordan' s impeachment!
And after that, a civil trial
Get dressed.
Go to your father' s house.
Convey my apologies to him.
I' il join you later.
What are you going to do?
Something I should have done a long time ago.
I' m gonna beat that vile, slandering son of a numbskull to a bloody pulp!
Mother!
That vile, slandering husband of yours!
Where is he?
Darling, something important has come up.
There is something you have to do.
Who is it?
- It' s me, sir.
- Raymond, my boy!
Jocie waited up as long as she could.
She turned in about a quarter to two.
Raymond.
I want to offer my congratulations and welcome you to the family.
- Thank you, sir.
Come with me!
Help yourself.
- What the hell is that in your hand?
- It' s a pistol, sir.
- Is that a silencer?
- Yes, sir.
Why are you carrying a pistol?
Daddy, what is it?
Raymond, no!
Raymond, darling!
What is it?
Raymond Shaw shot and killed his wife early this morning.
- But it- it doesn' t say...
- I know.
It wasn' t Raymond that really did it.
In a way, it was me.
As you can well understand, gentlemen, my... my wife is prostrate over the loss of this dear and wonderful girl whom she loved as a daughter.
Your stepson, Senator, where is he?
My...
My son Raymond is in retreat, praying for strength and understanding to try and carry on somehow.
Ben!
It' s for you.
Major Marco.
- Ben.
- Hi, kid.
How could anyone...
Jocie.
- How could it happen?
- Where are you, Raymond?
I...
I think maybe I' m going crazy.
I' m having... terrible dreams like you used to have and...
Where are you?
We can' t talk on the telephone.
Just tell me where you are.
I...
I' m in a... hotel room... across from the Garden.
Eighth Avenue side.
All right.
Listen to me.
Just wait right there.
Don' t move!
OK, I' il take him now.
Everything' s got to move quite normally.
Now, I want him to feel like he' s safe.
Just give me a pack of cards.
They' ve just handed the vice- presidential nomination to that idiot Iselin.
Hi, kid.
Who killed...
Jocie, Ben?
Tell me.
I' ve got to know.
How about passing the time by playing a little solitaire?
- Did you, Raymond?
Did you?
- No.
What happened?
We were worked on for three days by a team of specialists from the Pavlov Institute in Moscow.
Never mind all that.
Not now.
Tell me what else happened at Tonghua.
We were drilled for three days.
What else?
One red queen works pretty good.
Let' s see what we get with two of 'em.
Keep playing.
Then I killed Mr Gaines.
It was just a test.
It didn' t matter who I killed.
They picked him to see if all the linkages still worked before they turned me over to my American operator.
And that business about jumping in the lake, it really did happen.
It was an accident.
Something somebody said in the bar accidentally triggered it.
Keep playing!
Then I... killed Senator Jordan.
And after that...
Forget everything that happened at the Senator' s house, do you understand?
You' il only remember it when I tell you so.
You forget about it, do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Now, Raymond...
Now the big one.
Why...
Why is all of this being done?
What have they built you to do?
I don' t know.
I don' t think anybody really knows, except
Berezovo in Moscow... and my American operator here.
But whatever it is, it' s supposed to happen soon, right at the convention.
I don' t know.
They can make me do anything, Ben, can' t they?
We' il see, kid.
We' il see what they can do and we' il see what we can do.
So the red queen is our baby.
Well, take a look at this, kid.
52 of them.
Take a good look at 'em, Raymond.
And while you' re looking, listen.
This is me, Marco, talking.
52 red queens and me are telling you...
You know what we' re telling you?
It' s over!
The links, the beautifully conditioned links are smashed.
They' re smashed as of now because we say so.
Because we say they are to be smashed!
You don' t work any more.
That' s an order.
Yes?
She wants me to go.
I don' t think anything will happen until then.
- I' d better go now.
- Here' s a number.
A thousand if I need them.
You call me at that number.
Try to call me by 8. 30.
Or as soon as you find out whatever it is they want you to do.
I' il be waiting.
Yes, sir.
Raymond.
Remember, Raymond, the wires have been pulled.
They can' t touch you any more.
You' re free.
It' s been decided that you will be dressed as a priest to help you get away in the pandemonium afterwards.
Chunjin will give you a two- piece sniper' s rifle that fits nicely into a special bag.
There' s a spotlight booth that won' t be in use.
It' s up under the roof on the Eighth Avenue side of the Garden.
You will have absolutely clear, protected shooting.
The speech is short.
But it' s the most rousing speech I' ve ever read.
It' s been worked on here and in Russia, on and off, for over eight years.
I shall force someone to take the body away from him.
Then Johnny will really hit those microphones and those cameras, with blood all over him, fighting off anyone who tries to help, defending America even if it means his own death!
Rallying a nation of television viewers into hysteria, to sweep us up into the White House with powers that will make martial law seem like anarchy!
Now, this is very important.
I want the nominee to be dead about two minutes after he begins his acceptance speech, depending on his reading time under pressure.
You are to hit him right at the point that he finishes the phrase
"Nor would I ask of any fellow American in defence of his freedom that which I would not gladly give myself."
"My life before my liberty."
Is that absolutely clear?
Would you repeat it for me, Raymond?
"Nor would I ask of any fellow American
- in defence of his freedom - in defence of his freedom
- that which I would not gladly - that which I would not gladly give
- give myself. "
- Myself. "
- "My life before my liberty."
- "My life before my liberty."
I know you will never entirely comprehend this, Raymond, but you must believe I did not know it would be you.
I served them, I fought for them,
I' m about to win them the greatest foothold they will ever have here, and they paid me back by taking your soul away from you.
I told them to build me an assassin.
I wanted a killer from a world filled with killers, and they chose you because they thought it would bind me closer to them.
But now we have come almost to the end.
One last step, and then, when I take power, they will be pulled down and ground into dirt for what they did to you and what they did in so contemptuously underestimating me!
One, two, three, four, five...
Testing!
Lights.
Lights out!
Lights!
Why hasn' t he called?
It was a calculated risk, Ben.
You were right to take it.
Even if it' s not true, it' s nice of you to say it.
- I know.
- Easy, Ben.
I blew it!
Intelligence Officer!
Stupidity Officer is better!
Well, Raymond was theirs.
There' s time.
He may still call.
For money?
No.
That' s what I figured.
- Let' s go!
- Milt, you gotta stop this thing!
- How can I stop it?
On what evidence?
You' d empty the White House if you had to.
Ladies and gentlemen, our national anthem.?
Oh, say can you see?
By the dawn' s early light?
What so proudly we hailed?
At the twilight' s last gleaming??
Raymond has never missed with a rifle.?
Through the perilous flight?
O' er the ramparts we watched?
Were so gallantly streaming??
And the rockets' red glare?
The bombs bursting in air?
Gave proof through the night?
That our flag was still there?
O' er the land of the free...
- Ladies and gentlemen...
My fellow Americans.
It is with great humility, albeit with enormous pride and with a sense of the job to be done, that I most humbly and most gratefully accept this nomination for the highest office in our land.
It is with a full awareness that the four years that lie ahead for this country are, in a sense, the crucial years.
If I may borrow Mr Churchill' s phrase, the years of decision.
And, if I may be permitted a phrase of my own, the years of striving!
For it is not what has been done in the past, nor what may be done against the far horizons of some distant future, but what will be done now!
Nor would I ask of any fellow American in defence of his freedom
that which I would not gladly give myself.
My life before my liberty!
You couldn' t have stopped them.
So I had to.
Oh, God, Ben!
Poor Raymond.
Poor friendless, friendless Raymond.
He was wearing his medal when he died.
You should read some of the citations sometime.
"Wounded five times.
"Holderman."
Made to commit acts too unspeakable to be cited here
by an enemy who had captured his mind and his soul.
He freed himself at last, and in the end, heroically and unhesitatingly, gave his life to save his country.
Raymond Shaw.
Hell!
- We got to get back.
- See ya, Matt.
Come through here.
Strip down.
Open up.
Welcome to Alcatraz.
(BeII rings) (Guard) Inside B and C!
- 25 on inside C, first tier.
- 20 inside B, first tier.
- 23 on inside C, second tier.
- 17 inside B, second tier.
Break out!
Inside B and C.
Move!
Better button your coIlar, boy.
No forks.
Hey, no forks.
Do you see any?
Fresh fish, you want your pasta?
Hey, you want your pasta?
Do you see any?
I see pasta in my sleep.
I' m Litmus.
Like Iitmus paper.
When it' s cold, my face gets blue.
When it' s hot, my face gets red.
Inside C, move out.
Warden wants to see you.
Name?
Morris.
That' s funny.
This file says Frank Lee Morris.
If you disobey the rules of society, they send you to prison.
If you disobey the rules of prison, they send you to us.
Alcatraz is not Iike any other prison in the United States.
Here, every inmate is confined alone to an individuaI ceIl.
Unlike my predecessors, wardens Johnson and BlackweIl,
I don' t have good conduct programs.
I do not have inmate councils.
Inmates have no say in what they do.
They do as they' re told.
You are not permitted to have newspapers or magazines carrying news.
Knowledge of the outside world is what we teII you.
From this day on, your world wiII be everything that happens in this building.
You wiII shave once a day.
You wiII shower twice a week.
You wiII cut your hair once a month.
You can talk.
You can work.
Other institutions hand out work, but here it' s a privilege that you earn.
I promise you it' s a privilege that you' II want.
Visitors - you' re aIlowed two a month.
They cannot be former inmates of this or any other federaI prison.
AII names that you submit wiII be carefuIly checked by the FBl.
What names do you have in mind?
I can' t think of any offhand.
Family members?
None.
No family.
Alcatraz is a maximum security prison with very few privileges.
We don' t make good citizens, but we make good prisoners.
Burglary, armed robbery, grand Iarceny...
You' ve escaped from quite a few prisons, haven' t you?
That' s why you' re here.
Alcatraz was built to keep aII the rotten eggs in one basket, and I was speciaIly chosen to ensure that the stink from the basket does not escape.
Since I' ve been warden some have tried to escape.
Most have been recaptured.
Those who haven' t have been kiIled or drowned in the bay.
No one has ever escaped from Alcatraz.
And no one ever wiIl.
Sure.
Even to bed together.
And when I wash, he washes.
Capisce?
I' m Wolf.
Where did they transfer you from?
Atlanta.
Nice town, Atlanta.
I never saw it.
I' m Iooking for a... new punk.
Good Iuck.
You don' t understand.
I just found her.
Why don' t you show her what you can do?
(Guard) Morris, I need somebody in the Iibrary.
- Take him over there, wiII you?
- Yes, Captain.
What you want, boy?
The buII sent me down here to work.
Can you read... boy?
As Iong as it' s in the English Ianguage, boy.
You treat them aII Iike Wolf?
Wolf wanted to get friendly.
I didn' t.
You' II take that cart to the ceIls.
Don' t they Iet cons down here?
You see any chairs?
How come?
Because this is The Rock, man.
They don' t want you doing anything here... but time... hard friggin 'time.
Rock affects dudes differently.
It either brings out your strength, or it breaks you.
What did it do for you?
What happens when you get out?
I won' t.
I was in this bar in Alabama when two dudes started hassling me.
That was their first mistake.
They puIled knives.
That was their second mistake.
They didn' t know how to use them.
That was the Iast mistake they ever made.
I got two 99- year sentences back- to- back.
Seems Iike you could have pleaded self- defence.
The dudes were white, man, just Iike you.
When I arrived they put me in one of those dark ceIls in D- block.
After a while, I went stir crazy.
Sliced my AchiIles' tendon to get out.
You' II see why when you see D- block.
TeII me something, you through kiIling white guys?
- Why?
I just figured I wouldn' t turn my back on you.
Hey.
What' s your name, man?
Frank.
What' s yours?
English.
See you Iater.
- Your name?
- Morris.
OK.
- Magazine or book?
- Where' s English?
What did they do, give a nigger a nigger of his own?
Magazine?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Magazine?
Thanks.
- Hey, you' re new.
Hey, wait, wait a minute.
I haven' t seen a new guy in six months.
It' s nice to talk.
How are the Brooklyn Dodgers doing?
- Moved to LA two years ago.
- No kidding?
Warden don' t aIlow no books in these ceIls.
How come?
Because there' s no Iight in them.
Better deliver them books, Morris, where they can be read.
Right.
What' s the flower?
That' s something inside me they can' t Iock up with their bars and waIls.
I' m Doc.
You ever paint?
- No.
- Why not?
You scared of dying?
I don' t think so.
You better be.
You hurt Wolf.
Wolf' s going to hurt you.
Where you going, cracker?
Pete.
Something speciaI about those steps?
The higher you sit, the more status you got.
So we play king of the mountain, except here we don' t play for fun, man.
And you' re king?
Yeah.
Now, I figure there' s two reasons why you didn' t sit down on my step.
Either you' re too scared, or you just hate niggers.
Now, which is it, boy?
You too scared?
I just hate niggers.
So no one' s ever busted out.
No one' s ever made it.
Everyone has Iooked for a way, but there ain' t any.
See those hacks?
Most joints have one hack for every seven cons.
There' s one hack for every three cons here.
You start shitting at night instead of in the morning, they ask why.
Let' s say you' re going to try it anyway.
First, you' ve got to get out of the ceIl.
Each bar has six hard smaIler bars set in a steeI tube with extra steeI poured in.
And there ain' t no way to tunneI out, either.
Shit.
This island is solid rock.
See that water?
It' s over a mile swim to Iand.
The currents make it seem Iike 10.
And the water' s so cold it wiII numb your arms in minutes.
Even if you are a good swimmer, you won' t have time to make it.
There are 12 counts every day.
Sometimes I think that' s aII this shit hole is, one Iong count.
We count the hours, the buIls count us, and the king buIls count the counts.
(Whistle blows) (Guard) Inside!
Everybody in!
I' m assigning you a permanent job... the carpentry shop.
It' s a paying job.
- How much?
- 15 cents an hour.
WeIl, I always knew crime would pay.
It' s a job.
See you Iater.
I sleep Iousy, but I sniff the glue.
It helps pass the nights.
Aren' t you afraid they' II shake down your ceIl?
Then I go to the hole.
It' s worth the chance.
I guess anything you want bad enough is worth the chance.
Including busting out?
Hey, maybe there' s a way out.
It' s on top of your head.
The ventilator shafts on top of our block.
How do you get on top of the block?
- Ask the buII for the key.
- Thanks.
Hey, jive dude, where you going?
Summer' s coming on.
It' s getting cooler.
Weather here is as crazy as The Rock.
Maybe crazier.
Mark Twain wrote that the coldest winter he ever spent was summer in San Francisco.
I can...
Wolf' s coming at you.
- Is his hand cupped?
- Yes.
- Which one?
- His right.
Break off!
Drop it, Wolf!
(Guard) Drop it, Wolf.
You Iike D- block, Wolf?
You better, because you' re gonna rot there for a Iong time.
D- block, Morris.
Look, he came at me.
I said D- block.
- When I get out, you' re dead.
- You' II be dead before you get out.
Warden don' t Iike inmates fighting.
Don' t Iike 'em stinking up their ceIls, either.
Lights out!
Go on back to your ceIl.
(Guard) Welcome to Alcatraz.
- Hey, is anybody over there?
- Yeah, me.
- Come out in front and say heIlo.
- I' m busy.
(Toilet flushes)
Don' t worry.
I washed it.
How you doing, neighbour?
I' m Charley Butts.
SmaIlest ceII I ever seen.
- You' II get used to it.
- I don' t think so.
- I don' t Iike Iiving alone in here.
- You' II get used to that, too.
(BeII rings) (Guard) Break out!
Yard time!
Button the coIlar.
Who' s the new fish?
I got him next to me.
- What' s your name?
- Charley Butts.
Charley' s butt?
Butts.
Butts!
Charley Butts.
You got a funny name, kid.
- Yeah?
What' s your name?
- AI Capone.
- Aren' t you dead?
I got too much money.
I' II never die.
- You play poker?
- Not much.
I just Iearned myself.
We' II play tomorrow.
See you Iater, kid.
See you Iater, Al.
I don' t believe I just met AI Capone.
I don' t, either.
- I' m Doc.
- Charley Butts.
How' s the painting going, Doc?
The one of the warden?
It' s nearly finished.
- You painting the warden?
- He' s very inspiring.
Inside.
Everybody in!
Yes, sir?
I want painting privileges taken away from Chester Dalton.
- Doc?
- CeII 233.
What' s the reason?
You' re deputy warden.
You think of one.
When do you want the suspension to begin?
It' s not a suspension.
It' s an elimination.
Right away.
Yes, sir.
Painting privileges have been removed.
Why?
I don' t know.
Painting' s aII I have.
I' m sorry, Doc.
You OK, Doc?
I think there' s something wrong with him.
I' d keep my eye on Doc.
He seems pretty upset.
Cons are always upset about something.
Put your overaIls on.
Mr Zimmerman, I' m making a new table.
I need a hatchet.
Bob, get Doc a hatchet.
Mr Zimmerman!
Can you come over here for a minute?
Get him out of here!
Get him out!
Take him out of here!
Get him out!
Get back to work.
Let' s go!
Move!
Everybody, back to work!
Let' s go!
Here.
Put that in your report.
What were you doing back there, boy?
Why not?
What do you want?
I got Boys Life.
I know some queens who fight over it every month.
Just give me what you got on top there.
I heard about Doc... and I know why he did it.
Somebody took away his painting privileges.
Who?
The warden.
(Warden) Morris.
I hear there was an accident in the shop.
Accident?
Oh, you mean Doc.
Someone didn' t Iike what he was painting, so someone won' t Iet him paint.
Someone should have warned Doc to be carefuI what he paints.
I think you' re absolutely right, sir.
- Isn' t there?
- We have to be careful.
Back in Iine.
Hey, how' s it going, Frank?
If it isn' t the Anglins.
What are you guys doing, just dropping by?
Thought we' d pay you a visit.
Gonna stay Iong?
Not Iong.
Only about 15 or 20 years.
Why The Rock?
We were Ieaving Atlanta when we encountered a minor problem.
- Such as?
- They saw us.
Yeah, that do present a problem.
They shipped us to Leavenworth.
But we didn' t Iike their accommodations, either.
Warden said he knew just the place for us... Alcatraz.
- Is it true no one' s ever escaped?
- So they teII me.
Jesus.
Wonder what I' d be Iike after 15 years here.
You stiII reading that Bible?
Oh, yeah.
It' s opening up aII kinds of new doors.
Some birthday.
When' s your birthday?
I don' t know.
Jeez, what kind of childhood did you have?
Short.
Never thought it' d be Iike this.
What' d you get sent to The Rock for?
Couple of years ago I started stealing cars, for kicks mostly.
I' d seII the parts.
Got sent to the state pen.
You end up in Alcatraz for that?
Not exactly.
A buII there Iiked to push me around.
So when I got out, I went back, and stole his car.
Unfortunately, I drove it across the state Iine, which made it a federaI rap, and I was sent to The Rock.
(Guard) English!
Visitor for you.
Butts, you got a visitor.
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
Probably somebody wants their car back.
HeIlo, Father.
- Why didn' t you say you were coming?
- I was afraid you wouldn' t Iet me.
It' s just hard to see you Iike this.
Your mama' s going to die.
Charley?
When?
WeIl, she' s got a few months.
'Can you caII her?'
We' re not aIlowed to make phone caIls.
You cannot discuss Institution rules.
Stick to your personaI Iife.
This is my personaI Iife!
You getting a kick out of it?
- (Click) - HeIlo?
HeIlo!
I love you, Charley.
Hey, Frank.
Yeah?
If you try to get out, I want in.
Why?
Mystery mounds.
We always have mystery mounds on Wednesday.
I can' t taste it.
I just eat it out of habit.
What' s the movie this weekend?
Oh, some cowboy piece of shit.
(Imitating gangster) Hey, at Ieast they could show us a gangsta movie.
I may have found a way out of here.
You Iooking at something?
The way I figure it, this ceII block' s reaIly getting old.
The moist air corrodes the concrete.
The salt is rusting the metal.
I took a naiI clipper and dug around the griIle at the back of the ceIl.
I can dig that griIle out, and enlarge the hole into the utility corridor to the top of the ceII block and onto the roof.
How wiII we hide the hole?
We tear the ads from magazines... no one wiII miss those... make cardboard, paint griIles on that, and put it in the hole, maybe partiaIly obscure it with a toweI or whatever.
I' ve ordered an accordion to put in front of my hole.
Swann, S.
Grob, P.
Everyone!
You say everyone!
Alright?
Whoa, Taffy!
- Those are the association' s horses.
Hurry up!
Hello.
Help yourself.
There is enough whisky for all of you.
This is enough here to take a bath.
I' il go and get the girls.
If you don' t stop, I' il bend that iron around your head.
It' s all right, ain' t it, Morrison?
I believe it' s you the boys want.
- All of them.
You pay in advance here.
- Cash.
- Or cattle.
I believe you have enough of the association' s cattle to pay for all of us,... without comin 'up for air...... the whole month of July.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Stay with me.
Maybe you understand better the kind of people you' re workin 'for now.
The tragedy, Nate... is you people were in the right... legally.
But they just threw that away.
Oh, my God!
- What' s goin 'on?
- Firin 'squad.
- Who gave that order?
- Canton.
Before I could get to my feet,... she hit on me with a log, bitin 'and stompin'.
Grabbed the little bitch around the neck.
This time I had my knife.
I didn' t stop cuttin 'till I felt the blood runnin'.
Not in here!
I have nothing to say to you.
You better have a guaranteed warrant for every name on that list.
Show me one for the man outside, right now.
Major?
When the fix is equal, then justice must prevail.
Shut up, Billy.
You people make me sick.
Let' s not have any last- minute sentimentalism...... about killing a few thieves and anarchists.
You ever kill a man yourself, Canton?
Mr Champion,... my grandfather was the secretary of war to Harrison.
His brother was a governor of the state of New York.
My brother- in- law is the secretary of state.
And, to you, I represent the full authority...... of the government of the United States and the president.
Fuck him, too.
Bravo, sir!
I' ve had about enough of your shit too, Billy.
You silly son of a bitch!
You were hired to enforce the law.
We are the law.
"Son of a bitch" has always been a favourite expression in this country.
Is that supposed to mean you' re goin 'to Nate?
Ella?
Do you think a woman can' t love two men?
Sure you can.
Why not?
Or three.
But it sure as hell isn' t convenient.
I can manage it.
Can you?
Even after today?
Today was just the beginnin '.
If somethin 'bigger wasn' t comin'?
Everything I have in the world is here.
I can' t just walk out and leave it.
This?
This junk?
Jesus Christ, Ella.
These are just things!
I can buy you all the things you want.
You' il never understand.
Spare me that, will ya?
Christ, the piety of a whore.
- What does piety mean?
- A dumb whore.
- Those are my books.
- I can see what they are.
- Balanced to the penny.
- I don' t care about that now.
I do.
I never cheated on you.
I always made Nate pay.
That was all a nice game, Ella.
But it' s over.
He asked me to marry him.
Ella, I' m askin 'you again to leave.
I' m beggin 'you.
I do care for you.
I' m grateful to you, Jim, for everything.
And I love you...... for it.
Try to believe my feeling for you...... and my debt to you for the... protection...... in the beginning and now remains unchanged.
What else can I tell you?
It is Nate, isn' t it?
You' re a hard man to compliment.
Both of you.
It' s more your country than mine anyway.
Goodbye, Ella.
I' m gonna miss you.
JB.
Have a last drink with me.
I hate gettin 'old.
Why, make yourself at home.
Is everybody here?
Yeah, all except for the idiots who want to fight.
We are not all... anarchists and... criminals here, Averill.
We' re...
We' re storekeepers.
Merchants.
Why' d you come here?
We want you to talk to them.
To offer to help turn in the people on the list.
They have the law on their side.
Even the National Guard can' t help us.
The law is the law.
See, whatever it is, it is.
It' s your job!
You look like a man about to shit a pumpkin, Charlie.
I' m the mayor here.
You' re out now.
You' re fired.
They' re 50 men, Charlie.
Together, you' re 200.
Your hopes are exaggerated.
In the end, they will get it all anyway.
And if it takes 100 years... but they will get it!
But what about right now, Charlie?
Right here.
I...
I' m afraid you' ve misjudged us.
You can' t fire me, Charlie.
But I just quit.
Good morning!
Good mornin '.
Are you takin 'a bath too?
Oh, shit.
- You know him?
- Never seen him before.
How many are in there?
Nate Champion?
We' re wastin 'time here.
- These two don' t matter any more.
- They' re resting the horses anyway.
It' il be good for discipline.
You oughta understand that better than anyone else.
You' re the professional army man.
I' m the amateur.
You go in there... and tell them they' re completely surrounded...... and they must surrender immediately.
If you come back out, we' il hold our fire till you' re clear.
You have one minute.
Aaaagh!
It' s comin 'in like hail!
Jesus Christ!
Ella!
I got it!
Jesus Christ!
Nate!
I got that loud...... son of a bitch!
I reckon that man has killed himself.
Goddamn you!
Christ!
We should have gone right into town.
We all wanna hold together.
To push ourselves ahead, to protect what we have.
There' s no use in either lyin 'down or givin' up.
He says that...
... he quit this morning...... the employment of Averill.
Averill is still his friend.
There is only one crime in this country, and that is to get caught!
No!
They are opposed...... to anything that would settle and improve things in this country.
Or try to make it something more than...
- Cow pasture.
Eastern speculators.
They... advanced the idea that poor people...... have nothing to say in the affairs of this country.
They' re here!
They' re here.
They' re already here!
We' re going to shoot all the sons of bitches!
And even the army won' t save them!
He' s dead!
Say something, goddammit.
I told you so?
Well, I told you so.
He loved you.
He thought you were his friend.
I' m not responsible.
He knew what was comin 'and he made his own decision.
And so did you.
- They just voted against you, Charlie!
- Your fears are unfounded!
Somebody, please!
We need a physician!
Ella!
You' re goin 'the wrong way!
This way!
Ella...
Go home!
Mount up!
Boy!
They' re comin '!
They' re comin '!
What the hell' s goin 'on?
Stay together!
Keep on!
Get that wagon over here!
We need a position over here!
Dismount!
Dismount!
Get your horses in here!
Dismount!
Come on!
- You son of a bitch!
- Get that wagon over here!
- We need a position over here!
- Get the hell outta here!
Get in position!
Fire!
Stay down, goddammit!
Get the hell outta here!
Get down!
Stay down, Billy!
I sometimes wonder why in the hell you' re here at all.
There' s too many of them, Wolcott.
It' s not like the Indians.
You can' t just kill them all.
Finally hit us some pay dirt here.
Get down!
This time last year I was in Paris.
I love Paris.
Get off the wagons!
Oh, God, do I love Paris!
Get down!
Get down!
All flesh is grass.
Sad...
Sad thing.
Come with me.
Wolcott!
I' m going for help.
I' il be back!
Take cover!
Pull back across the river!
Take cover!
I...... just want to live.
"It don' t look as if there' s much chance of my getting away."
"I hope they did not hurt Ella."
"The house is all fired."
"Goodbye, Ella and Jim, if I never see you again."
"Nathan D Champion."
Are you all right, Ella?
Wait for me at your place.
Is really good work.
Where did you get the idea for this?
Romans used 'em somethin' like 2, 000 years ago...... on terrain just about like this.
Go!
Those goddamn Romans.
Go!
Averill, you son of a bitch, we' re gonna hang ya.
Go!
Keep goin '!
Deborah, stay down!
Everyone together!
I think my legs are broken!
These men are under arrest by military authority!
You can all go home now!
Frank... you know these men are under the jurisdiction of civil authorities.
I have here a telegram from the governor...... stating in the most positive terms...... that only immediate and drastic action...... on the part of authorities outside and above county officials...... can reduce the current state of almost anarchy in Johnson County.
Almost anarchy?
Let me take them outta here peacefully, or you' il be shot for insurrection.
Rescuin 'was what you' re doin'.
I told you, Jim, it' s not me that' s doin 'it to you.
Follow about!
Damn you!
Ella!
Ella.
Oh, Ella, don' t die.
Oh, Ella.
God!
I' d like a cigarette.
By the spring of 1 979, Nicaraguans from all walks of life joined together in a final attempt to overthrow President Anastasio "Tacho" Somoza.
As the fighting got worse in Central America, journalists throughout the world began to realize this could become a

- Allez- y voir le camion.
Hey, Pricey.
You tuna- sucking piece of raw meat, get your ass over here.
Move over.
Sit down here.
- How you doin '?
- Good.
Good to see you.
What the hell you going to Zambeze for?
I thought I' d get some great shots of your head being blown to smithereens.
Smithereens!
- Thought you were with the government.
- I am.
- This is the government.
- These are the rebels.
The fuck they are.
This is a government convoy to Calunda.
This is the Abou Deian revolutionary front.
You' re shittin 'me.
They' d be pissed off if they knew.
This is the dumbest motherfucker I ever signed up for, man.
It don' t even pay shit.
Nicaragua.
That' s the spot.
Cheap shrimp, lotta rays.
It' s real thin in the spook department too.
You dig me?
Price, I don' t what you' re doin ', but you' d better get your ass down here.
Come on, man.
You' re gonna get ripped to shit.
(gunfire)
Oates, what the hell is this?
The US government offers that house to any Cuban pilot flying MiGs for the rebels who chooses to defect to America with a Russian jet.
- But that' s bullshit.
- We know that, but they don' t.
They figure the Cubies will go for that pool, so they don' t let them near the jets.
The rebels can' t fly MiGs.
Pricey, that' s the point.
They destroy their own air force.
It' s an old scam, but it' s guaran- fuckin '- teed.
ClA?
- Yeah.
The smartest guys in the world.
I guess we found out where the government is.
You can walk to work from here.
What a break.
I guess I' il get goin '.
Take care.
Be careful.
(Price) I love Africa.
(woman) So this strange war grinds into its seventh year.
From Ndjamena, Chad, this is Claire Sheridan.
No, no, you didn' t hear any music.
It must be the connection.
OK.
Yes.
Goodbye.
Alex, don' t play that goddamn thing when I' m filing.
We' re late.
It' s my party.
We' il be late.
You called it a strange war.
lf you filed that story with me, I would say you were editorialising.
Well, I like to editorialise.
- Are you drunk?
- Drunk?
Only with the memory of making love to you on the plains of Fianga, with the First Liberation Army marching by, and opening fire.
- We freed the proletariat?
- And we freed...
I' m going to the party without you.
I don' t wanna go to this party.
I' m bad at false modesty.
- You' re great at it.
- You' re right, I am.
Alex, you' re gonna make a great anchorman in New York.
Undoubtedly I could win an Emmy as a hostess, but I' m not going with you.
You could operate out of New York.
We could buy a place, burn our suitcases.
I still like suitcases.
I' m tired of memorising the President of the Republic of Maldives.
- You tired of Third- World wars?
- No, I' m tired of Third- World elevators.
Look...
Wait.
Don' t leave me.
I have to, Alex.
Fuck Abou Deia and New York.
I' m goin 'to Nicaragua with you.
- No!
- It' s a neat little war and a nice hotel.
Hey!
Alex!
Alex!
Come on!
Yeah!
All right, I want you to know this is the man that hired me for my first job.
And fired you from your first job.
- And then hired me for my second job.
- And fired you!
Some of you may be asking yourself "What am I doing in this strange war?"
Another chapter in an endless struggle that' s grinding into its seventh year.
But who of us can forget the giant struggle on the plains of Fianga?
The give and take, the lunging, the parrying for position, the jockeying around, knowing full well...
Thank you very much.
Look at this.

Oh, excuse me.
I didn' t know you were in here.
Yes, you did.
You were taking pictures of me all over the room.
Well, you know...
I mean...
- Jeez, you look great.
- Thanks.
Here.
This is for Alex.
That' s lovely, but it' s not the best thing you could give him right now.
- Why not?
- We just split up.
- Who split up from who this time?
- This time?
This time I' m the villain.
I thought it would be cleaner with me in Central America and him in New York.
Did he shout about burning your suitcases?
Yeah.
Well...
I don' t own any suitcases.
There' s nothing to burn.
This is a great shot.
Yes, it is.

- Hey, Russel.
How are you?
- Hey!
- Ah...
Welcome to Managua.
- Did you have anything to do with that?
Well, I thought of calling your photographs "The Pictures of a Lost War".
The New York editors loved it, since they didn' t know where Chad was.
It kinda legitimised their ignorance.
You got your cover, I got a feature.
A class struggle in three little words.
Nifty, huh?
Nifty, I say.
- I' m Russel Price.
- This is lsela Cruz.
She works at the hotel, also as a translator.
My pleasure.
You guys have a few problems down here, between the "poets"... and the government?
Problems?
Down here it' s called a war.
It started in 1 930, before you were born...
Excuse me.
My Spanish is not good.
What did he say?
He said he considers it an honour to be able to photograph our war.
- He' s got a real way with words.
- I can tell.
- You' re a hell of a translator.
- I know.
I' m much in demand around here.
Will you excuse me?
- lf you have any questions, just ask.
- Who' s Rafael?
Depends on who you ask.
Rafael.
Comandante Rafael.
He is either a Marxist dupe of Russia and Cuba or the most popular leader of a democratic revolution.
Take your pick.
Hell of a face.
Would he like to be photographed?
- You would never find him.
- Wanna bet?
You would lose.
He' s never been photographed.
- Congratulations on your elephants.
- Oh, thank you.
So far, Alex, this war has the hell beat out of Africa.
- You' re gonna have a ball.
- (man) Alex!
I need a translator much more than you do right now.
Aren' t you hangin 'in there with Claire?
I' m hangin 'in there, like an interim post- war government waiting for the palace to be overrun by younger men.
Younger men?
You know, I still only have one major weakness.
- Oh, only one?
I hold onto things too long.
I' m too loyal.
OK, Alex, listen.
Jody borrowed 100 rials from me in Tehran.
I owe 40 bucks to Dick, and he' il pay me in lire for a future in pesos.
But you gotta pay Eddie in dollars, so I can square it with Chuck.
We got it all worked out - cash.
- You take Nicaraguan?
- No cordobas.
But I' il go double or nothing with you on the whole pile.
OK.

I like it.
* Spring is here, no mistakin '
Well, I just got off the boat.
Give me the scoop on Nicaragua.
Well, about 60 years ago, the US marines invaded to protect American business interests.
Put down a small peasant revolt led by a very small man named Augusto Sandino.
I don' t mean the peasant stuff.
I mean the real stuff.
Come on.
Well, there are two kinds of beer:
Tona and Victoria.
Victoria' s better.
And two... watch out for Miss Panama.
Hot, hot, hot, but don' t touch.
She belongs to Tacho.
El presidente has said that if he catches anybody with her, he will cut off his...

- Right.
And throw it in Lake Managua.

Hello, Claire.
Haven' t seen you since, uh...
- Three Mile lsland?
Holiday lnn, right?
(Claire) Well, look who walked in.
Before you fall in love, that' s Marcel Jazy, friend of wine, women, and Somoza.
Yeah, I know.
He' s also a businessman in search of a business, who doesn' t try to cover up his connection to Washington.
I like his connection in Nicaragua tonight.
But look at those moves.

We don' t want to waste ammunition on someone like you.
- What do you want?
- Shut up!
Come with us.
We won' t hurt you.
We' il trade you for some Nicaraguans who care about their country.
Come on.
Let' s go.
Hold on.
Alex, it' s Charlie from New York.
He says a nightclub bombing isn' t big enough to hold for the world section.
There were bits of body in the piano and the song was "Moonlight in Vermont".
- What' s he got better than that?
- He' s got the Pope in Egypt.
Terrific.
Forget the Pope.
You got the Pope someplace every week.
There' s a big story down here, because it' s the first sign of fighting in Managua.
Look up Nicaragua.
You drive to New Orleans and then you turn left.
Oh, like hell I' m editorialising.
Look, it happened in a room full of press and ClA.
How do I know they were ClA?
Because they wore name tags.
What do you think?
We' re backing a fascist government.
I know that' s not news, but see if you can find an angle, huh?
Alex, there' s fascist and there' s fascist.
Let' s not use words like that, OK?
No, we don' t have any pictures of Rafael, because nobody knows where he is.
Anybody crazy enough to go and look for him is gonna get his nuts shot off.
Same to you, Charlie.
- What do you want?
- We' ve met, Alex.
Hub Kittle, from Lewitsky and Knupp, New York, public relations.
- Who' s your client?
President Somoza.
Yeah, I know, I know, but there' s an untold story here.
The man has a point of view too, right?
Right.
You' re, uh...
Price, right?
Russel?
I need to know whether Russian or Cuban- made guns were brought in.
lf the guerillas had help, the war would have ended long ago.
- Well, that' s fine, but we need proof.
- Claire!
It' s your daughter from Los Angeles.
Hello.
Hello, darling.
How are you?
Has your grandmother spoiled you silly by now?
She has?
Great.
Yes, I got the letter with the picture of your dress.
You don' t think it' s cut a little too low?
You don' t, huh?
Well, I do.
Gringo.
You' re under arrest.
I' m a journalist.
Periodista.
Here, I got my passport.
You take too many pictures.
Periodista.
Wake up, Priest, son of a whore.
Cigarrillo?
Sí.
You' re a priest, huh?
A padre?
What are you doing here?
The government accused me of knowing Rafael.
Governments are always wrong, huh?
- Who are you?
- Periodista.
I' d like to find Rafael myself.
- Whose side are you on?
- I don' t take sides, I take pictures.
No side?
Go home.
- Espérate aquí.
- Sí.
Mr Price.
It was all a misunderstanding.
Your camera.
I' m sorry.
Passport.
Before you go, you will sign some papers.
- What papers?
- Your visitation papers, Mr Price.
You were not arrested.
You just came to visit, in case your embassy asks.
You want your passport back, yes?
- You OK?
- I' m fine.
- How' d you know where to find me?
- Where else?
What happened?
Oh, I was just visiting.
I think he had me released.
- Jazy?
Think there' s a story?
- I don' t know.
But I can start looking.
- Looking for what?
- I' m gonna find Rafael.
Now, Russel, we have to be clever with Jazy.
I won' t come right out and ask him if he' s a spy or not.
(Claire laughs)
- Are you a spy or aren' t you?
- Spy is such a nonword, Mr Price.
- Nobody is a spy any more.
- Russel prefers pictures to words.
You don' t have to apologise.
You are journalists.
- And you' re a businessman?
- A businessman...
That sounds good.
OK, I' m a businessman.
Why was I arrested and then released?
Who the hell are you?
- No water?
- No, no water.
Marcel, you told me there' d be water in the pool this week.
lf she dove in, I assure you she would not notice.
My darling, the guerillas destroyed the pumping station in Masaya.
We must ration water for now.
Maybe I should go back to Panama?
Maybe you should.
Please.
Con permiso.
You were arrested because the Guardia are clowns who specialise in excess.
You were released because I told them to release you.
Thank you.
Those aren' t the normal duties of a businessman.
But they are the normal duties of a spy.
You win, I am a spy.
There, are you happy?
I feel better.
Now we can relax.
You can turn off your little thing.
Oh, I trust you won' t say anything to hurt me.
Why would we wanna do that?
ln some ways, I am a terrible spy.
I used to be much better at it, but now it seems everyone knows who I am.
I have too many girlfriends.
I like to be photographed.
I always talk too much.
But my girlfriends like that.
- No matter.
- (woman) Marcel?
- Do you know who she is?
- No.
That' s Miss Panama.
Do you know who that is?
Yes, I do.
She' s in love with me.
I' ve got to get some water in the pool.
And once a week I have lunch with President Somoza to discuss security measures against the Sandinista insurgents, and all he wants to talk about is Miss Panama.
He is worried about her.
- He thinks she' s seeing another man?
- He assigned me to find out who he is.
Thank you.
We all know the revolutionaries are going to win.
Don' t we?
You know, I saw this picture on a leaflet in Africa.
You know what they all say about it?
That you' re the genius that created that idea.
It was a lot of people' s idea.
Have you been to León?
- No.
- No, we' re going to Masaya.
We understand the rebels have entered the cuartel.
You would love León.
A nice cathedral.
Beautiful light.
- We' re not doing a travelogue.
- Of course, of course.
Only I have heard that Comandante Rafael was recently in the area.
- Rafael' s near León?
- Well, it' s a rumour.
What do I know?
Marcel, estoy desamparada.
- She' s lonely.
- Well, we don' t want to keep you.
It' s my job.
Do you think I talk too much?
(Russel) So Rafael' s near León.
Did you dream about Miss Panama last night?
I dreamed about you.
- Did you have a good time?
So did you.
ls that an old war injury flaring up?
- ls that tape recorder on?
- Absolutely.
I was sunning myself on the USS Pueblo when the North Koreans attacked.
I took a bullet in the chest.
But I was lucky.
I had a roll of Ektachrome in my pocket here over my heart...
And the bullet ricocheted over the film and grazed your cheek...
Saved my life.
You heard about it, huh?
- Do you ever dream about me?
- Yeah, once.
How was it?
Fast.
- How fast?
- Real fast.
You mean this fast?

It' s not my blood.
- Man, that kid' s got a good arm.
- Yeah.
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- What the fuck are you doing here?
Man, my ears are freakin 'out.
You' re lookin 'good.
- How do you like Nicaragua?
- It' s beautiful.
Yeah, there' s a shitload of greasers, though.
(man) No queda nadie.
- Pricey, I' il see you later, man.
- Yeah.
Se acabó, vámonos!
- You OK?
- Yeah, I' m fine.
The kid' s got a hell of an arm.
Sandy Koufax, no?
- Gracias, padre.
- De nada.
Vayan con Dios.
Koufax was good.
But Dennis Martinez, he is the best.
He' s from Nicaragua.
He pitches major leagues.
- I' d like to find Rafael.
- He was here, but he' s gone.
He' s going to Matagalpa, no?
You control a baseball better than your words.
Rafael cannot be found.
You understand, compañeros?
What' s Rafael doing in Matagalpa?
Just keep your talk to baseball.
You see Dennis Martinez, you tell him that my curve ball is better, that I have a good scroogie.
I like Sandinistas.
And I like Baltimore Orioles.
(Russel) You bastard!
- What are we gonna do about him?
- He' s dead.
(Claire) You can' t believe everything you hear in the news.
I' il try and get back before you graduate.
I love you very, very much.
I' il finish this up back at the hotel, honey.
Bye- bye now.
I know who shot Pedro.
Somebody in the bell tower.
- Why didn' t you tell the guerillas?
- Because I knew they' d kill him.
And I didn' t wanna interfere.
It wasn' t an easy choice.
I think I made the wrong one.
Do you know that you didn' t shoot any pictures after that whole thing was over?
I didn' t, did l?
Oh, Jesus, I picked up the gun.
ls something happening to us?
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I know.
- How was Matagalpa?
- No bang- bang, Alex.
None at all.
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah.
Half the press corps.
Hello?
Claire.
Hey!
- Alex.
- How you doing?
- How was León?
- Bloody.
Claire, I' m tired of Nicaragua.
- You haven' t been here very long.
- Yeah.
Long enough.
Long enough.
You' re right.
Everybody' s right.
About what?
My cheekbones.
What do you think of 'em?
I like your cheekbones, Alex.
ls there anything the matter?
It' s a face made for television.
You mean you decided to go with the network?
Yeah.
They' re gonna give me ten grand a week to read the news.
I' m gonna be in 60 million homes every night.
When I take a breath, all of America will do so.
When my voice trembles, all of America will tremble.
I' m gonna be a star.
My voice will be more important than who controls Congress.
- You' il become a household name.
- I' il become a household name.
I should never have come down here.
I' m sorry, Alex.
I think it' s a lot better this way.
It' s all right.
Don' t worry about me.
I' m speaking in song titles.
- But promise me one thing.
- I' il promise you anything.
I don' t wanna make a speech to anyone.
- Russel?
- Russel who?
Him too.
(* "Cuando calienta el sol")
- Ça va bien?
- Comment ça va?
You' re running late, Mr President.
We can schedule this for another time.
Nonsense.
Let them wait.
We are a stunning couple, huh?
My stomach is like a rock.
I' ve been working out.
Yes, we are a stunning couple.
Mr President, you own one fifth of the land in Nicaragua.
You own the port, the airlines, the Mercedes dealership...
ls it a crime to be a car dealer?
Let me show you something.
It' s said that the Guardia operates a torture chamber at Coyotepe.
This is a portrait of my father.
He was very special to me.
Every Sunday morning I drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on his grave.
I think people should know that.
Would you comment on the fall of León to the rebels?
Listen, Russel.
Let' s grow up, huh?
It' s easy to fall in love with the underdog, but there' s an upside and a downside to this thing.
I just wanna remind you all this stuff about a "revolution of poets" is crap.
It' s great PR though, isn' t it, Hub?
So what' s the upside?
Simple, and it could happen.
Somoza destroys the insurgents, rebuilds the country, shitcans the purveyors of excess, stabilises the cordoba, and is finally beloved as the saviour of Nicaragua.
Our pal.
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah.
- What' s the downside?
- Commies take over the world.
Señor Kittle.
Excuse me, Russel, but the war may be over.
This is a democracy, and I have been freely elected by my people.
- There were more votes than voters...
- Presidente!
No me ven que estoy ocupado con esta señorita?
Váyase de aquí.
I have to conclude this encounter.
Something happened.
I have many more questions, Mr President...
Did he tell you about his parents and the graveyard?
- Yes, I know about that, but I' d like to...
- Good, good.
(applause)
- I' il just make sure everything' s set up.
- Sí, rápido.
My friends, this gathering was not supposed to be a press conference as much as a get- together.
But I' ve just been handed a piece of news.
Rafael is dead.
He has been killed in an ambush near Matagalpa.
- Mr President!
- How many people killed?
Sorry, my friends.
No questions, please.
A press release is being prepared.
Call Washington.
What do you think?
Tacho makes that speech about every six months.
Maybe he got lucky.
- Hub, is this for real?
- Yeah, sure.
Russel, excuse me, but Miss Panama would like her picture taken with Tacho.
- ln colour?
- OK.
A little embarrassing, huh?
Señor presidente.
Listo, listo.
That' il be fine right there.
How in the hell could Tacho find Rafael?
I have my hands full.
That' s fine right there.
ls Tacho lying again?
They did kill him, didn' t they?
What do I know?
Tacho needs a victory very badly.
He needs to prove to Jimmy Carter that he is still winning.
The death of Rafael is the proof he needs.
He just sent 25 million in new arms to Tacho.
No, no.
He didn' t.
The State Department is getting nervous about what is going on down here.
En el sol, por favor.
Pardon my French, but whose fucking side are you on?
- I work for everybody.
- That' s a great job.
I send messages to Jimmy and I tell him that the revolution is a flood which cannot be stopped, but it can be controlled.
Nobody listens to me.
I can' t even get a little water in my pool.
(Miss Panama giggles)
Would you switch sides, please?
For just one more.
That' s very nice, very nice.
Thank you.
I think Rafael is alive.
I' m gonna find him.
Thank you very much.
MATAGALPA NORTHERN PROVlNCE (gunfire)
- There' s the guy we' re lookin 'for.
- Terrific.
Go one more block.
I' m not gonna die in Matagalpa.
Slow down, my Queen.
Why so?
Are you not happy that unwonted joy now fills my breast?
Can you not see?
M y prison cell is the open sk y.
Oh!
How dear is the delight that now surrounds me!
Know you not that sorrow, sorrow awaits you within those walls?
On the meadows fragrant and fair appears the family of flowers and smiles, yes, smiles for me, and the breeze, returning from
France' s sweet shores, tells me to rejoice as in the happy days of my first youth.
Oh cloud!
Lightly drifting in the sk y, you bear my affection, you carry my sighs to the blessed land that once nurtured me.
Take me to that land, lift me away from my torments!
Yet the cruel cloud flees too towards the blessed land that once nurtured me.
What sounds!
- To the woods, to the hunt!
The stag appears...
- What voices!
I think it is the royal hunt!
The sounds come nearer...
The steeds...
- The Queen!
- Ah!
- The Queen!
- That dreaded name!
The tyrant is wandering through the park.
In the peace of my melancholy rest she will strike me with a new shock.
I cannot find this courage in my breast!
Let her stay, stay upon the beloved throne, and her gaze be far from me, too sorely am I despised; pity for me lies mute in everyone' s heart.
She is coming.
Let us run, run.
Run; my heart cannot bear this.
Her heart cannot bear this, no!
I n the peace of my melancholy rest she will strike me with a new shock.
I cannot find this courage in my breast!
Let her stay, stay upon the beloved throne, and her gaze be far from me, too sorely am I despised; pity for me lies mute in everyone' s heart.
D oes joy deceive me?
Leicester, is it you?
You?
He who adores you has come to break your chains.
Shall I finally be free of my prison?
Free?
And yours for ever?
M y troubled heart can scarce believe it.
Elizabeth is coming here, to her royal presence the hunt offers an excuse.
You must appear submissive...
Submissive to her!
Today you must.
Oh heavens!
What must I hear?
Ah, spare me this dreadful sight!
Stay.
M ust I?
And you must hope.
Prey to cruel pain, oppressed, forsaken, what hope is in my heart?
I am condemned to weep, to sigh for ever; your love alone can quiet my woes.
No:
You must not mistrust; she is greater on her throne...... Her heart was moved by your letter...
- What are you saying?... in her eye I glimpsed...... a tear appearing.
Ah!
I f you listen to me, and trust in me...... you will see that all will change.
I am convinced, convinced of her heart!
Yet often it holds mercy and pity.
Not for her who casts a shadow over her throne!
No, do you think so?
Then I myself, if she be deaf to your prayers shall take my own revenge.
What are you saying?
What can you do?
E xpose yourself to risk for me!
Ah, I would not have this.
I shall take my own revenge.
Ah!
I f ever my heart trembled at the cruel sight of death, do not make me tremble for your life.
All that I wish, all I seek is to see you, true and grateful; for you do I wish that my condition were not so wretched.
Yes, faith, honour binds it; and my heart which loves you swears it.
You will rise up from the misfortune that robs you of all your glory.
And if then I cannot offer you a throne, or the hand of a sovereign then I shall offer you the hand that released you from prison.
D o not open yourself to risk.
I swear that you will rise up from misfortune.
- Ah!
No!
- Yes, faith.
- Ah!
I do not wish - Yes, faith, honour binds it...
Ah!
D o not make me tremble for your life.
You will rise up from the misfortune
What place is this?
Fotheringhay.
Oh, Earl!
Where do you see me?
Have no doubt; presently M ary will be led into your presence by wise Talbot.
To what sacrifice do I stoop for you!
D o you see?
Remove the hunters from the adjacent avenues; the people' s path is too busy.
You see, my Queen, how Anglia adores you.
Ah!
You know it demands you to be its head.
Silence.
I led you.
The hand that brought her squalor can give her again the happiness of yesterday.
I abhor her!
He recalls only her.
C ome.
Leave me.
Take me back to my shelter.
Here she is.
Oh God.
She is still the same, haughty, proud; with her magnificent spirit she fills me with fury; but hush now; she is oppressed by just terror.
On the face of that tyrant I see the mark of her fierce sentence, and dread malice.
M y spirit is oppressed by cruel fear.
Receive her.
I would fain flee her.
D o not hold back.
The abyss stands before me.
Too proud is she.
B eaten down by cruel fate she stands wretched before you.
I am prostrate at your feet
I beg only your forgiveness, be not unrelenting
Sister, be satisfied now with the outrages you have inflicted on me!
Raise a miserable maiden who counts on your heart.
Pay no heed, I implore you, to her false lips.
No, that station suits you in dust and shame.
Suffering.
Who has made you so cruel to me?
Who?
You yourself; your soul, that haughty soul, vile, iniquitous...
And shall I suffer this?
Shall I?
Go, ask this, oh wretch,
of the betrayed bed of the unavenged ghost of that wretched husband; ask it of your arm, your wicked heart which midst the dalliance of love did plot crimes and betrayal and nought but treachery.
Ah!
Robert!
I can take no more.
Have a little faith, I beg you...
Call upon your constancy!... to her false lips.
S ome hope is left yet.
You shall not pay with honour and your life for a pardon granted to you, a favour which our love was oft denied by heaven.
What words in my presence!
You, Robert?
What shall I say?
Where is the charm of love, and that face so fair?
I f all long to praise it for favours as a reward; but on the Stuart' s head eternal shame has fallen again.
- Ah!
Robert!
Hold back!
I can take no more.
What an insult!
Oh wrongful mockery!
What insult!
Tremble, tremble!
I mpure daughter of B oleyn,
can you speak of dishonour?
Obscene, unworthy whore, my shame falls upon you, the soil of England is defiled, vile bastard, by your foot!
Ho, guards!
What words are these?
She rants!
There is no more hope for her!
Go, wild creature, prepare yourself, to suffer your final destiny:
On your despised head I shall cast infamy.
Drag away the wild creature who has condemned herself!
Ah, reckless one, I lose you, when I sought to save you.
When I came back to you in true faith destiny struck us down.
Yes, be silent, tremble, tremble, all hope now is lost.
Drag her away!
Lead me now to death; I shall challenge my final lot.
One single moment of triumph has repaid all my torment.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
- Slim?
- Yeah.
I can' t keep up with that guy.
It' il kill me.
All right.
- Jack!
- Yeah.
Take Mike' s place.
- Aw, Slim.
- Just for a while.
Mike, you take Jack' s place.
You' re on there.
So how long you and Lennie been together, George?
A long time.
A real long time.
Seems kinda funny, you two travelling around together.
What' s funny about it?
Well, a cuckoo like him and a smart guy like you.
Well, I ain' t so smart or I wouldn' t be bucking barley for my 50 bucks a month.
I guess you' re right.
How' d you two meet up?
Well, I knew his Aunt Clara.
She raised him up.
When she died, Lennie just come along with me working.
Uh- huh.
I used to play jokes on him cos he' s too damn dumb to take care of himself.
He' d do any damn thing I told him.
Put that on back in here.
I turns to him and I says "Jump in, Lennie."
And he jumps.
Couldn' t swim a stroke.
He damn near drowned before we could get to him.
He was so damn nice to me for pulling him out, he forgot I told him to jump in.
He' s a nice fella.
A guy don' t need no sense to be a nice fella.
Yeah.
He gets in trouble all the time cos he' s so goddamn dumb.
Like what happened up north in Weed.
What' d he do in Weed?
He seen this girl, in a red dress, and the dumb bastard that he is, he just...
He wants to touch everything he likes, so he reaches out to touch this red dress.
So the girl starts screaming, and that gets Lennie all mixed up, so he holds on and he won' t let go, cos that' s the only thing he can think to do.
So what happened?
Well, she runs off across the field, screaming.
So me and Lennie take off running.
Pretty soon we hear a bunch of guys with dogs coming after us.
Had to hide in the irrigation ditch until it was safe to get away.
He didn' t hurt the girl none?
Hell, no.
He just scared her.
Well... he ain' t mean.
I can tell a mean guy a mile off.
(boss) Milton!
I ain' t payin 'you to stand around.
- Get back to work.
- He just come over for a drink of water.
They' re way behind.
Let' s go.
Goddamnit, stop that racket!
Lennie.
I told you not to bring that pup in here.
I ain' t got no pup.
- Any of you boys seen my wife?
- She ain' t been here.
- Where the hell' s Slim?
- Went out to the barn.
Carlson, do you think he' s gonna find Slim in the barn with his wife?
Better not tangle with Slim.
Curley' s lookin 'for a fight.
I gotta see this.
Come on.
Thanks.
- Was Curley' s wife in the barn?
- If she was, I didn' t see her.
George.
Both the ends is the same.
- Why both the ends is the same?
- It' s just the way they make 'em.
You sure she didn' t come in the barn, like she come in here?
No, she never.
Give me a good whorehouse every time.
A guy can go in, get drunk, get it all out of his system all at once, and no messes.
- George.
- Yeah?
How long is it gonna be till we get the little place and live off the fat of the land?
Gotta get some money together first.
I know a little place where you can get cheap, but they ain' t giving it away.
Tell about that place.
It' s ten acres.
Got a little shack on it, and a chicken run.
Got rabbits, George?
I could easily build a few hutches and you could feed 'em alfalfa.
You' re damn right.
You' re goddamn right I could.
But, George, tell about the house.
Well, we have a little house, and we have a room to ourself.
And we have a little, fat, iron stove, and in the winter we keep a fire going in it.
And rabbits, George.
But I tend 'em.
How do I tend them rabbits?
You have a sack.
You fill up that sack and you bring it in and you put it in the rabbit cage.
like they done when I was a kid.
And it' d be our home.
Nobody could can us.
We don' t like a guy, we just say "Get the hell out."
If a friend come, we' d have an extra bunk.
We' d say "Why don' t you spend the night?" and, by God, he would.
We' d have a dog and a couple of cats, but you got to make sure them cats don' t get them rabbits.
(mumbles)
But... you just let them try.
I' m gonna break them goddamn cats' necks.
I smash them cats with a stick.
You know a place like this?
Suppose I do.
What' s it to you?
How much they want for a place like that?
- 600.
Old people that owns it is broke.
I ain' t much good with only one hand.
That' s why they give me a job sweeping.
And they give me $250 cos I lost my hand.
And I got 50 more saved in the bank right now.
That' s, uh... 300.
And I got 50 more coming at the end of the month.
Suppose I went in with you fellas.
That' d be $350 that I' d put in.
Huh?
- OK.
We was gonna do it by ourselves.
We were gonna do it by ourselves.
Well, now, wait a minute.
I' il tell you what.
I' d make a will and leave my share to you guys in case I kick off.
I ain' t got no relatives or nothin '.
You fellas got any money?
Maybe we can do it now.
- We got ten bucks between us.
- We got ten bucks.
- Ten bucks.
- Yeah.
You seen what they done to my dog?
They said he wasn' t no good no more.
I wish somebody' d shoot me when I ain' t no good, but they won' t do that.
They' lI can me, and I ain' t gonna have no place to go.
Look, if me and Lennie work a month and we don' t spend nothin ', we' lI have 1 00 bucks.
And you got 350?
Yeah, and you can have every cent of it.
That' d be 450.
Jesus Christ, I bet we could get it for that.
I' d work and make up the rest.
I' m gonna take that goddamn pup.
Sure, sure, sure.
You know what I' m gonna do?
I' il write those two old people that we' il take it.
Candy will send $1 00 to hold it?
I sure will.
I' lI have 30 more dollars the time you guys is ready to quit.
Tell him, George.
Tell him he can' t do it.
I' il get to hoe in the garden, even if I ain' t no good at it?
- Yeah, yeah.
They got a real nice stove!
But I bet that pup will like it there.
We' re gonna do it, goddamnit.
We can fix up that little old place and live there.
When we gonna do it?
One month.
Right smack in one month.
(men talking outside)
Now, don' t tell nobody about it.
- Just us three and nobody else.
- Don' t tell nobody.
George, I ought to have shot that dog myself.
I should not let no stranger shoot my dog.
I' m tired of...
- I just asked you!
You' ve been asking me too often and I' m damn sick of it.
If you can' t look after your goddamn wife, what do you expect me to do about it, huh?
- Lay off me.
- Didn' t mean nothing by it.
- I said lay off.
- Just thought you might have seen her.
- You keep out of this.
You goddamn punk.
You' re yellow as a frog belly.
You may be the best welterweight in the country,
- but I' il kick your goddamn head in.
- (man imitates a chicken clucking)
What the hell you laughing about?
Huh?
You!
Come on, you big bastard, get up.
No big son of a bitch is gonna laugh at me.
Get up.
- I' il show you who' s yellow.
- You got no cause for...
Get up!
- (man) Come on, Curley!
- Get up and fight.
- He didn' t do nothing.
Leave him alone.
- (Lennie) I didn' t.
(man) Cut it out, Curley.
- (man) Fight back.
- Make him stop.
- Get him, Lennie.
- (Lennie cries)
Get him!
Get him off of me!
Lennie.
Slim, help me.
- Lennie.
- Oh, God!
Lennie!
Lennie!
Lennie!
Lennie!
Let go of his hand.
Let go.
Jesus.
You told me to.
I know, I know.
Take it easy now.
Calm down.
We gotta get him to a doctor.
Carlson, get the wagon hitched up.
We' il take him into Soledad to get him fixed up.
I didn' t wanna hurt him.
I know.
It ain' t your fault, Lennie.
This punk had it coming to him.
(Curley groans)
Slim, is Curley' s old man gonna can us now?
Hey, you hear me?
Huh?
Hey!
- Huh?
I think you got your hand caught in a machine.
Now, if you don' t tell nobody what happened, we ain' t going to.
But you just tell, and try to get this guy canned, we' re gonna tell everybody what really happened.
Huh?
- Uh- huh.
George, you and Whitt, give me a hand.
Lift him up.
That' s it.
Candy, get the door.
Whitt, you go on into town with Carlson.
George.
Jesus, you look like hell.
Do... do I still get to tend the rabbits?
Sure, you ain' t done nothing wrong.
I didn' t want no trouble.
I know you didn' t.
Come on.
You be quiet so I can clean you up.
OK?
OK?
Hi, boys.
It' s hot out here.
Not cool like in the barn.
I said it' s hot out here!
Why don' t you go back to your house now?
We don' t want no trouble.
I ain' t giving you no trouble.
Think I don' t like to talk to somebody every once in a while?
You got a husband.
Go talk to him.
Sure, I got a husband.
Swell guy, ain' t he?
Say, what happened to Curley' s hand?
He got his hand caught in a machine.
Baloney!
What you think you' re selling me?
How' d you get them bruises on your face?
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.
Got his hand caught in a machine.
Yeah, OK.
(George) Lennie.
I' m gonna go into town with the guys.
- Yeah, yeah.
Just stay here for a while and then go back to the bunkhouse.
OK.
(man) Come on, George.
Don' t you get in no trouble.
You ain' t got no right to come into my room.
Ain' t nobody got a right to be in here but me.
I seen your light.
- Yeah, well, I got a right to have a light.
Now, I ain' t wanted in those bunkhouses and you ain' t wanted in my room.
- Why ain' t you wanted?
- Because I' m black.
They say I stink.
Well, I' il tell you, all of y' all stink to me.
Everybody went into town.
- Well, what you want?
I...
I seen your light.
Well, come on in and sit awhile if you won' t get out of here and leave me alone.
Goddamn your soul.
All the boys go into town?
All but old Candy.
He just sat in the bunkhouse, figuring about the rabbits.
What rabbits you talkin 'about?
The rabbits we' re gonna get, and I get to tend 'em.
You' re nuts.
You' re crazy as a wedge.
I don' t blame that guy you travel with for keeping you out of sight.
No, every word is the truth.
You can ask George.
You travel around with George, don' t you?
Me and George go everywhere together.
And sometimes he talk to you and you don' t understand what the hell he' s talking about.
How long do you think it' s gonna be before them puppies are old enough to take away from its mother?
Boy, I tell you.
Uh- uh!
Just talking and you don' t understand nothing.
It don' t make no difference if you don' t hear or understand, you just...
(babbles).. talking.
Just talking.
Just being with another guy.
That' s all.
Suppose...
George don' t come back no more.
What you do then?
What?
I said suppose George go into town tonight and you never heard of him no more.
George would never do nothing like that.
Well, suppose he get hurt or killed and he can' t come back.
George can' t get killed cos George is careful.
Well, just suppose.
What you do then?
I don' t know.
Gee, why are you doing anyways?
George ain' t hurt.
- Shall I tell you what' d happen?
They' d take you to the booby hatch and lock you up with a collar, like a dog.
- Who' il hurt George?
- (laughs) Just supposin '.
He' s all right.
He' s gonna come back.
- Then what you supposing for?
- Oh, I...
Ain' t nobody talk no hurt to George.
Now, now, George ain' t hurt.
Ain' t nobody talk no hurt to George.
George' il be back.
All right, all right, all right.
Calm down.
Go on.
Maybe you can see now.
You got George.
Suppose you ain' t got nobody.
Suppose you can' t go into the bunkhouse and play rummy because you' s black.
Suppose you have to sit out here with the mules and read books.
Books ain' t no good.
A guy goes nuts, he ain' t got nobody.
I tell ya, a guy gets too lonely, he gets sick.
Maybe I better go see.
I didn' t mean to scare you.
George gonna come back all right.
I was just talking about myself, that' s all.
We' re gonna get a little place of land and rabbits and windmill.
You' re nuts.
(George) Lennie!
- That' s George.
- Yeah.
I' m in here, George.
You shouldn' t be in here.
Yeah, well, I told him, but he come on in anyway.
- Why didn' t you kick him out?
- Well, I...
I guess I didn' t care much.
Come on.
Night.
George, I thought you were gonna stay in town.
- Well, why' d you think that?
- That nigger told me.
He tell you got hurt.
(Curley' s wife) Hey!
Did you see Curley in town?
No.
He went into town.
His old man went into town, too.
(George) Yeah.
I couldn' t even play my records tonight.
I got no records left.
I had four.
"Am I Blue", "Little by Little", "Button Up Your Overcoat" and "Ten Cents a Dance".
Curley got mad at me after supper, broke all my records.
I know how you got them bruises on your face.
And how Curley got his hand busted.
He got his hand caught in a machine.
All right.
Someday I' m going into town, and no one' s ever gonna see me again.
Not Curley, not his old man, not a damn one of you bindle stiffs!
(sobs)
George, she' s crying.
George, why is she crying?
I don' t know.
- Oh, that' s good.
Good, that' s good.
Maybe we should send the binding money?
No, no.
Let' s wait till we hear back from 'em.
- Well, I hope they ain' t already sold it.
- Oh, don' t you worry about that.
I' d feel a lot better sending the money now.
Well, let me think about it.
We' il be there before you know it.
Come on, Crooks, put it in.
Oh, good shot.
That' s the way.
Still in there.
(crying)
Why did you get killed?
You ain' t seen so little as the mice.
(mumbles angrily)
George is never gonna let me tend my rabbits if he finds out you got killed.
Come on, George.
Put that ringer on.
One of 'em got very close.
- OK, Slim, come on.
- Shut up, Smiley.
- Ringer time.
What you got there, sonny boy?
George says I ain' t got nothing to do with you.
George giving you orders about everything?
I ain' t gonna talk to you or nothing.
The guys got a horseshoe tournament going on.
None of them guys is gonna leave.
Why can' t I talk to you?
I never get to talk to nobody.
I get awful lonely.
I ain' t supposed to talk to you.
You can talk to people, but I can' t talk to nobody but Curley, or else he gets mad.
How' d you like not to talk to anybody?
What you got covered up there?
I...
That' s the pup.
That' s the little pup.
Why, it' s dead.
But I was just playin 'with him.
Don' t you worry none.
You can get another one, easy.
Well, it ain' t that so much, but George ain' t gonna let me tend them rabbits now.
- Why don' t he?
- Well, he said when...
I did any bad things, then I wouldn' t be able to tend them rabbits.
Don' t you worry about talking to me.
Listen to the guys yell.
They ain' t gonna leave till it' s over.
I ain' t supposed to talk to you.
He told me this.
Well, what' s the matter with me?
Ain' t I got a right to talk to nobody?
George says you get the people in a mess.
Oh, nuts.
What kinda harm am I doing to you?
I tell ya, I ain' t used to living like this.
I could' ve made something outta myself.
Maybe I will yet.
A show come through Salinas, and I met one of the actors.
He says I could go with the show.
My old lady wouldn' t let me, but this guy says I coulda.
You bet.
Say, we were supposed to get a little place and then get rabbits.
Another time, I met a guy - he was in the pictures.
Went out to the Riverside Dance Palace with him.
He says he was gonna put me in the movies.
He says I was a natural.
As soon as he got back to Hollywood he was gonna write to me about it.
I never did get that letter.
I always thought my old lady stole it, too.
She said no.
I married Curley.
Met him out at the Riverside Dance Palace that same night.
- Are you listenin '?
- Sure.
I ain' t told this to nobody before.
And maybe I oughtn' t to.
I don' t like Curley.
He ain' t a nice fella.
I could' ve been in the movies.
Had nice clothes.
This guy said I was a natural.
Maybe if you took this pup and you throwed him away, then George would never know and I' d get to tend them rabbits with no trouble.
What makes you so nuts about rabbits?
I like to pet nice things with the fingers.
Soft things.
Everybody likes that.
Do you like to feel velvet?
You bet, by God.
I had me some too.
The lady give me some and then I lost it.
You' re nuts.
But you' re kinda a nice fella.
Just like a big baby.
Sometimes when I' m doing my hair, I just sit and stroke it cos it' s so soft.
Feel right here.
That' s nice.
Like it, don' t ya?
I like it too.
It feels nice.
That' s nice.
That' s nice.
Don' t mess it up.
You' il mess it up.
Don' t muss it up.
Let go.
You let go.
- Don' t.
Don' t.
- Let go.
- Let go!
Sssh!
- (screams) - Hey, no.
Hey, don' t do none of that.
Please, don' t you go yelling.
Don' t!
Don' t you go yelling.
Don' t!
Don' t!
(screams)
Don' t yell!
Don' t do that!
George is gonna be mad if you yell.
Don' t wanna hurt you, but you' re gonna get me in trouble.
You done a bad thing.
I done a bad thing.
I done a really bad thing.
(cheering)
Lennie!
Lennie!
Lennie, I got something here to show you.
I didn' t know you was out here.
You oughtn' t to sleep out here.
Jesus Christ.
Hey!
Damn.
What are we gonna do now, George?
- No, no.
We oughta let him get away.
You don' t know that Curley.
Curley' s gonna wanna get him lynched.
I ain' t gonna let him hurt Lennie.
All right, now, listen.
The guys might think I was in on it.
So I' m gonna go in the bunkhouse, and then you give me a minute, then you come out and tell the guys about her, and then I' il come along and make like I never seen her.
Will you do that?
Sure, George.
(cheering)
Slim!
Slim!
Something happened to Curley' s wife.
Come quick.
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on!
- What the hell' s going on, Candy?
Come on.
Move it.
(man whispers) She ain' t moving.
I know who done it.
That little son of a bitch done it.
I' m gonna get him.
I' m gonna get my rifle and I' m gonna kill that son of a bitch myself.
- I' il get my gun.
- I' il go with you.
Tom, let' s get the horses.
Her...
Her neck' s bust.
Lennie could' ve done that?
- Well, I guess we gotta get him.
- Couldn' t you bring him in... and... and lock him up?
He' s nuts.
He never done this to be mean.
If we could keep Curley in, we might.
But Curley' s gonna wanna shoot him.
And suppose they lock him up and strap him down and put him in a cage?
That ain' t no good, George.
Come on, men.
Let' s get a move on it.
It ain' t in my bunk.
Nigger' s got a shotgun.
Take his.
Curley, maybe you' d better stay here with your wife.
Oh, no, goddamnit.
I' m gonna kill the son of a bitch myself.
(Curley) Come on, let' s move!
(dogs barking)
(Slim) Whitt, Mike, Carlson, you fellas ride with me.
(Curley) Anybody finds him, hold him till I get there cos I want the first crack at him.
I' m gonna take my men north.
Let 'em go.
Come on, move out!
Move it.
Come on, let' s go.
George?
- Find Lennie before they get to him.
- Are you gonna help him get away?
I don' t know what I' m gonna do.
(dogs barking)
Lennie.
Lennie!
Lennie!
George.
I didn' t forget, George.
I didn' t remember where we was, but I didn' t forget.
I couldn' t find it.
- It' s OK.
- I couldn' t find it.
- It' s OK.
OK?
I didn' t forget what you told me.
It' s OK.
It' s OK.
George?
Yeah?
Ain' t ya gonna give me hell?
Like... like you done before?
Like "If I didn' t have you, I' d take my 50 bucks, go into a cathouse..."
Jesus Christ, Lennie.
You can' t remember nothing that happens, but you remember every word I say.
I thought you was mad at me, George.
No.
I ain' t mad.
I ain' t never been mad.
I know you ain' t.
Nope.
I done a bad thing.
It don' t make no difference.
George...
George, where are we gonna go now?
I don' t know.
I...
I like it here.
George, tell me like you done before.
About them other guys and about us.
(dogs barking in distance)
George, tell it like you done before.
OK.
OK.
OK?
I' il tell ya.
OK?
- Where?
- Over there.
- OK?
Over there.
- OK.
Guys like us, they got no family.
They ain' t got nobody who gives a hoot in hell about 'em.
That' s it, George.
But not us.
Tell about us now.
- Because...
- Cos I got you.
- And I got you, George.
That' s what gives a hoot in hell about us.
George, but tell now how it' s gonna be.
We' re gonna get a little place.
OK.
Yeah.
We' re gonna get a little place and we' re gonna...
- We' re gonna...
-.. have...
We' re gonna have a cow, and some pigs, and we' re gonna have maybe a chicken.
- Down in the flat, we' lI have a...
- Field of alfalfa for the rabbits.
- For the rabbits...
- And I get to tend the rabbits.

But it' s your party.
- It' s Mum' s party.
- No, it' s your birthday.
It' s your party and if you...
If you don' t feel like inviting anyone, then...
But I will.
It' s not odd when you' re new somewhere -
- that it' s difficult finding friends in the beginning.
In the beginning?
Dad, we' ve been here for two years.
No.
We moved here in June, that' s one and a half.
- I will give them out!
- But you don' t have to.

Elin, are you asleep?
I can just tell you that...
Escape, disappearance.
- Fuge - No, fugue.
- Bus.
- Puss?
Oh... bus...
- I just don' t want to.
- You got your period?
- You' re so bloody irritable.
- Not at all!
I just don' t want to go to Christian' s party.
It' s mild weather.
- I want to go to a rave.
- To a rave?!
- Or we could mug a pensioner.
- You' re a twisted sicko!
- You' re so boring!
- We could go to Agnes' party.
- Which Agnes?
- Agnes, aren' t you having a party?
- Ignore it.
- I hate her.
- Everything' s so boring.
- Just ignore it.
I hate my life!
Agnes.
I' m going to stop breathing.
Hey, Agnes, we' il come to the party!
What' re you doing in my room?
- Checking for my ice skates.
- Why' d they be here?
Jessica?
Fetch my skirt, I can' t wear these
I don' t know how to have it.
- I' m so beautiful!
- My stomach...
- I' m going to be Miss Sweden.
- You' re too small.
Why?
How old do you have to be?
- You' re too small, you' re too short.
- I' il do it anyway.
- Shit.
Where' s my skirt?
- What skirt?
My skirt, didn' t you bring my skirt?
Elin, are you completely...
Are you thinking of going out like that?
No, I was just going to use the mirror and...
Good God...
- That' s the way it is.
- We can' t go out 'cause I wasn' t wearing any pants?
You' re still too immature to understand you can' t go around like that?
- Imagine if it' d been someone else?
- Yes, imagine.
I' d be embarrassed myself.
Get a mirror so we don' t go out there.
We had a lovely mirror, but someone broke it.
- You' re nagging...
- Mum, it was just the lift.
- She wasn' t going to go out.
- Let this be a lesson.
It doesn' t hurt being at home.
I don' t like you going out to raves...
Mum, it isn' t a rave, it' s just a normal party.
- It' s ELin who goes on about raves.
But, we' ve never even been to a rave.
You know that raves are out?
I read it in a magazine.
They were in an "out" list.
Where does it say they' re out?
Here, somewhere.
Why must we live in fucking shit and piss Åmål?!
When something' s in it takes so long to get here -
- it' s out already because we' re so fucking behind!
- We can' t stay here, we have to move!
- I' m working tonight.
You can stay here together and have fun.
I bought crips and soft drinks.
- Well done, Elin.
Great to be home.
- Goodbye.
We' il leave later, she can' t check.
- How many did you invite?
- A few.
- But I' m not sure they' il...
- I' il put everything out.
- What' s that smell?
- It' s roast beef in the oven.
- Great!
I thought...
Your daughter' s vegetarian and you' re serving meat.
Fantastic!
But, sweetheart...
I thought we could take a few of these.
Can' t we take some of these?
Novalukol.
Novalukol Novum.
- You can' t swallow them.
- "30 lozenges for cases of heartburn".
- But if you take a lot...?
- No, it won' t work.
What about this?
"Longovital.
Drop it, Elin...
- What about Alvidon?
- Come on!
Nothing' il happen.
Yes...
But I want to take some drugs!
- But nothing' il happen.
- Yes it will.
- No, no it won' t.
- Yeah.
- I' il do something else.
Fall in love.
- I thought you were.
- With who?
The Italian?
- He wasn' t Italian.
He said he was.
I always wanted an Italian.
- Where' d he come from?
- Something like that.
Aren' t you in love with him anymore?
- No, that was yesterday.
- You should think of your reputation.
You' re just the same.
- You' ve had as many as me.
- No I haven' t.
- Have.
- No?
I don' t.
- Only one.
No one' s putting anything in me.
- Fingers maybe...
- And that' s Markus.
- Ah, Markus...
- I only sleep with one...
- I haven' t slept with anyone, anyway.
- No, but you' ve necked about 70, 000.
- So what?
- You know people are talking?
Really?
You know what zero times zero is?
That' s how much I care.
They won' t do it when I' m a film star.
They' il just proudly say they knew me -
- went to the same school.
"There' s their house" and stuff...
Johan, you owe me 100 crowns.
Where' s your wallet?
You' il get it.
- Give it here.
- I see...
- Must have been my brother.
Johan...
Elin?
- I just think she' s nice.
- 'Course she' s nice, but...
- Know how many she' s been with?
- No.
Everyone' s been with her.
- Not me.
- She' s not worth having.
- I think she' s worth having.
- Jesus, you' re 17 and she' s 14.
That' s three years.
There' s one year between us.
Three between you.
- Makes no odds if you like each other.
- Shall I talk to her?
I can call and fix it.
See if she' s going to the party.
Listen, Johan wants to know something about Elin.
Is Elin going to the party?
Johan Hult?
He wants to know if you' re going to Christian' s.
He' s in love with you.
- What she say?
- That Elin' s coming.
- Anything else?
- Like... like she was interested.
- She thinks you' re good looking.
- Jessica said that?
- That Elin thinks so?
You sure? - Yeah.
Did Jessica say that Elin thinks I' m good looking?
- What' d you say?
- I said you thought nothing of him.
- Not as far as I know, anyway.
- God this sucks!
"Want a ride?" He' il be after me all night.
- You wanted to fall in love.
- Not Johan Hult!
- I think Johan is sweet.
- He' s at high school and has a moped!
- Yes, but maybe he' d be good for you.
- Hardly.
- Can' t we go somewhere else?
- Where?
I don' t know.
I' d even rather go to Agnes.
- Agnes?!
- Yeah, from 9A.
She' s having a party.
Are you braindead, or what?
- What if a great guy is there?
- At Agnes'?
- Yes, maybe she knows someone really nice.
- Sure.
- People from somewhere else.
- From where?
Don' t be so negative!
Säffle, Bengtsfors, Mellerud...
Please...
- Okay, okay...
- Thanks!
- We' il wait a little while.
- I' ve waited.
- Have a little patience.
Mum, no one' s coming.
Here they are.
- Hi.
Welcome.
- Thanks.
I' il fetch Olof to help you up.
- Can we have food now?
- Just wait a while.
Perhaps Robyn' s silly, but I think it smells really good.
Let me see.
Wow...
Have you seen it, Oskar?
- Can we have food now?
- Maybe that' s a good idea.
- What do you say, dear?
- I can' t accept this.
- Sorry, but I can' t accept this.
- What can' t you accept?
If this is the best you can do, don' t bother.
- Agnes.
- Go home and take your perfume.
Not so?
You know the most boring thing I' ve done?
Going to wheelchair basketball in Karlstad with you.
I don' t want to be friends with a palsied cripple -
- who listens to BackStreet Boys, Arvingarna, or whatever shit you listen to.
Blame yourself!
I didn' t want a party, it was your idea.
Cut it out.
I don' t want to hear one more word.
You can stay here and enjoy the wonderful roast beef!
Have fun!
No one will ever like me!
Why should I live?
I don' t want to live, I want to die!
No, I want to die!
I' m sorry...
This whole party business...
That all my friends would come?
I have no friends, haven' t you understood, not one!
Mum hasn' t understood anything, anyway.
Hey, there there...
'Cause she can' t understand these things...
- Sweetheart.
- I know exactly how she was.
She was... she was like one of those...
Now she thinks it awful her daughter' s become so strange -
But darling.
You' re not a failure, repulsive or strange at all...
- You' re wonderful.
- No, I' m not.
- Agnes, you' re a wonderful person.
- No, I' m not.
Yes, you' re wonderful...
Wonderful, Agnes.
- I can' t see why I agreed.
- Don' t be so negative.
It might be fun.
Watch out!
- What are you doing?
- A- drain.
- Shit!
Thanks.
Let' s have some fun.
- Yes, it' s good, I' m just not hungry.
But you like it?
Shall we rent a video?
Or is it too late?
Shall we just forget it?
- I don' t want to.
- You can' t just sit here.
They can go.
The party' s cancelled.
- Wait...
- What' s all this?
- Here, have some.
What party is this?
We got wine and everything.
Yes, but like...
Okay, we' il drink the wine and go.
- Okay.
Cheers.
- Wasn' t anyone there?
- Yes, but they weren' t hungry.
- So they went up to your room.
I have them a little wine.
- Who was it?
- Jessica and Elin.
- No one I know.
- Jessica and Elin?
- Did you lock it?
- Hello!
I' m just...
- Why' d you lock it?
- I' m avoiding her.
We' il just drink up and leave.
I' m just...
I' m just changing pants.
- You' ve got a skirt on!
- I just want to get drunk!
- They' re changing.
- You can go to the lounge.
We' re coming soon.
- Have you heard she' s a lesbian?
- What!
Really?
- Agnes?
Is it true that you' re...
Aren' t you ready?
- I think it' s cool.
- Cool?
- I' m also going to be one.
- Come on!
- I' m going to.
- Open up now!
She' s nice.
- If she' s so nice, go out and neck her.
What do i get if I do?
- If you do what?
- If I neck her?
- You' il get AlDS, probably.
- If I kiss her, will you give me 100?
- You wouldn' t.
- 100.
- But I haven' t got 100.
I' il give you 20.
- Okay.
- But you won' t dare.
You' il have to leave.
Hi.
- Yes.
- Can' t you sit over here.
- Why, what for?
There' s something I want to tell you.
- Can' t you just say it?
- But...
I don' t want Jessica to hear.
Please?
I really don' t want her to hear.
It' s just that...
You' re so pretty.
Jesus, Elin, you' re insane!
That' s disgusting!
Here' s 20.
Have they left?
Have they already left?
No, but we were going to a party and I didn' t want to go.
I don' t want to, I' m tired.
I don' t feel like it.
Fucking hell!
Why' d I do that?
- It was just a joke.
- No, I' m going back.
Fuck that!
We' re going to have fun, I' m drunk.
- Then they kissed each other.
- No!
Is it true?
- You kissed her for 20 crowns?
- Was it worth it?
- Hi babe.
- Good.
- How was it?
- Wicked!
- You kidding!
Was it nice?
- It was horrible, what do you think?
Everyone knows you' re not like that, anyway.
What if her dad answers and comes to the school?
- He could...
- Or her mother.
- Ahlberg.
- Hi, is that Agnes?
I want you to know you make me so hot.
Can' t I come round so we can lick each other or something?
- She' s checking you out.
- No.
Are you an arsehole, or what?
- Are you in love with her?
- No!
Or, yeah...
- Are you braindead?
- You' re in love with her.
Come on!
I' m sorry.
I didn' t mean to.
- Don' t you feel well?
- Leave!
Here.
Thanks.
Jesus, you' re beautiful.
- You' re the most beautiful of all.
- You' re drunk.
- It' s true.
- You' re drunk.
- It' s true.
I like you.
- Get... out the way!
Out the way!
- Take it easy!
- Out the way!
Hey, I didn' t mean to.
Hey... please.
Don' t go.
- Look, mine' s much smaller.
- Markus...
- Smaller maybe, but mine' s thinner.
- It' s smaller and thinner.
Markus, can' t we go?
Agnes.
Come in.
Hi...
I' ve made some tea.
- How are you?
- I' m reading.
- No.
What are you reading?
Ah, Edith Södergran...
"The day sighs into the night"
How does it go?
"Take my arm Take my th..." "Thin shoulder' s longing" - Dad...
'Night.
Agnes!
Agnes.
Hi.
I didn' t mean to do that.
It was really silly.
Had you gone to bed?
Could I use your toilet?
I' m gonna pee myself.
Alright.
Thanks.
No, don' t turn it off.
- I' m so tired of it.
- Can' t you put on something else?
Wow, this is really good.
- Can I use some?
- Sure.
What do you want to hear?
I don' t know...
Is it true you' re a lesbian?
If you are,
I understand, 'cause guys are gross.
I' m also going to be one, I think.
But...
Maybe I should go home.
Shit, let' s go to the party.
I have to anyway 'cause my jacket' s there.
- We' il go and hit someone.
- No, I' m not invited.
So?
We' il burn the house down.
Come on.
Please...
- You want to?
- Yeah.
- What you gonna be when you grow up?
- I don' t know.
I' m going to be a model.
Or I' m gonna be a psychologist.
- I' ve also thought of that.
- Really?
You' re also gonna be that?
Dunno, it seems exciting digging in peoples minds and...
But really, you' il probably find it silly, I' d most like to be a writer.
You can be that too.
You could books about those..... those, like, all that psychic stuff and mass murderers.
But I' d rather be a model.
You think i can be?
Yes.
But I think it' s more fun being a psychologist.
- Am I pretty enough?
- Yes, you are.
I don' t think I want to go to that party.
Why are you so weird?
- You are weird.
- You' re also weird.
- Am I?
- Yes.
Well, not weird but...
I don' t want to be like everyone else.
Though, sometimes I' m just the same,
- But you' re not.
- You know what my nightmare is?
That I' il stay in Åmål.
That I' il never move from here.
All of that.
Then my husband leaves with someone younger -
- and I' m stuck with kids that just scream and nag.
It' s so fucking meaningless.
Where' re you from?
I mean, where' d you live before here?
- Was it fun there?
- Okay...
- More fun than Åmål, anyway?
- Maybe.
- Can I ask you something?
- What?
- Have you been with lots of girls?
- Why' re you asking that?
I was just wondering.
No, I haven' t been with lots of girls if you must know.
- When you kissed me...
- I could die, sorry!
- It was the first time.
- Was it?
- First and last time.
- But that' s completely wrong!
It' s just 'cause you live in fucking Åmål.
It' s so unfair.
If you lived in Stockholm, for example, then...
- Then you' d have loads of girls.
Yes...
- Where' re you going?
- Come.
We' re going to Stockholm.
- You' re not sane!
- 'Course I am,' course I' m sane.
- Okay, but you' re on the wrong side.
- What?
- Stockholm' s that way.
- I see...
- Are you serious?
We say 10 cars from now.
If any stop, we' re going to Stockholm.
- Otherwise, forget it.
- Five.
- 10.
- Five.
Okay, five.
If any of them stop, it' s like God' s telling us.
Idiot!
Watch out!
When I get a car, I' il always stop for hitchhikers.
Shit!
Let' s do it!
- Should we?
Hi.
We' re going to Stockholm.
We live there.
We' ve been visiting our aunt and got money for the train -
- and bought records with the money and can' t get home.
- You can come with me to Karlstad.
- Thanks very much!
No!
It does this sometimes.
I' il just...
What the hell are we doing?
We' re fucking crazy!
- I know.
- But we' re so fucking cool.
What on earth are you up to?
Is this "Candid Camera"?
Out of the car!
It' s freezing.
I should go home.
Mum' s coming home soon and...
But I can call you tomorrow.
Do you want to?
- You sure?
- Yeah...
- Oops, I thought it was Mum.
- What' re you doing?
Have to eat the crips or she' il know we' ve been out.
- Can' t we not have eaten them?
- That would seem odd, she' il wonder.
Elin...
- Where' ve you been?
- Nowhere special.
- Some guy?
- No... yeah.
- Who?
- No one.
- Tell me!
- Stop it.
But, tell me!
- Leonardo DiCaprio is skinny.
- No...
He' s got arms like this!
What about your mascara?
What do you mean "maskara"?
It' s how I do my make- up.
Stop being nasty.
God, you' re silly!
Elin.
Elin.
Elin.
What were you dreaming about?
- A nightmare.
- Didn' t exactly sound like a nightmare.
Did I say anything?
Did I say anything?
Nah.
You said...
You were moaning and going on.
Didn' t sound like a nightmare.
Someone was going to kill me.
- Didn' t sound like that.
- But they were.
I was dreaming, wasn' t I?
So I should know.
I know you' re not a victim of palsy.
I don' t know why I said that.
And that perfume actually smells really good.
- And the wheelchair match.
- Basketball.
- Isn' t the most boring I' ve done.
- Why' d you say it then?
- I don' t know.
- You don' t know?
You know what?
It doesn' t make any difference anymore.
'Cause I' ve never liked you.
And I never will, either.
It' il be so nice to be rid of you.
I won' t need to worry you' il paw someone and be nauseating.
The whole school will found out what you are.
And hey...
Good luck with Elin.
Ahlberg.
- Am I disturbing you?
- No.
- Were you calling him?
- Who?
- No.
There was no one at home.
Come out for a smoke.
Hello?
- Tell me.
- I can' t, it' s impossible.
But, do I know him?
- If I told you you' d be totally...
- Are you going to meet again?
No.
I said I' d call, but I won' t.
Of course you will.
You' re in love.
I can see it.
I' m not at all!
Why can' t you just tell me who it is?
You don' t understand.
You' d hate me, you' d never speak to me again.
You fucking cunt!
- What the hell are you doing!
- I knew you were after Markus!
- It' s not him!
- Who is it, then?!
- No one!
- Tell me!
Tell me!
- Tell me who it is!
Take it easy.
It' s Johan.
- Johan Hult?
- Yes.
- Are you in love with Johan Hult?
- Hysterical!
- You said he was...
- Can' t you change your mind?
Sorry...
I really thought it was Markus!
Go to hell!
Be a fucking cunt yourself!
Sorry!
We' il have number one up here.
Here we go!
Sweets!
Mum...
I' m a lesbian.
- What?
- Homosexual.
I' m just kidding.
We have 1, 000 crowns on the line.
Look at the first page.
- Aren' t you going out?
- No.
Are you fighting again?
- Why do you always fight?
- 'Cause we don' t like each other.
'Cause we' re different.
She' s the biggest drip and I' m the coolest in the world.
- You sure we have the same dad?
- Of course you have!
Let' s not talk about him.
- Haven' t you got a lottery ticket?
- What?
No...
Why are we watching it then?
I thought we' d win a car.
- Why are we looking at it?
- Well, it' s...
Lot' s of reasons.
The music and... other things too.
See how much they win.
Totally meaningless...
- Hello.
- Hi.
What are you doing?
Can' t you come here?
- I don' t know.
Sorry I called you that and stuff.
I didn' t mean to.
I really thought it was Markus.
- I don' t know.
Please...
Yeah...
Johan' s here.
Please...
- Good.
- Shall I talk to Johan?
- No!
Don' t be shy now.
- Yeah, I pump iron every day.
- How much?
98 kg.
Can I talk to you?
Elin' s sitting over there...
I think she wants to talk to you.
- With me?
- Yes.
Just stroll over and talk to her.
- Should I talk to her?
- Yes, talk to her.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Jessica said you wanted to talk to me.
Have you got anything to drink?
- Yes.
- Have you?
Here.
Markus... no...
Markus, control yourself...
- Markus, we were just talking.
- Oh, yeah?
Stop it...
Markus...
- Elin.
- It' s Agnes...
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Sweetheart, how are you?
Has something in particular happened?
Shall we talk about it?
I recognize so much of myself in you.
When I was at your age..... I had no friends, no girls were interested in me.
But then... then all of that changes.
And it becomes the other way around.
Like when I was at the 25 year class reunion last spring.
Well, things had gone quite well for me.
I' d done quite well.
- who was the king of the class then, he' d became nothing.
And those girls who were regarded as the prettiest in the class..... they weren' t noteworthy at all anymore.
You should be glad you' re not someone who has it easy -
- who has no problems, because those people are often uninteresting.
But dad you' re talking, like, in 25 years.
Sorry, but I' d rather be happy now than in 25 years.
Sure, you' re right.
Perhaps it' s not much of a comfort at the moment.
- But, anyway...
- 'Cause in 25 years...
That' s, like, 25 years... it doesn' t exist.
- Are you two in the same programme?
- I' m in Electrics and he' s in Vehicles.
- He was groping you.
- He was doing nothing like that.
- He wasn' t doing that?
- What programme are you going to do?
- I haven' t decided.
- What' s Jessica going to do?
- Child and Leisure.
She' s also applied for Hairdressing, but I don' t think she' il get in.
- Don' t be where I am then!
- Can' t you see it' s embarrassing?
- You' re a mental case.
- Thanks, maybe I am.
You become what you' re with.
I' m going to be a psychologist...
I think so, anyway.
- Psychologist?
- But which programme do I follow?.
- Are you going to be a psychologist?
- Yes.
- You never said so.
- I don' t have to tell you everything.
- Why do you want to be that?
- Because I want to.
Not a chance.
You know what grades you need?
What the hell do you know?
Are you a psychologist?
I just know.
Isn' t it so, Johan?
Yeah...
I don' t know.
It' s probably like that.
- You probably need good grades.
- You don' t have a chance.
No?
I' il be a mechanic instead, you need really good grades for that!
Something that would suit you.
You need a double A+.
- You' re a pain.
- What you mean, "pain"?
Is it free here?
- What did she want?
- I don' t know.
What did she want?
- You were going to call.
- What' re you talking about?
- Why' d she hit...?
- What the hell you doing? Are you mad?
Fucking dyke!
- Agnes slapped Elin.
- Why?
- She' s in love with you.
- What?!
How' d you...?
She has been for a long time.
She' s written about you.
It' s true!
Monday:
Why am I so stupid?
Why do I love Elin?
I love her and I hate her [at the same time].
I love her so my heart nearly breaks.
But no one' s ever hurt me like her.
Did it hurt?
Yeah, a little.
- But it was nice too.
- Was it?
Yeah, it was really nice.
I' m so damn happy.
I can' t belive it' s true.
Let' s show some energy, this isn' t a fucking old people' s home.
I want passes on the blade, I want sweat...
This isn' t a youth hostel for mummy' s boys.
Let' s get tough!
- How was it?
Did it hurt?
- Not especially.
I said it did so he' d feel sorry for me.
He stoppped just when it was getting good.
- He was at it for about five seconds.
Although he' s getting better now.
- And it was over.
- Pffftt?
- Jessica, Jessica!
- Markus!
- Are you happy?
- Sure I am.
I think he' s really nice.
If I wasn' t with Markus then...
- I mean...
- Oops...
I just think he' s nice.
He' s not like Markus who' s always trying to be tough.
- Why' re you together with him, then?
It' s...
It' s him and me.
It' s just like that.
Look how cute he was as a kid.
Johan thought I' d slept with loads of guys.
When I told him I was a virgin he was shocked.
- Why' d he think that?
- Markus had said that.
- Markus told him?
- Yeah...
He' s such a moron.
He always goes around bullshitting!
- I' il talk to him.
- Doesn' t matter.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- Are you upset?
- No.
You' re so exasperating!
You change your mind the whole time!
First, you don' t even like Johan.
- Then you' re suddenly in love with him.
- God you go on...
No, but you' re never satisfied.
You always get what you want.
Get what I want?
What the hell do you know about that!
What you reckon?
Is she pretty or what?
Alright.
Not bad...
- Nice breasts.
- And her pussy?
What do you think of her pussy?
She' s totally deranged.
She put her hand on my thigh and felt me up.
- Yeah?
And?
- Nice picture you put up.
- She' s a bloody headcase.
- Yeah...
Mum, what does lesbian mean?
What?
Why are you asking?
Kalle said that someone is one.
- Who?
- It' s someone who...
Well, it means that if you are a girl... or rather, a woman...
If you' re a woman you like other woman.
Instead of like... mum, I like dad...
But if you are a lesbian or..... it' s also called homosexual, then maybe two woman like each other.
Instead of like with mum and dad where it' s a man and a woman.
- Do you have to go to hospital?
- Hospital?
No, not at all.
There' s nothing wrong at all, you' re just...
You' re like everyone else.
- Who is it that...?
- Kalle says..... that his brother says that..... Agnes is a lesbian.
Agnes?
That' s the most ridiculous...
She' s not at all.
Why' m I so stupid?
Why do I love Elin?
- Is it true?
- Yes.
You' ve, like, read...
You' ve, like, you' ve gone into my room...
- I' m sorry.
I regret it deeply.
But I' d still like us to talk about what I read.
Stop!
I don' t want to hear more.
I don' t want to talk to you.
You can leave.
- Please Agnes.
- Leave!
- Agnes...
- Out!
Leave!
I didn' t do it out of spite.
I did it because I was worried about you.
Ivar 29... two nine...
We' re talking horizontal lines...
Niklas 35... three five...
It' s the wrong number all the time.
Oscar 64... six four...
- Fucking hell!
- Quiet.
- Can' t we do something else?
- Quiet.
- You bloody idiot!
- Shit, Elin!
Moron!
Gustav 53... five three...
So, you punch in the number....
You press here.
- Where' ve you been?
"Where' ve you been"...
I can do what I like, or maybe I can' t?
- Sure, I was just wondering.
- Really interesting...
- Girls don' t understand stuff like this.
- What don' t we understand?
- Like... mobiles.
- Why don' t understand mobile phones?
- Ouch.
Sorry.
- You' re an idiot.
What?
It' s not so strange.
You' re great at things we don' t understand.
Like what, for instance?
- Make- up.
- You think that' s all we do!
- I don' t know.
- What else?
- What else are we interested in?
- Stuff like looks, clothes...
Stuff like make- up and looking good.
You' re such a fucking idiot!
And you?
Why' re you sitting without saying anything?
What do you think?
- I don' t know.
- Do you think the same as him?
- What do you mean?
Do you think the same as Markus?
Of course.
I mean, we stick together, don' t we?
- Don' t tell him what he should think.
- What' s up with you now?
- Can' t you talk?
What do you think?
- I don' t know.
You' re an idiot as well.
- Jesus, I' m sick of of you.
- What the hell have I done now?!
- Hello, it' s Markus.
- Can I talk to Johan?
- It' s for you.
- Hello, this is Johan.
I don' t want to be with you anymore.
It' s over.
You can go home.
- I hate my life.
- Why' d you break up with Johan?
- I' il never be with anyone.
- He' s far too good for you.
- I' m going to be celibate.
A- drain.
- Grow up.
Acne, abortion alcoholism, anorexia...
- You still at nursery school?
- Anal sex, asthma, AlDS...
- Hello, you' re standing on one too.
- This is a C- drain.
You just thinks it means cupid.
Know what it means?
- It means crap.
- Move off it.
- And condyloma and cancer.
- You irritate me.
- Must you always do the opposite?
- We' il test it.
Do this.
Abortion... acne... anal sex...
No, I don' t feel anything.
No anal sex...
You' re not normal.
You' re not fucking normal!
It' s Elin.
- Hi.
- I just wanted to say...
I' m in love with someone else...
Who is it?
- Stop it!
What are you doing!
- I must talk to you.
I must talk to you...
It' s really important.
Please, please.
Please!
What do you want to say?
I was the one that threw the stone.
I' m sorry.
I didn' t mean to break it.
I wanted...
I wanted to talk to you.
I didn' t mean to...
Because you probably think..... I think you are a bad person, but it' s not like that.
It' s completely the opposite.
Actually I think that you' re... you' re good.
- Are you winding me up?
I have...
I have been thinking and things..... a lot... about you.
- If you' re foooling me again I' il kill you.
- I' m not.
I' m not, I' m not fooling you.
And, yes...
Is it true that you...?
Victoria said that you were..... in love with me.
Because..... if you are, then I am too.
In you, that is...
Are you?
Hurry up!
I' il just...
- It' s broken.
- What?
There' s something wrong with the flushing.
- Use another.
- Are you on your period?
Is that the only joke you know?
- Use another one, I said.
- Okay, I' ve got it.
Jessica!
What' re you doing?
- What?
- Elin' s with a guy in the toilet.
- What the hell are you talking about?!
- But that' s why, isn' t it?
- Come on, Jessica.
Elin!
Bloody morons!
What the hell are we going to do?
Elin.
Let us in so we can see who it is!
- Open up!
We want to know!
- Elin, come out.
- Elin' s with a guy in the toilet.
- Who is it?
No one knows.
I think it' s Johan.
- No, it' s over.
- Over?
Come on we can' t wait.
- What' s going on?
- It' s Elin with a guy.
- Come on, stop it.
Maybe if we said that we were just going to...
No, I don' t know...
- Is it Tomas?
- Tomas!
Is that the best you can do?
We can' t sit here all day this is totally weird.
- What should we do?
- We walk out, of course.
Elin...
- Where' s Elin, I have to talk to her.
- In the toilet with a guy.
- For real?
- We thought it was you.
Johan.
Johan, wait.
Johan... forget about her.
She' s just a fool and you' re far too good for her.
Hey...
- Cut this out.
What' s going on?
- Nothing.
- Of course there is.
- Elin, come on!
Come on.
Let' s go out.
But...
Did you really mean what you said before?
Yes...
Hey...
Shall I open it?
- Make a move!
Come out.
This is my new girlfriend.
Please move.
We' re gonna go fuck now.
Is it okay?
It' s not too strong?
I usually make it too strong.
Jessica gets mad!
I use two grams of milk and 5, 000 kg of chocolate.
And it' s always nearly black and then...
Then I usually pour in more milk, but then the glass isn' t big enough.
But that doesn' t matter.
*** End ***
They were my two best friends in the whole world.
For five weeks.
It was a total accident we even met.
Me, a bum from Brooklyn using phoney frequent- flyer miles.
Tony Croft was kind of a golden boy from Harvard School of Architecture.
We met Lewis McBride, this long- haired Greenpeace tree- hugger guy.
So the plan was to party till we ran out of cash in Malaysia.
It was a paradise of rum, girls, and good, cheap hash.
I don' t understand a word you' re saying to me.
But this is my least favourite part anyway, the talking stuff.
- Do you know what I mean?
- Hm.
You do?
Good morning, bro '.
What' s up?
Did you sleep good, you little dreamer?
What did you do that for?
It' s my last day, Lew.
Get up.
We' il go do some stuff.
- Maybe it shouldn' t be your last day.
- Maybe it shouldn' t.
Maybe you should get a haircut.
- Wow!
- You' re up early.
- What kind of party' s this?
- My party.
Your party?
It' s your aggressive instincts.
I can hear them.
- Where you boys from?
America?
- Malaysian for, "Do you have money?"
- Yes, we' re from the States.
- You have fun here?
Uh, it could be better.
Listen, I got something special for you.
- Yeah?
What?
- I got special animal potion.
- You want?
- Animal potion?
Keep you hard as a rock all night.
You want?
Thanks.
It' s all right.
- Yeah, I want to see this.
- You want to see.
- Your friend?
You want to see?
Yeah.
- OK.
Follow me.
- I' il tell you what this is about.
All right, this is good.
This is all good.
Lewis, this doesn' t look like the number one pharmacy to me.
Hey, yo!
Brother, yo!
- Special delivery for you.
- Oh, this is good.
Good stuff.
Original.
Good.
Very good.
- This is rhino horn, isn' t it?
- Ah, smart man.
Rhino horn good.
American, Japanese like it.
Come on.
- You take it.
Listen, listen.
Woman like it.
Keep you hard.
Good.
Even if this worked...
You listen to me.
If this worked, which it doesn' t, you' re murdering an endangered species.
- They' re not gonna get that.
- Yo, yo!
- I know you' re trying to make a buck...
Ten bucks!
It doesn' t have to get fuckin 'violent.
I' m talking to you.
- You listen!
Hey, man!
Fuck!
What the fuck is up, man?
Get the fuck out of here.
- Easy.
OK.
Stop moving the bike.
You' ve got to balance it.
- Slow it down!
- This is a really steep hill.
- Brake!
Are you all right, man?
Are you all right?
- Are you OK?
Oh, my God.
Holy shit, bro '.
Thanks for the help, guys.
Are you gonna push that back to Penang?
- Let the bike go, brother.
- I' m not gonna leave it.
Lewis, the deposit we put down on that bike is five times its worth.
Why are you pushing the fucking bike?
I' m not gonna leave it.
This is his bread and butter.
- You' re out of your mind.
- Maybe if you helped me out.
- We' d go so much quicker.
- Here, I' il push it.
Here.
Thank you.
- You know what?
Nice shot, Sheriff.
Really.
- [Lewis]
Come on.
Friends for life, man.
- You guys gotta give me your addresses.
- Yeah, give me yours.
When I get mine, I' il give you my address, down there in Borneo.
- Where?
Borneo.
You got a girlfriend there, man?
No.
I got the Orang- utan Reintroduction Project.
- The what project?
- This group rescues orang- utans that have been kept as pets, and integrates them back in the wild.
I' m gonna go down and volunteer.
Bro ', if the apes need humans to save them, then they' re fucked.
Pay no attention to him.
He' s always dumping on somebody.
- That' s cool.
- What about you, golden boy?
You can' t wait to put all those things you call buildings up in New York.
Skyscrapers.
No, man, they' il be beautiful.
Touching the clouds.
You guys don' t realise how good you have it right now, right here.
So eager to get on with your charmed lives that you miss what' s happening now.
You know what I mean?
We got mellow hash, right?
We got coconuts filled with rum.
We got beautiful, gracious chicks that like us just cos we' re Yankees and tall.
- Some of us.
- And you' ve got this warm, calm water.
It' s like God' s own bathtub or something, man.
Hey, Lew, are you really gonna stay here and try to save those gorillas?
- Yeah.
- That' s cool, man.
That' s totally cool, Lew.
Totally cool.
You sound, uh, interested.
You wanna join me?
The flight' s tomorrow.
No refund.
Think about it.
- Morning.
- Hey, good morning, man.
- How do you feel?
- Good, good.
Is it civilisation and its discontents or uh... you, me and the monkeys?
I don' t think I' m cut out for that kind of thing, Lew.
That' s for you, man.
To tell you the truth...
I don' t have that kind of stuff in me.
Well, I think you' re wrong about yourself, but...
- Give 'em hell.
- Where are you gonna go?
New York is calling you home.
Martinis, pretty girls, the Yankees.
Or do you want to stay here?
Don' t smoke it all in one bowl.
I got Tony' s.
I wouldn' t take Excedrin out of this country.
- Why did we buy so much hash?
- At those prices we had to.
Well, I guess this is it, man.
Yeah?
- See ya, buddy.
Good luck.
- I' m gonna miss you guys.
Bullshit.
You' il find a couple of chimps prettier than both of us.
You fucker.
Take care.
- I' il see you.
- All right.
Safe travels.
Yeah, Gaby, listen.
Yeah.
OK.
You know what?
No, I just, you know, I can' t talk about anything right now.
No, I' m not interested in discussing this right now.
I got two people in the back of my car.
I' m working.
Gaby, maybe when this shift' s over, I' il call you, we' il grab a bite, OK?
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Bye.
Yeah, it' s Four, under way.
Can you sling a pick- up at the Stanhope?
Lady named Eastern, asked for you.
Eastern?
Eastern, yeah.
Where' s the drop at?
She didn' t say.
Fuck!
I apologise for the sudden stop, folks, but hopefully you were belted in.
OK.
Here we are.
Take that.
Pleasure serving you as always, Mr Homer.
- This is Ravitch.
- Hey, it' s Sheriff.
How much is a famous divorce attorney worth to you?
He' s worth squat, brother.
I' m single.
What if he' s out boinking and getting bombed and his wife' s not with him?
- That' s a different story.
- Ravitch, can' t you find another desk?
- I say two bills.
- You' re a cheap son of a bitch.
- Grab a pen.
- I' m sorry.
OK, give it to me.
Thank you.
We headed anywhere in particular?
How about we just drive around the park for a bit?
Around the park.
I never forget a face.
Do you mind if I smoke in the car?
It' s the only place in town left that you can smoke.
Go ahead.
So who recommended me, Miss Eastern?
- Please call me Beth.
Who recommended me, Beth?
- Lewis McBride.
- Lew?
Did he say to look up old Sheriff when you got to town?
- How did you know where to find me?
- Lewis said you lived in Brooklyn.
- Yeah, huh?
And odds were I' d still be stuck in Brooklyn, which obviously I am.
So where is Lew?
Is he in town here?
Sheriff, the day you and Tony left Penang, a man came looking for a bike you guys had rented.
He brought the police.
Only they didn' t find the bike, but they did find 104 grams of hashish, some stashed in the hut, some in the trash.
Jesus Christ.
And Lewis caught hell for that, huh?
Yeah.
He' s spent the last two years in prison.
Jesus Christ.
What a nightmare that must be, huh?
Is he still in prison now?
- For eight more days, yeah.
- I wish I' d have known sooner.
I don' t know if I could have done anything but...
At least he' s getting out in eight days though, huh?
That' s not the case.
Anybody found with more than 100 grams of hashish is considered to be trafficking.
What is that, like, dealing?
Sheriff, in order for Lewis not to be considered a dealer, you and Tony have to fly back to Penang and accept your share of the responsibility.
What happens to us?
The deal was that if both of you go back, it' s three years apiece, and if only one of you goes back, it' s six.
Wait.
It' s three?
It' s six?
Finish that sentence for me please.
Six years in prison.
Let me make this clear to you.
In Malaysia, dealers get death.
Jesus Christ, for a shitty brick of hash?
- So in eight days from now...
- Lewis McBride is going to hang.
What are you, his lawyer?
I' m his American lawyer, yeah.
So how about we have dinner and talk more about this?
I' m on till 2: 00.
But thank you very much.
- Drinks then?
- At 2: 00?
Don' t you sleep?
- I want to do this more.
Breakfast?
- Can' t.
- Lunch?
- I pulled a day shift.
Tomorrow night.
Here.
Say 7: 00?
- Tomorrow at 7: 00.
- Night.
Thanks.
- Excuse me, I' m looking for Tony Croft.
- Yeah, he' s up top.
Thanks.
So if you don' t go back, Tony, Lewis will hang.
Sorry.
You can' t come out of nowhere and tell me the bottom' s dropped out of my life and I' ve got a week to brace for the impact.
I' m sorry, Tony.
That' s exactly what I am doing.
How come it took you guys two years to tell me this?
Lewis never mentioned the two of you.
Not when he was convicted two years ago, not when he was sentenced to death.
It was only last week when his final pardon appeal was rejected.
I found a detective, the second he found you, here I am.
You gotta understand, this isn' tjust about me, all right?
Like anybody, I have a lot of responsibilities.
I have a fiancée.
I want to start a family.
Family' s wonderful.
Lewis would like to have kids too.
If you can postpone having yours for a few years, he' il have that chance.
I' m staying at the Stanhope.
Could you call me there tonight?
I will.
Thanks, Tony.
- This is Beth.
- Miss Eastern?
Hi.
It' s Tony Croft.
- Tony, hi.
- Listen.
Kerrie and I talked this over and we want to, um...
Well, first of all I wanna say... this is ridiculous.
There is no way in hell that I' il do the six years.
But if Sheriff agrees to go back...
Um... well, that' s another...
In that case, um... you know, it' d be pretty hard to say no.
What you' ve said has been very clear.
I' m about to have dinner with Sheriff.
I' il call you in the morning.
- All right.
I' il talk to you then.
- Thank you, Tony.
Good night.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Surprised I showed?
- No.
Why?
- Cos I am.
- Eastern party?
- Yeah.
- Right this way.
Thanks.
- Would you care for a cocktail?
- Glass of house red.
- OK.
- I' il have a rum and Coke, please.
Thank you.
Rum and Coke.
- Yes, I did.
Tony said he was going to go back.
Yeah?
Tony said he was going to call me when he got back from Penang.
So...
So what are you saying?
I can' t count on Tony' s word?
Just, uh...
I think it' s good Tony says he' s going back.
How come?
- Because I' m...
Your drinks.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
Tony' s only going back if you' re going back.
- You didn' t say that.
- I didn' t finish.
OK, please finish then, Beth.
Finish what you were going to say.
I don' t expect you to do this without some sort of compensation.
Both of Lewis' s parents have passed on.
They left a little something.
How does $50, 000 sound? $50, 000?
Just fine.
But for each year. $50, 000 a year.
You want me to pay you $150, 000 for assuming what is, in fact, your share of the responsibility?
No, not you.
Lewis' s estate.
I mean, they got the heavy money, right?
You come to New York on what was pretty much a fishing expedition.
You stay on the Park, eat here, not some coffee shop.
All right.
So I will draw up the draft agreement tomorrow.
If you promise me right now that you' re going to go back.
Really funny?
People like you think you can just buy people like me.
But guess what.
I wouldn' t walk into your shit storm for any price.
Any chance there might have been that I' d go back went bye- bye when you tried to pay me off.
- Menus?
- I' m sorry.
There' s been a mistake.
Because then I would be exploiting you.
Good night.
I' m sorry.
I didn' t mean to insult you.
You insulted yourself.
We' re finished.
I would make any play to save Lewis' s life.
I know you care about that.
Don' t let my nickname fool you.
It' s a bastardisation of my name, Volgecherev.
I keep my mouth shut and my head down.
But I do wish Lewis luck.
But I am persistent.
Don' t waste it on me.
You' ve only got a few days left.
You' re appealing to emotions I don' t have and morality I can' t afford.
That doesn' t change the fact that a man' s life hangs in the balance.
Good night.
How' re you doin ', man?
What' s up, Sheriff?
How' re you doin ', Tony?
Yep.
Here we are.
- Look, I' m freezing.
My secretary' s out today.
I apologise for the inconvenience.
You' il have to seat yourself.
So this is the office, huh?
Let' s just sort this out without that lawyer breathing down our necks.
- She' s pretty intense, huh?
- No shit, man.
After she ambushed me, I couldn' t eat for two days.
My girlfriend forced some toast down my throat this morning.
That' s kind of a dry run for our next three years in Penang Prison.
So you' re gonna do this?
You' re going back?
No.
You don' t give a shit, do you?
- You think I don' t care about Lewis?
- That' s what you' re acting like.
You don' t know the first thing about me.
Fine.
Then how come you' re so ready to slam the door on him?
I know something about guys who have clubs and badges.
I' ve had my ass kicked by those bastards.
It' s not how you think.
Doing something good doesn' t mean there' il be a happy ending.
- You could very easily die over there.
- Yeah.
- You think of that?
- This is the other side of the coin.
If this goes down, God forbid, and Lewis hangs, you don' t think this is gonna be headline news?
Sheriff, this is gonna follow you around the rest of your life.
Whereas the other way we come home heroes and the city throws us a parade?
You really are.
Listen to me, OK?
Lewis would have gone back for either of us.
You know that.
That' s why I' il never be mistaken for Lewis McBride.
- Afternoon, Miss Eastern.
- Thank you.
Beth Eastern?
Hi.
I' m MJ Major, a reporter for the New York Examiner.
- You' re a what?
- A reporter.
Really?
And what would you want with me?
I know the hanging' s in less than a week.
Press is exactly what you and the family need for a public outcry.
- The family wants this kept quiet.
- Really?
In this instance, your interests and the interests of the public converge.
- How did you find out about this?
- My sources at the State Department.
There' s a blackout at the State Department.
They sold it as diplomacy.
I can make this happen fast.
- In 48 hours, Lewis McBride can be...
- No.
The American kid who graffitied a car?
Because of the media frenzy, they had to cane the kid.
That was a caning.
To show some national backbone.
- This is a hanging.
- I know that.
Some Aussie dope dealer' s mother went on every talk show from Sydney to London.
They hung her son a week early to shut her up.
Excuse me, I' ve got a really big week.
Beth, I can make miracles happen in a week.
Don' t do this.
Don' t do it.
- Wait a minute.
Why...
- What?
Jesus Christ!
I' m sorry.
I' m very sorry.
Just...
Can I have that, please?
- Is he boyish?
- What?
Is he cute?
Is he clean- cut?
- Cos if I put him on the front page...
- Give me some time.
Give me some time, some space, and I' il give you your story.
When?
Soon.
I' m gonna call you, Beth.
What are you doing here?
- I have a tape I want you to watch.
- Yeah?
Jesus Christ, you don' t let up, do you?
- You know what?
I' m gonna watch this.
Honest to God I am.
But I was actually gonna go get something to eat.
So I' il watch it later.
Are you inviting me to dinner, or are we still mad at each other?
Both.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
It' s a toast to Lewis.
Sweet guy.
Loved the animals.
Loved his beer.
- Did he?
- He did.
I never knew that about him.
Tell me something else.
- Beer is all I really remember.
- That' s it?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
- He didn' t leave an impression then.
- Lewis?
Are you kidding me?
- Have you spent a lot of time with him?
- I' ve never had a beer with him.
He is, honestly, Beth, one of the sweetest people I' ve ever met.
Lewis is the kind of guy...
You' d have a beggar on the street, and he' d just... he' d touch them somehow, talk to them.
The guy could have an illness, language barrier, whatever it was.
He just could see people, I guess.
Got a big heart.
Yeah.
That' s nice.
What else can you tell me about him?
You are good, aren' t you?
Oh, Sheriff, what do you think about me?
I don' t know.
You seem to think I have all these wiles and stratagems.
I don' t.
I have a man' s life in my hands.
I get that.
But let me ask you a question, Beth.
And ask yourself this honestly.
Would you go back?
I wouldn' t ask you or Tony to do this if I hadn' t already answered the question for myself.
Yeah.
But I guess, you know, I don' t think you could ever honestly answer that unless you were in that situation yourself.
- Hi, Gaby.
- I' m not a piece of dirt you get off on then flush down the john, all right?
He' il fuck you and then sneak out, by the fire escape if he has to.
Unless you' re some whore.
I' m his wife.
What?
Fuck you for not wearing a ring.
That' s my friend Gaby.
Wow.
Good thing you didn' t give her a social disease.
We' d all be dead.
- Thanks, Frank.
I appreciate it.
- So when did you guys tie the knot?
You know what, Frank?
Get the hell outta here, will you?
- OK?
- Yeah.
- Well, that was fun.
- That was something.
"I' m his wife."
You left this on the table.
- Please watch it.
I will.
Good night.
OK.
OK, Lewis, go ahead.
Hey, guys.
Sheriff.
Tony.
Long time, huh?
I guess if you' re seeing this tape you' ve kind of figured that my vacation plans... changed.
I was set to go off and try and save the orang- utan, do what I can.
Kind of ironic, isn' t it?
Look who' s caged and... they say soon to be extinct.
Um... this little docudrama here was not my idea.
I' m sorry, but, um... the folks at the American Citizen Service have done all they can and now they tell me that you guys are my last chance.
So...
I don' t know if you' re even thinking about coming back.
But if there' s the slightest chance, I will tell you this.
I haven' t been. uh... harmed in any way.
I haven' t been tortured... except by boredom and hunger.
There' s not a whole lot of good stuff to eat.
No burgers for you, Sheriff.
But, uh...
There' s rice.
Your rice needs definitely will be met.
But, um...
If you do...
I already do, just for asking you.
But... at least I won' t feel the fear, and I know that' s not fair.
Um... so that' s why I' m doing this.
[hissing, whirring]
- Hey!
- I' m busy!
- Yeah, well, I can' t take you either.
Pop, remember that trip I took a couple of years back, to Malaysia?
Yeah, I remember.
Some sleaze was selling frequent- flyer miles, right?
That' s not the point.
The point is this guy is still over there in Penang.
He' s kind of a pal.
But anyway, they' re gonna hang him.
They found some hashish on him.
But some of the hash was mine.
I' d have to serve three years in prison, Penang Prison.
But if I don' t go back, they hang this guy.
They don' t hang guys for hashish.
I' m not that naive.
You' re leaving something out.
I' m not leaving anything out, Dad.
That' s the way it is over there.
All right.
So maybe you' re right and I' m wrong.
You still want my advice in this hanging stuff?
- Yeah.
- It feels like an easy call.
If you weren' t wasting your life here, it might be different.
But this pal you' il save, odds are he' s worth more than you.
So my advice, you go, you do the time.
What' s the matter?
You look sick.
You' re supposed to beg me not to go back.
It' s just not what I expected to hear, I guess.
I' m just yanking your crank.
Why put yourself through the agony when you know you' re not going?
What are we, suckers here?
No, they did what?
They weighed him?
For what?
Jesus.
I have to get the call.
It might be one of the guys.
We' il talk tomorrow?
This... this is Beth.
You sound stressed.
This is MJ Major.
Is this a bad time?
No, it' s not a bad time.
Beth, what' s wrong?
How can I help?
You want to know how you can help?
Just leave me alone.
I' ve got the resources to a daily paper with worldwide readership.
We are picked up by the International Herald Trib.
We could be doing anything you want.
Photographs, articles, petitions...
A death warrant.
Now, I' ve asked you nicely to stay out of this until after the hearing.
If I don' t get something from you soon, I' il go straight to your two guys.
You don' t know who they are, or you' d already be there.
- I' m hanging up.
Beth, I' m gonna need to hear from you very soon.
You will.
Well, hi.
I didn' t expect to see you.
Come on in.
Thanks.
How are you doing?
- Couldn' t be better.
- Yeah?
Please give me some good news.
Did you get my message about dinner?
Yeah, I got your message but I can' t make dinner.
I got plans.
The tape.
OK.
- Did you watch it?
- Yeah, I watched the whole thing.
I did a lot of soul- searching last night with this.
And I figure you' ve got to know sooner than later because of everything.
I just wanted to come and let you know where you stand with me.
That' s good.
Where do I stand with you?
He' s halfway to Penang already.
I think he just needs a nudge.
I think he' il probably go back.
You know, I looked inside, deep inside, Beth, to find something, but, uh... it isn' t in me.
Oh, it isn' t... in you.
Write that down for me.
Just a few words.
Letter from a pal.
Listen, I... "Searched my soul" was the best part for me.
That' s great.
He' d love to know that you searched your soul before you decided not to go.
Yeah.
They just told me that they weighed Lewis today for the trap doors of the gallows.
- Beth...
- Get out of here.
Get the fuck out of here, Sheriff.
- Sheriff is here.
How' re you doing?
- I did.
A thing at Lincoln Center.
You know what I mean?
But here I am.
Ready to discuss.
What did I order?
Sheriff, this is Kerrie, my fiancée.
Kerrie, John Volgecherev.
Kerrie, nice to meet you.
You' re not as platinum as I expected you to be.
Listen, Sheriff...
It' s pretty obvious that you have no intention of going back, right?
Where?
- Is he drunk?
- Oh, you mean, like, back to prison.
Right, well, I' ve never actually been.
Do you have a fork I could use?
I' ve never been to prison, thus, I can' t go back to somewhere I' ve never been.
Thank you.
That is brilliantly unhelpful.
- Yes.
- Beth, I checked.
Penang Prison is at a third- world level of sanitation, nutrition, rice rations don' t meet minimum...
Lewis is provided with food from Amnesty International.
So would Tony be.
- Inmates have been tortured.
- He hasn' t been.
- Inmates have died of typhus.
- Because of overcrowding.
Lewis has his own cell, as would Tony, and Sheriff if he goes back.
That' s really good.
And the other thing I think you' ve overlooked is that that building' s not up to code.
- Oh, Jesus.
- What are you, the class clown?
And who are you to tell them to give up their freedom?
I represent a boy sentenced to death.
For the sake of some client, you demand...
No, no, no.
I have not demanded anything.... that they endure three or six years of God knows what.
That' s insane.
Yeah, it' s insane, OK?
- I' m gonna go back.
- What?
OK?
I' m sorry, honey.
In the middle of this, what matters?
That Lewis doesn' t die.
Somebody' s got to do something.
Please.
Where' s the document that guarantees this deal?
The Attorney General of Malaysia has agreed...
Why don' t we have a copy?
- It' s an oral agreement.
- No.
Tony goes nowhere till we have that document.
I wish they did.
I cannot get anything to you in writing.
Don' t.
I' il be at home if you want me.
I' m sorry.
She' s just scared, all right?
She' s more scared than I am.
You' re gonna have to excuse me.
If I' m gonna get her to wait three years for me...
I shouldn' t keep her waiting tonight.
Tony, what can I say?
Thank you.
Sure.
All right, Tony.
- See you, man.
- See you later.
Good luck with that.
Right, Sheriff.
I' il go talk to the firm.
Well, quite a party.
- Are you gonna go back to your hotel?
- Oh, yes.
Give them the good news.
So I guess Lew' s gonna be OK then, huh?
Which means, you know...
You' re off the hook?
- I' m off the hook, huh?
- Good night.
Jaffe, I want a follow- up on the Canarsie fire.
- It' s my pleasure.
I' d like some pictures of the shopkeeper, burnt out.
You got it.
MJ, where' s my pension fund fraud?
I thought you had a CPA who was ready to talk.
And she' s given me gold.
I' m just fact- checking a few points.
And I' m looking for a source called Sheriff.
Ring anybody' s bell?
Sheriff?
Let' s go, then.
- [Sheriff]
Yeah?
It' s Beth.
I talked to the garage and they said you called in sick.
- Can I come up and see you?
- Uh... sure.
- Hi.
- Hi there.
- Hi there.
- I brought some goodies from Zabar' s.
Cure you right up.
Should I beware of lawyers bearing gifts?
Think I' m gonna have a beer.
Do you want one?
Uh... beer?
Sure.
You' re quite the avid reader, aren' t you?
- Or is this just...
- Yeah, just for showing off.
All the visitors I have.
I keep my place real impressive, don' t I?
It' s nice.
The books are a recent development.
When I was in school, I tried to avoid reading.
Then I graduate and realise I don' t know shit.
Who does?
- You know what I mean?
So anyway, I start getting the books and... do some reading, learn about the world around me.
Just trying to be civilised I guess, Beth.
That' s good.
Lewis said you were better than you thought you were.
That kind of thing.
Where' s your passport?
- What?
- I just want to see your passport.
In case it' s not good.
I can renew it tomorrow on an emergency basis if you decide something different.
So when you said about me being off the hook, you were just lying to my face?
I think you were lying to yourself.
Only a total bastard would let Tony go back alone.
Yeah, well, I' m not in charge of Tony.
- I' m not his dad.
- I know that.
But Tony' s a man who' s got...
Tony' s a great guy.
But he' s got a future and a sexy fiancée.
Yeah.
Six years under any circumstances would be hard as hell, but this case, it' s inconceivable.
I think Tony' s a man of his word.
Tony called me three days ago and told me that he couldn' t do six years.
I know what he said last night.
I applaud his idealism.
I can' t count on it.
I have to have you on that plane, Sheriff.
Please show me your passport.
No that it' s any of your business, but my passport' s good.
- It is?
Show it to me.
- Take my word for it.
Show it to me.
You' d take three years from me but you wouldn' t take my word?
OK.
I pushed it.
I' m sorry.
I trust you.
You know what?
You' re gonna go for me if you don' t have a client?
Wh...
What?
You offer me money and I don' t take that so you figure, "Why don' t I fuck the guy cos then he' il do what I want."
That' s exactly me.
That' s actually exactly me.
I' il get you to go back because I' il give you a little sex.
That' s me.
- Go fuck yourself.
- Whoo!
That' s fun.
I' m the guy who' s gotta clean up.
That' s fun.
- Have fun, Sheriff.
Shut up!
You' re too noisy!
You fucking crazy bastard!
Shut up!
You' re making too much goddamn noise!
Open the door!
Open the door, you fucking pussy!
Open the fucking door!
- [Beth]
Sheriff, that' s enough!
I' m calling the cops.
Sheriff.
Turnabout' s fair game, huh?
Now that you' re news, all' s fair.
Taking pictures of me?
- I' il bust your fucking face open!
- I' m doing my job, man.
I' m doing my job!
- Get the fuck outta my face.
I' il sue your ass.
Please?
- Is that your photographer?
- Is that Sheriff?
Are you gonna print pictures now?
This story is about to blow wide open, OK?
I found this story first, I' m gonna print it first, period.
Your story could cost Lewis' s life.
Do you understand that?
You give me three days - three days - until the hearing is over, OK?
You promise me that you will not talk to a soul and that I have Lewis exclusively.
Exclusive.
You promise me you' re gonna hold off on the story.
Three days, Beth.
Slow down, driver.
You' re making me nervous.
It' s a bad habit I got.
I was all mellowed out but you fucked that up.
I hope you' re not gonna say I can' t smoke.
It' s the only place left in town you can smoke.
What the fuck are you doing?
Smoking crack?
Crack is for our African- American brethren.
This is pure rock cocaine.
If you don' t like it, driver, you can raise the partition.
- I can?
- Whatever you want to do.
You want to see what I want to do?
Cocksucker.
What do you want?
I want to see you.
OK.
What' s happening here, Beth?
You tell me, Sheriff.
I can' t take this any more.
So don' t take it.
What do you want?
Oh, my God.
You' re killing me, Beth.
I' m killing you?
You' re killing me.
Sheriff?
Oh, shit.
Sheriff, are you there?
I was just gonna say that I hope that, um... you don' t think last night was about...
Um... could you call me when you get this message?
That' d be good.
All right.
Can I sit next to you on the plane?
Hi, Tony.
Tony?
- You all right?
Yeah, I' m fine.
- Sure?
Do you want to switch with us?
- Yeah, do you want to switch seats?
It' s fine.
Sheriff, I' m a big boy.
I don' t need somebody to hold my hand.
- OK.
- All right.
At least until we get over the Philippines.
Come on, move it, man!
Let' s go!
- Look out!
Maybe we should all wash up, meet in a half hour or so.
Fine with me.
- Is that cool with everyone?
- Yeah, it' s fine.
- I' m right here.
- All right, man.
Hi.
Sheriff...
What' s wrong?
What?
I' m gonna miss you.
I' m gonna miss you.
Only one visitor allowed in there.
- One at a time?
- No, only one today.
- Oh, great.
- What do you want to do?
Do you mind if I go back there and see him?
No, you go.
- Are you sure?
Go ahead.
- Tell him I' il see him soon.
- OK.
Can you come back here?
- I hear you.
- Sheriff?
- Yeah.
Didn' t they tell you I was coming?
I was praying.
I thought you were a dream cos no prayer of mine' s ever been answered here before.
I' il tell you that.
It' s good to see you.
- It' s good to see you.
You too!
- How are you, man?
- I' m better now.
That' s good.
That' s good.
- How are you?
- I' m all right, man.
- You look good.
Nice.
- Spiff on.
You' ve come so far.
Are you thirsty?
Do you want some tea?
- All right.
Let' s have some tea.
- It' s not warm or anything but...
- It' s OK.
- You' re not cold, are you?
- Nah, I' m not cold.
No?
Tony is here to see you too.
He' s outside.
- You see, they took away my blanket.
- Why did they take your blanket away?
Cos they were scared that I was gonna tear it into strips to hang myself.
I said, "Hey, guys, what do you think I' m paying you for?"
Thank you, man.
That' s good tea.
I know why Tony didn' t come in here.
Cos there' s no God in here.
They only let one visitor in at a time.
That' s why I pray now, Sheriff.
Cos...
Out there there' s no need to... to pray where- where- where God' s hand is felt.
You know?
Where God is apparent?
But in here there' s definitely a need to- to pray, t- t- t- to beg, to plead, to sing for... for a sign like...
You know how... how your voice sounds so pretty in the shower?
Because... because there' s nothing else there.
Because it echoes off the walls and it sounds so pretty.
That' s why prayer sounds so perfect in here.
Because it' s so...
Because it' s so totally empty.
Because it' s so... it' s so godless.
It' s so void of... of anything.
And do you know how I know, Sheriff?
Do you know how I know?
I know because... because I...
I ask myself... would I come back for you?
And the only answer is a godless empty evil "No."
I' m sorry I wouldn' t have come back!
- I' m sorry.
It' s OK.
Because I didn' t come back just for you.
I didn' t come back just for you, you know?
Man, it' s OK.
Do you know what I mean?
Come here.
- It' s OK.
- OK, man.
- OK.
All right?
Thanks for the tea.
I liked that.
See you in a couple of hours.
You' il be cleaned up.
It' il be good.
Sheriff.
Yeah?
I knew you' d come back.
Even if you didn' t.
Thank you.
[Tony]
I don' t know how bad it was.
It was not good.
What wasn' t good, the prison or Lewis?
It' s dirty, it' s scary, it' s third- world.
How' s Lewis?
Is he sick?
Is he all there mentally?
Is he the same guy we used to know?
I don' t think he' s lost his mind, but it' s not easy sitting around a cell waiting to hang.
[Tony]
What did he say?
Did he tell you anything?
He just babbled a little bit, Tone.
You know, like, rambled a little bit, you know?
Like stream- of- consciousness stuff.
God' s not in here.
There' s no God in here.
The sound' s beautiful, like singing in the shower.
Basically you' re saying he lost it.
He' s hanging onto anything he possibly can.
- No one' s questioning his courage.
- But his sanity?
You want a way out?
Find one.
But Lewis has always talked that way.
How do...
What do you mean, always?
You' re only his lawyer.
You' ve known him for two years.
24 years.
- I' m his sister.
- What?
He' s my baby brother.
Why didn' t you tell me?
I thought you wouldn' t trust me, Sheriff.
I thought you' d think I' d do anything, that I' d say... say anything, that I' d sell you out, that I' d...
I wanted to tell you.
I tried to tell you.
But you didn' t tell me.
But you didn' t tell me.
Sheriff?
What are we still doing here?
I wish it was that simple, Tony.
I think it' s that simple.
I came back here based on what she told me, OK, and she gave me her word and she lied.
How are we going to trust her, Sheriff?
She drags us into this nightmare, we find out it is her personal nightmare.
I don' t know her.
You don' t know her.
- What?
- I know her.
Like, know her.
Don' t.
Fuck.
All right, I' m an asshole.
No, Tony.
This time I' m the fucking asshole.
Why didn' t you tell me?
What do I owe you to tell you that?
It' s not like it' s been going on forever.
- It happened.
- Listen to me...
Don' t make it like I' m holding out on you because I swear to God I' m not.
Listen to me, Sheriff.
This girl will do anything to get you to do what she needs you to, all right?
Her blood.
She' il lie to you, she' il sleep with you, she' il tell you she loves you.
She' il do anything.
She' il get down on her knees and beg you.
But don' t believe it.
It' s a setup.
If we walk out of here, that boy hangs.
But if we leave, we live.
That' s the one thing I know for sure right now.
He doesn' t have clothes?
Can' t you give him a shower before he turns up in court?
OK.
I...
What can I do for you, sir?
We need two seats on any flight to New York, as fast as possible.
What is it?
I trashed that bike, Tony.
So fucking what?
Get on the plane, Sheriff.
Do you want to rot in one of these prisons?
- I' m gonna take my chances, Tony.
- You don' t have any chances, Sheriff.
This is stupid.
I don' t know, Tony.
You have a safe flight.
- What' s he saying?
- He says they returned but became frightened and may have left.
We request adjournment till the two can be found.
Um... he' s worried about the appearance of preferential treatment.
Hey, Lew.
How are you?
My faith in humanity is half restored.
In returning voluntarily, you are to be commended for your courage.
Is there anything you wish to say to this court, Mr Volgecherev?
Not really, Your Honour.
Just that we were young and stupid, I guess.
But not evil.
I didn' t come back here today because I' m courageous.
I came back here because I' ve been careless for a very long time, and I' m sick of that feeling.
The simple fact, Your Honour, is that I am responsible.
And I' m also scared.
But I am willing to do whatever is necessary... in order for you to spare my friend' s life.
How do you plead?
I' m guilty.
You will be detained in Penang Prison to await sentence.
He asked the prosecutor if he will now reduce the charges.
The prosecutor has agreed.
Chief Justice will be back shortly with his decision.
Beth?
We' re back in session.
- We' re back?
- Yeah.
The Deputy Home Minister is angered about some international news story.
I' m not sure what.
A story that was picked up by the Asian International Tribune.
"In a country proud of its many species of exotic butterflies, a butterfly is about to be broken on a wheel."
"The wheel is Malaysian justice, a term which strikes one American woman as a cruel joke."
- Your Honour...
- "The woman is Beth McBride..."
- I didn' t do this. - "... whose brother was arrested two years ago in Penang."
"Blamed for having bought hashish with two friends, this nature- loving young man now, incredibly, faces death."
- She was determined to write the story.
Silence!
We know you westerners don' t understand our attitude toward drugs.
But we don' t understand yours.
Your cities are decaying, the souls of your young people are stolen from you.
Our laws may seem harsh but our streets remain safe and our youth is protected.
So when an American journalist criticises ourjudicial system...
- Your Honour, I begged her not to.
- Silence!
Lewis McBride... [continues in Malay]
What is he saying?
What is he saying?
He will not amend the charge now.
Lewis must be hanged tomorrow.
What?
Lewis!
You can' t hang him!
- You hang on, Lewis!
- Beth, I love you!
Get your fucking hands off me.
What is the matter with you people?
What is the matter with you people?
You are gonna go straight to hell, you motherfucker!
You lying son of a bitch!
Sheriff!
I don' t wanna die!
No!
You fucking bastards!
I don' t wanna die!
Help!
Please let go of me!
You fucking bastards!
No!
No!
Lewis!
Look up here!
- Sheriff!
- I' m here, Lewis!
I' m right here!
You' re not alone, Lewis!
Look at me, Lewis!
Look at me.
You' re not alone.
I' m here.
See me, Lewis.
You' re not alone.
I' m right here.
I' m right here, Lewis.
I see you, Lewis.
I' m right here.
Lewis, you are not alone right now.
I' m right here.
I see you.
I' m here.
You' re not alone.
You are not alone, Lewis!
OK.
- Where am I going here?
Beth.
- Were you there?
- Yeah.
He wasn' t afraid, Beth.
He walked right past me.
And then I saw him go past all the guards and he was calm.
Tell me the truth.
It was hard.
It was hard.
But, uh...
You know, I think that, uh... he found, at the end, Beth, at the end...
I mean, he was Lewis, you know?
I swear to God, he was at peace with everything.
He was.
I just wish I could have done something.
If I could have been there to do something.
Fight harder.
You did everything you could.
Nobody could have done more.
You' ve gotta believe that.
Nobody did more than you did.
Nobody could have done more.
- You did everything you could.
- You should have gone back with Tony.
Why didn' t you go back with Tony?
I couldn' t go back with Tony.
I couldn' t go back because I knew that you were waiting for me.
And I' m not sorry, Beth.
I' m not.
I don' t think I' d be able to look at you ever again.
And that' d be a lot harder than this shit.
You know what I mean?
I like to look at you.
I like to look at you.
I like to look at you.
The ambassador heard through back channels that when all this publicity dies down, they' re gonna let you go, Sheriff.
They' re gonna do it quietly to save face, but it' s gonna be six months, maximum.
Sheriff?
Yeah.
Oh, goddamn it!
Oh, goddamn it!
Sheriff.
I am gonna take my brother home... and I' m coming right back here.
And I will not leave Penang until you' re with me.
I know.
You ever think about dying?
Yeah.
You?
Some.
Yeah.
Don' t you?
I don' t know.
Yeah, maybe.
Can you believe there' s a heaven if you don' t believe in hell?
I guess you can believe what you want to.
This ranch has been in my family as long as anyone can remember.
My granddaddy used to tell me this was heaven on earth.
Just like his granddaddy used to tell him.
Everything' s changed now since he died.
Appreciate you lighting them candles.
It was the lady.
My mother?
She was here?
She' s left already?
All I ever wanted was to live out there like him...... and work my own spread.
Can' t imagine no better life.
I' ve come to find out Mama aims to sell it.
Says the oil company would pay three times what it' s worth.
Mama lives in San Antonio now with her new husband.
She wants to be in the live theatre.
As your granddaddy' s only child...... your mother inherits outright.
It' s her property.
She can do whatever she wants.
I don' t have any say- so?
What about my father?
They' re divorced.
You could talk to her.
You' re a lawyer.
Well, I have talked to her.
It' s a sorry piece of business, but, son...... not everybody thinks life on a cattle ranch in Texas...... is the second- best thing to going to heaven.
She don' t want to live out there, that' s all.
If it was a paying proposition, that' d be one thing, but it ain' t.
I could run it.
Your father signed every paper she set in front of him.
Never lifted a hand to save himself.
Well....
I' m sorry to have no better news...... but some things in this world can' t be helped.
I believe this is probably one of them.
She went back to San Antonio.
Don' t call her "she."
Mama.
I thought the world of that old man.
Don' t go crying on me now.
I ain' t.
- I ain' t.
- What do you think I should do?
- I don' t think there' s much to do.
- I can' t.
You could talk to her.
Last conversation I had with her...... was in San Diego, California, in 1 942.
It ain' t her fault.
I ain' t the same as I once was.
Like to think I am...... but I ain' t.
You are inside.
Inside you are.
It' s hard to watch people you came from waste away before your eyes.
When the land is gone too...... there' s nothing to stand on or stand for either.
When do y' all have to be out?
Closing is the first of June.
You could wait till then.
What for?
Down in Mexico...... they got ranches so big...... you can' t ride from one end to the other in a week.
Not down there.
You think they can' t use two more top hands?
Real cowboys, huh?
Just like the old- time waddies.
If I don' t go, will you go anyways?
I' m already gone.
- Thank you for everything.
- Goodbye.
May God go with you.
Be careful.
Is that you, bud?
I hope so.
- Yeah.
- They suspect anything?
Got to pile all this stuff.
- Yonder goes the light.
- Late for your own funeral.
- He could be getting milk.
He could just be loading a shotgun.
Shut up.
Lacey, there' s been somebody following us.
- Somebody on horseback?
- Yeah.
Some kid.
That' s a hell of a horse.
Ain' t it, though?
- I ain' t hunting you.
- Why you following us?
I' m going to Langtry.
I don' t even know you.
- Where' d you get that horse?
- Sixteen.
- You don' t know.
I know you ain' t no goddamn 1 6.
- What if I did?
We could sell his horse in Mexico.
- You want to?
Your idea.
I was the one that said just leave him for the buzzards.
Heads.
Damn.
Let me have your rifle.
You shot the last three.
You go on, then.
You can owe me.
It might not be gun- broke.
Y' all ain' t never shot nobody.
You could be a good somebody to start with.
I knowed it all along.
Who' s hunting you?
Nobody.
They' re hunting that horse, though, right?
You ain' t riding with us.
Get us in the jailhouse.
He belongs to me.
But he damn sure don' t belong to you.
Now, let' s go, bud.
I thought he' d put up more of a argument.
We ain' t seen the last of his skinny ass.
That' s her, ain' t it?
That' s the goddamn Rio Grande.
Over yonder' s Old Mexico.
You reckon you want to cross now?
You?
Yeah.
All right.
Shit.
I got a uneasy feeling about that son of a bitch.
I do too.
He ain' t as green as he looks, neither.
There won' t nobody be hunting me in Mexico.
That all depends on what you done.
- What' s your name?
- Jimmy Blevins.
No.
No.
You' re just a deadhead.
Just tell me one thing.
What the hell would we want you with us for?
Because I' m a American.
When did you eat last?
Other day.
Your name ain' t Blivit, is it?
It' s Blevins.
What?
Ten pounds of shit in a five- pound sack.
Y' all ain' t said y' all' s names was.
I' m John Grady Cole.
This here' s Lacey Rawlins.
We' re from San Angelo.
Where you from?
Near the Sabinal River.
What made you light out for Mexico?
Same reason as you.
What reason is that?
Because they' d go bowlegged and blind finding your ass down here.
Nobody' s hunting me.
I told that son of a bitch he wasn' t whupping me again.
- Your daddy?
He never came back from the war.
Your stepdaddy.
I know what it' s like to get a beating.
I would' ve.
And he knowed it too.
Suppose we trade that horse off for one less likely get us shot.
- I ain' t trading horses.
- We ain' t no wet nurses.
- I can take care of myself.
Hell, you' re a regular old desperado, ain' t you?
Yeah, I got a gun.
What kind of a gun?
- 32- 20 Colt.
- Bullshit.
That' s a rifle cartridge.
Let' s see it.
Where' d you get a gun like this?
At the getting place.
- You ever shot it?
- Yeah, I shot it.
- Anything you want.
Bullshit.
All right, let' s go, outlaw.
You ready, Annie Oakley?
Waiting on you.
- Let me see it.
- We' d better get going.
- Come on, give it to me.
- You know what my wallet looks like.
Look at this shit.
She got anything to drink?
What is that?
- All right.
Let' s have three of them.
How much is it?
It' s like three cents.
Oh, let your old dad buy it.
He about dead- centred your pocketbook, didn' t he?
I want you to look at my goddamn driver' s license.
And my pool hall card.
You won' t need them down here.
Shot Betty Ward between the eyes.
What' s she doing in there?
I didn' t know you liked her.
Cactus juice?
I don' t know.
- Got a little kick to it, though.
- I think it does.
Pretty doggone good.
Say my name again.
It' s not much.
You can' t have no more cider.
I' m drunker than shit.
Can you ride or not?
Hell, yeah, I can ride.
I was riding when I fell off.
I' m a regular buckaroo.
Certified damn bronc peeler.
Get on and quit assing around.
Come on.
I can' t be out in this.
- Where do you think you' il go?
On account of the lightning.
Damn if you don' t look sober all of a sudden.
- Are you afraid of lightning?
- It runs in the family.
It run all the way down the hole to get him, 1 80 feet.
A great- uncle on my mother' s side...... was killed off a horse.
Horse' s hair wasn' t singed, but it killed him.
He was struck by lightning coming back from his barn.
Melted the fillings in his teeth and soldered his jaw shut.
He' s gone completely dipshit.
I done been struck twice myself.
How come me be deaf in this one ear?
I' m born to death by fire, man.
You don' t know what it' d get you.
Your boot spurs, shirt buttons....
What do you intend to do?
Outride it.
What the hell is wrong with you?
It' s the only chance I got.
I knowed it from the first time that son of a bitch had a loose nut.
What the hell are you doing?!
Just sitting here.
If this rain hits hard, there' il be a river come down like a train.
You thought about that?
You don' t know what it' s like.
You' il drown sitting there.
I ain' t never been drowned before.
Well...... l' il say no more.
Your horse is gone.
I done been on foot looking around this morning.
Where' d you find that boot?
On the ground.
Well, what do you aim to do?
I don' t know.
Let' s get your ass up out of there.
Got a spare shirt in my saddlebag.
Appreciate it.
I don' t give a shit.
- Shit.
- Hold on.
Keep riding.
Good God almighty.
- Listen at that.
Get us all shot for horse- stealing don' t mean a thing.
It' s mine.
- Shit- for- brains!
Both of you.
Get over here and sit down.
We' re going to stick here...... till about a hour before daylight.
Now, you got to play this exactly like we say.
Okay.
All right.
You go on and get some sleep.
And no fire tonight.
Every dumb thing I ever done in my life...... there was a decision I made before that got me into it.
It was always some choice I' d made before.
Yeah, I think so.
Meaning what?
Won' t be no other time, I guarantee it.
- Yes, sir.
What if it was you?
I wouldn' t leave you, or you me.
You realize the fix he' s in?
It' s the fix he' s put himself in.
I can' t do it.
Well, if you can' t, you can' t.
I guess I knew what you' d say anyways.
Damn it.
That little son of a bitch.
Hold up, hold up.
Let' s listen.
You little son of a bitch.
- Boys, they' re coming.
- Cars or horses?
Horses.
And there ain' t no way y' all can keep up.
I' il take the road.
They' il follow the dust, since they' re hunting me.
Get in the woods.
I' il see y' all down the road.
Let' s get off this damn road.
You think they caught him?
I don' t know.
I' il say one thing for him anyways.
What' s that?
Son of a bitch wouldn' t stand still for nobody hijacking his horse.
- All right.
You reckon they' re friendly?
Shoot, I hope so.
Where are you going?
We' re just passing through.
We' re looking for work.
We might have some work for you.
He said maybe.
Yes, of course.
Good.
Over there?
Did you see that little darling?
Watch it.
Bring him over here.
Get in there.
How long you reckon you' d like to stay here?
About a hundred years.
Now go to sleep.
There' s Don Hector Rocha y Villareal.
One of the last great ranches in Mexico.
Flies his own plane to Mexico City every week.
Manuel said this ranch been in this family 1 70 years.
You reckon that was his daughter?
Yeah, I guess it was.
Let me go get my boots on.
Looks like there' s about 1 2 or 1 3 of them.
I make it 1 6.
Damn.
You think you and me can break all 1 6 of them in four days?
- Why four days?
- You think we could do it?
You' d be about a wore- out sumbuck, I' il tell you that.
Go talk to Armando.
I' m all right.
If we mess this up, bud, it' s gonna be a long ride back to Texas.
Give it some slack.
That' s it.
Whoa, boy.
I' il put a saddle on you right now.
Your jackets.
You tired?
The horse is arriving, get ready.
Don' t delay!
Hector de la Rocha y Villareal.
John Grady Cole.
Glad to meet you.
Alfonsa, you look like an lmpressionist painting.
Armando says you know a lot about horses.
I' ve been around them some.
Do you know what a criollo is?
It' s a Argentine horse.
Yes, sir.
San Angelo.
Why are you here?
I just wanted to see the country, I reckon.
- Yes, sir.
But you are the leader.
We don' t have no leaders.
No, we' re just buddies.
Of course.
I recently purchased a thoroughbred stallion of excellent blood.
- You gonna raise racehorses?
Quarter horses.
I' m thinking of breeding my stallion with my mesteno mares.
What' s your opinion on that?
There' s been good cow horses sired out of thoroughbreds.
Of what importance is the mare?
In my opinion.
Most breeders place more confidence in the stallion.
Yes, sir, they do.
But I agree with you.
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Just me and him.
Yes, sir.
- It ain' t like you was going away.
We' d still be working together.
It' s a good opportunity for you.
Hell, I' d do it.
They told me to come bunk in here.
I was going to put my horse in one of these stalls.
Can I put my horse in this stall?
Well, I guess we can talk later.
That' s your mare.
Look at the eye on her.
Bring this one here.
She' s not as big as the other one, but that' s your mare.
Do you like this one?
She' s a beauty.
Looks like some of them got their hats on, bud.
I figure you just must be ready to cry yourself to sleep every night.
She' s probably used to dating guys got their own airplanes, let alone cars.
You' re probably right.
I' m glad to hear you say it.
It don' t change nothing though.
My name' s John Grady Cole.
My name is Alejandra.
I know.
I hoped that you would come.
I come because I thought you' d be here.
I know.
Seventy- four years.
Seem there could hardly be one without the other.
I guess...... the country lasts forever, and people ain' t but for a while.
And how will you live now?
Where will your home be?
What' s wrong?
I dreamed about you last night.
What did you dream about?
Someday I may tell you.
But not tonight.
Do I have something in my nose?
I have something in my nose.
Do you like him?
A hell of a horse.
What?
When?
Now.
- I want to now.
- He don' t have a saddle.
I know.
I don' t think the patrón would want me to give him to you without a saddle.
Your father.
Get down.
- Yes!
Hurry.
Well, what do you aim to do with your horse?
I want you to take him back to the barn.
Somebody' s gonna see me.
Fixing to get me in trouble.
You are in trouble.
I am Senorita Alfonsa.
I' m John Grady Cole.
I' m happy that you have come.
Alejandra will be in Mexico City with her mother for two weeks.
Then she' il be here for the summer.
Alejandra and I disagree strongly.
In fact, I....
I seem, at times, to be struggling with my own past self.
So you see, I cannot help but be sympathetic to Alejandra.
But I won' t have her unhappy.
I won' t have her spoken ill of...... or gossiped about.
I know what that is.
It is not proper for you to be seen riding in campo together...... without supervision.
I' ve decided not.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to be considerate of a young girl' s reputation.
I never meant not to be.
I believe you.
But you see...... this is another country.
Here, a woman' s reputation is all she has.
There' s no forgiveness...... for women.
A man may lose his honour and regain it again, but a woman cannot.
I guess I' d have to say that don' t seem right.
It' s not a matter of right.
It' s a matter of who must say.
And in this matter, I get to say.
What is it?
You' re going to wake Esteban.
Then invite me in.
What did she say to you?
My aunt?
You want to sit down?
Go on.
What did she say to you?
- Of course she did.
What did she say?
She said she didn' t want me being seen with you in the campo.
And you agreed?
- No.
Just like everyone else.
It ain' t like that.
I hate the way she treats me.
I thought you were my friend.
You tell me what you want me to do.
I' il do anything you say.
How' s it going, Esteban?
See you after a while.
I know the old man likes you...... that don' t mean he' il sit for you courting his daughter.
Yeah, I know.
Well, I don' t see you holding no aces, bud.
I see you fixing to get us fired and throwed off this place.
Take it easy, bud.
Get up!
What' s this all about?
No talking!
Yes, but I don' t understand --
You understand "shut up"?
Let' s go.
I ain' t above whipping your ass, you know.
Don' t you think if we' re gonna get out of this...... we might think about how to get out of it together?
Like the way we got in it?
You think it was Rocha?
You think he sold us down the river?
Tried many times.
I know.
Some things ain' t reasonable.
Look, I' m the same man you crossed that river with.
How I was is how I am.
And all I know to do is stick.
I don' t believe in signing on just till it quit suiting you.
You either stick or you quit.
I don' t care what you done.
That' s about all I got to say.
All right.
Oh, God help me.
How long you been in here?
I don' t know.
A long time.
- At least a month.
I wouldn' t do nothing like it.
Bullshit.
They wouldn' t hunt us if they got that horse back.
My gun too.
- What did you do?
- Nothing nobody else wouldn' t.
Did you come back here?
You' re damn right I did.
What did you do?
What are they accusing him of?
Murder.
He killed a man?
Three.
Said he killed three men.
That' s a damn lie.
Don' t step in the bucket.
We' re dead men.
I knew it' d come to this from the first moment --
That won' t help.
- Ain' t but one of them died.
Tell me what happened.
Saved me up some money.
Then I rode back here to get my pistol.
I seen it sticking in the son of a bitch' s belt, so I just grabbed it.
He come at me.
What choice --?
By the time I got back to the spring where my horse was...... they caught back up with me.
And the old boy, I shot off his horse.
He throwed down on me with a shotgun.
Did you shoot a rurales?
- Yeah.
- Dead?
Yeah.
What do you think they mean to do?
- Send me to the penitentiary.
- You ain' t gonna be that lucky.
They' il lie about your age.
There' s no capital punishment here.
- You knew they' d hunt us.
- Was I supposed to send a telegram?
- What happened to your feet?
- They busted them.
No.
It won' t matter.
What did you say?
You will too.
Your friend told us everything.
Better that you do the same to avoid some trouble.
You had no right to beat up on that boy.
We know nothing about Blevins.
We know nothing about the horse.
It got away from him in the storm and showed up here.
That' s when the trouble started.
We been working for Senor Rocha going on three months down at La Purisima.
You went down there and told him lies.
Rawlins is as good a boy as ever come out of Tom Green County.
Is that the criminal, Smith?
I grew up with him.
The assassin Blevins, he did not have any documents.
- He lost his clothes?
- He what?
- He has no feathers.
I wouldn' t know anything about that.
That don' t interest me.
Why does he come here and steal horses?
- It was his horse.
- No, it' s not.
You have it your own ignorant way.
As far as I know, that horse is his.
He had it in Texas and I saw him bring it to Mexico across a river.
That is not the facts.
Or we can lose it here.
But in three days, you' re going to be going to Saltillo.
Too late.
Because you' il be in the hands of other peoples...... and who' s to say what the truth will be then?
And then you' il think about this day...... and you' il blame yourself.
There ain' t but one truth.
Truth is not what come out of somebody' s mouth.
The people in this town are very quiet people.
Very quiet people all the time.
And then comes this assassin Blevins...... and he kills everybody and steals their horses.
Why does he do this?
Was he a good, quiet boy that never did no harm?
Then he comes here and does something like that? ls that what happened?
No, that' s not what happened.
That' s not the truth.
Truth is he was always the other kind of boy.
He was always the other kind.
Nothing.
I think we' re going to Saltillo.
What' s in Saltillo?
The penitentiary.
I think he wants to make a deal with us.
What kind of a deal?
To keep quiet.
That kind of a deal.
Keep quiet about what?
About Blevins.
About what about Blevins?
I think they aim to kill him.
I think they aim to kill Blevins.
Boys...... this is going to be a long trip.
He said it was going to take all day.
What' s here?
Unload the prisoners, boys.
- Take a leak, I reckon.
Unload the prisoners.
Put them against the wall.
Let' s go.
What are they going to do?
Wait a minute!
Let go of me.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
This man came to me.
I don' t go to this man.
He came to me to talk with me about justice...... and how his own brother had died at the hands of the assassin Blevins.
Then when it came time to do justice...... he could not shoot.
He was like a woman.
A man cannot go out to do something...... and then not do it.
No, a man does not change his mind.
That' s always been my way in this world.
You didn' t have to kill him.
Could' ve just walked him back to the truck.
You don' t know nothing.
See, in my country, we don' t have death for criminals.
Monies have to be paid...... and arrangements have to be made.
I tell you this because...... you' il have to make arrangements with these peoples.
We don' t have no money.
Everybody does what he says.
We ain' t fixing to make any arrangements.
Oh, excuse me, but you will.
I' m telling you this because I like you.
You cannot stay here.
You stay here, you' re gonna die.
And then comes other problems.
The paperwork is lost.
People cannot be found.
Who' s to say you were even here?
Some crazy people can say that God is here.
But God is not here.
Everybody knows that God is not here.
I never dreamed there was such a place as this.
There' s probably every kind of place you can think of.
They' re gonna kill us.
Don' t let them think they ain' t gonna have to.
They either kill us or let us be.
Don' t act scared.
Where are you going?
I don' t know, bud.
Got a match?
What is it?
A knife.
A good one.
What' s it like to be dead?
It ain' t like nothing at all.
What' s it like to be dead?
It ain' t like nothing at all.
Fast.
You been doing any doctoring on a boy named Lacey Rawlins?
Send you some soap, some towels...... so you can wash up.
You don' t know a Lacey Rawlins?
You are fortunate boys.
Fortunate boys.
Where' s Rawlins?
He wait outside for you.
Right now?
Yes, now.
Where are we going?
You' re going to your house.
Now?
Now.
I thought you' d died.
I thought you had.
Why ain' t we dead?
She paid us out.
The aunt.
Why?
I don' t know.
It' s got to do with that girl.
I expect it does.
You going back down there?
Yeah, I guess I am.
On account of the girl.
But what about the horses?
The girl and the horses.
What about Rocha?
He' il have to do whatever he has to do.
Don' t go down there.
- I know.
They put Mexican blood in me in that hospital.
So?
About what?
Well, does that mean I' m part Mexican?
How much they put in you?
They said it was over a litre.
A liter would make you a half- breed.
- It don' t, does it?
No, it don' t mean nothing.
It don' t know where it come from.
You heard about what happened, didn' t you?
Yeah.
I never thought I' d do that.
You didn' t have no choice.
He' d have done it to you.
You don' t got to try to make it right.
It is what it is.
Nothing.
What is it?
I keep thinking about old Blevins.
About how scared he was.
You' il feel better when you get home.
I don' t think so.
I know you ain' t.
I was wondering how much better off you are than him.
I reckon I' il see you one of these days.
You take care.
You take care too.
I think I' m owed an explanation.
I think the accounts have been settled quite in your favour.
You have been a disappointment to my nephew...... and a considerable expense to me.
No offense, ma' am, but I' ve been some inconvenienced myself.
Sit down, please.
The officers were here once before, you know.
My nephew sent them away until he conducted his own investigation.
He wanted so much to go on believing in you.
- Why didn' t he say something to me?
- He gave his word to the commandante.
He should' ve let me tell my side of it.
You had already lied to him once.
I never lied to him.
The affair of the stolen horse was known here even before you arrived.
The thieves were Americans.
When he questioned you about this, you denied everything.
Why' d you buy me out of jail?
I think you know why.
Yes.
What did she give in return?
I think you know that also.
Yes.
You didn' t have the right.
You should' ve left me there.
- Then I' d have died.
We' re willing that you should have a horse.
I' il trust Esteban to supervise the selection.
Do you have enough money?
Do you have enough money?
I aim to see her.
Am I supposed to be surprised?
I' il even give you my permission.
Although that doesn' t seem to be a thing you have ever required.
Her telephone number.
In the end, Mr. Cole...... we all get cured of our sentiments.
Those whom life doesn' t cure...... death will.
She will not break her word to me.
You will see.
We will.
I knew it would be you.
I have to see you.
I can' t.
You have to.
I' m coming.
No, you can' t.
I go to La Purisima in two days.
- I' il meet you at the train.
- No, my father will have men there.
Alejandra, I love you.
I love you.
You didn' t have no right to make that promise, even if they killed me.
I ain' t gonna leave until I see you.
Even if it' s the last time, I don' t care.
Even if they kill me now.
Tomorrow morning.
I' il say that my aunt is ill.
Meet me in Zacatecas.
I will be there.
My God, you' re beautiful.
- It' s all my fault.
You couldn' t have saved us.
You couldn' t have saved Blevins.
I told my father we were lovers.
Why?
She said I must stop seeing you or she' d tell him.
I couldn' t stand for her to have that power.
She left me no choice.
I told him myself.
I love you so much, I thought I could make him understand.
It was her arrogance.
She made me crazy.
But I broke my father' s heart.
I broke his heart.
I put you in danger, and you almost died.
He had Armando lock me into my room so that I couldn' t warn you.
The next morning, he flew me back to the city.
I thought I would never, never see you again.
Don' t cry.
Don' t cry.
Don' t cry.
I destroyed everything.
I' m going to make it right.
You can' t.
Somehow, I will.
You don' t understand.
What don' t I understand?
I didn' t know that my father could stop loving me.
Now I know.
What are you doing?
I saw you dead in a dream.
Just like the dream I had the night before we danced together.
It was dawn.
Men in serapes stood over you.
And you were dying.
All because of your whore.
Don' t say that.
I want you to marry me and come to Texas.
When I found out you were in prison I made a promise.
Yes.
I love you.
I' il love you till the day I die.
I believe you.
I swear to God.
I believe you.
I cannot do what you ask.
But I cannot.
I have no honour except my promise.
If I lose that too...... then what am l?
Shut the door.
What do you want?
I come for my horse.
- I don' t have your horses.
You by God know where they' re at.
You make trouble for yourself.
I got trouble you never even heard of.
Are you still here, old man?
Yes, yes of course.
You' re free to go.
You' re free to go.
Go with God.
You son of the unlucky...
Go with God, my friend.
Go inside.
Come here.
Hey, who' s there?
Raul, the Captain.
I want to see a horse.
I want to see a horse.
What horse?
American.
The American horse.
What' s going on?
Nothing.
The gringo has taken me prisoner!
Don' t shoot!
If you follow us, I' il kill them.
Stop!
If you come back, I' il kill the Captain.
You' re going to die.
When I die, you die.
- Because you' re my hostage.
I' il shoot you.
Have to come back to my town?
For my horse.
My head is sick.
I can' t ride no more.
You' d be surprised at what you can do.
You' re going to die.
We' il let God decide about that.
I' m not afraid of God.
I got no reason to be afraid.
I even got a bone or two to pick with Him.
Where are the keys?
Where are the keys!
Goddamn you!
Die, you son of a bitch!
Give me your goddamn hand.
I' m not going to kill you.
I' m not like you.
Go on.
You' re free to go.
Far as you can...... tote that saddle.
Hey, give me the keys.
Go over to the Captain.
Don' t let him get up.
The keys.
Beans...... and a rabbit.
How is your wound?
You doing okay?
Pants...... a serape.
Go with God, my son.
How you doing?
Could you tell me what day it is?
It' s Thursday.
I mean the date.
It' s Thanksgiving.
Do either of you want to buy a rifle?
I' m not interested.
So I come back across and was riding on the road...... and I run into this man, and he told me I had to come see a judge.
There' s a problem with the horses.
Your Honour...... the fact of the matter is this boy ain' t got a lick of proof.
Three different horses and different brands on them.
Deputy Smith, you know what the trouble with a liar is?
Trouble with a liar is, he can' t remember what he said.
I know that' s right.
I ain' t a liar.
I know that.
I can' t believe anybody would make up a story like the one you just told.
Yes, sir.
You mind showing the court them bullet holes in your leg?
That' s where it come out.
Thank you.
- You didn' t have no medical attention?
Wasn' t none to be had.
Deputy Smith?
Your Honour?
I want you to see that this boy gets his horses back.
Son, you' re free to go.
Thank you.
The court thanks you for your testimony.
In all the years I' ve sat on this bench...... l heard lots of things that give me grave doubts about the human race.
This ain' t one of them.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I don' t like to bother you.
But they told me this is where you live.
That' s all right.
Come on in.
- Thank you.
- Pleased to have you.
When I was in the penitentiary...... l killed somebody.
I' m sorry to hear that.
He come at me with a knife.
I just happened to get the best of him.
But that keeps bothering me somehow.
Yes, sir.
That Mexican captain.
Why do you suppose that is?
Because I sat there, and he walked the boy out to the trees and shot him.
I didn' t say nothing.
I didn' t say a word.
Would it have done any good?
That don' t make it right.
And it never will.
Bothered me that you might think that I' m something special.
I ain' t.
You know what you strike me as?
One of them people that has a tendency...... to be a little tough on themselves.
You' il get it sorted out.
I hope so.
If I live.
You' il live, all right.
Lacey once asked me if I thought God looks out for people.
I guess He does.
I say He' s just about got to.
I don' t believe we' d make it a day otherwise.
I thought you might want your old horse back.
Damn, bud.

Now, children, are you sitting comfortably?
Then I' il begin
But it was all over in just seven days
All that long, long time ago none of the things we can see now the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, the animals, and plants not a single one existed, only God existed and so only He could have created them, and He did
I wonder whatever became of old...
I imagine he' s dead like all the rest
Those were the days
Mr. Tuttle, your hair!
- Good morning, ma' am, we' ve come about..
Oh, yes, of course!
Come in!
I wasn' t expecting you so soon
- I' m Bertha Mills, ma' am
- and this is Edmund Tuttle - Pleased to meet you, ma' am
- You must be the gardener - That' s right, the gardener
- And this young lady is called Lydia - Have you had much experience in service?
Oh, don' t let that angel face fool you, ma' am, she' s older than she looks
Can you iron?
What' s the matter?
Has the cat caught your tongue?
She can' t talk, ma' am the poor little mite is a mute
But she' s a good little worker I can promise you that
Alright, alright, the other girl I had spoke too much anyway
Follow me, Mrs. Mills, you and the girl you will sleep in the attic room on top of the stairs
- Tuttle, ma' am
Tuttle, you could sleep in the shed around the back
As you can see, the housework has been rather neglected since the servants disappeared almost a week ago
- You mean they just vanished?
- Into thin air
They didn' t even collect their wages
- They... they just left us - What a strange thing to do
You' il soon find out there are times when this house isn' t exactly an ideal home
Hence my advertisement in the newspaper requesting honest, hardworking people
- Isn' t that right, Mr. Tuttle?
- Oh, aye, we' re very honest and... very hardworking
The kitchen, I have breakfast at eight, the children at nine
Lunch will be served at one and dinner at half past seven
And the master, ma' am?
The master went off to war a year and a half ago
I' ve had no news since the war ended
- Which of you does the cooking?
- I' m so sorry, ma' am
Which of you does the cooking?
You' il notice what I' m doing
In this house, no door must be opened without the previous one being closed first
It is vital that you remember this
It' s not as easy as it may seem
There are fifteen different keys for all of the fifty doors depending on which area of the house you' re in at the time
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow onwards I will be leaving a set of keys in your charge
Yes, ma' am
Music room, that old piano was already here when we moved in
Please do not let the children thumb away on it, it sets off my migraine
Silence is something that we prize very highly in this house
That is why you will not find a telephone, a radio, or anything else that makes a racket
Oh, we don' t have electricity either
During the war, the Germans kept cutting it off, so we just learned to live without it
Let' s continue
Ma' am, there' s really no need to show us around the whole house, we...
Because here, most of the time, you can hardly see your way
It' s often difficult to make out if there is a table, a chair a door, a sideboard or one of my children playing hide- and- seek
What do you mean, ma' am?
Perhaps I should introduce you to the children
Mr. Tuttle, you can see to the garden now
- You' il find tools in the shed - Yes, ma' am
You two could start closing the curtains
All of them
Come
I' il wake them, you wait here
Whatever you do don' t open the curtains
Wakey- wakey...
Now, come on, eyes closed hands together
Blessed be, at light of day Jesus to whom now I pray
Blessed be the Virgin pure whom I greet with faith so sure
Jesus, Mary spotless rose, keep us till this day doth close
- They' re still half asleep - What sweet little children
Well, what do you say?
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
How do you do, children?
My name is Mrs. Mills but you can call me Bertha, if you like
What are your names?
- Anne - Nicholas
- Anne and Nicholas, what pretty names - Are you going to be our new nanny?
Yes, my dears I' m your new nanny
It' s time for their breakfast
Lydia, go to the kitchen and close every shutter
- The doctors were never able to find a cure - For what?
Their condition...
Children have a very serious allergy to light
They' re photosensitive and must never be exposed to any light much stronger than this
Otherwise, in a matter of minutes they will break out in sores and blisters and begin to suffocate it would eventually be fatal
Good heavens!
Why not?
It tastes funny I liked it better before
That was because, before, somebody else made it
- When are they coming back?
- They' re not coming back, child
- Just like daddy - Daddy is coming back, though
- It' s the world war!
- I know, but he' s in France
That' s enough chatterboxes finish up your breakfasts
- Are you going to leave us too?
- Of course not!
- Why should I leave you?
But they did and then it happened
- Be quiet!
- What do you mean, Anne, what happened?
- Mommy went... mad - Nothing happened!
- No, it didn' t!
- Yes, it did!
- Be quiet!
What' s going on?
I want to see those plates empty in less than a minute, is that clear?
Mrs. Mills, would you come outside a moment?
I' d like a word with you
The postman usually comes every Wednesday
But I just checked the letter box and this week he hasn' t
I' m afraid I don' t follow, ma' am
It' s an advertisement for servants
Since it was never published, would you mind explaining to me what you' re doing here
Now I understand
Well, ma' am, that' s exactly what I was going to say to you when you opened the door to us
The truth is that we just come by on the off- chance
You know, a big house like this is always in need of someone who knows the ropes
You mean you' ve served in a house like this one before?
This may come as a surprise to you, ma' am, but, we in fact used to work here
- Oh no, it was a few years ago
If you don' t mind my saying so, ma' am they were the best years of my life
That' s why we come by, because this house means a lot to us
Perhaps I' d best show you our references, ma' am
No, no, no, don' t bother there' s no need, ah so you say you know the house well?
Like the back of my hand
Well that is always assuming that the walls haven' t sprouted legs and moved in the meantime
The only thing that moves here is the light
But it changes everything
It' s rather difficult, to say the least
One might almost say unbearable
The only way of enduring it is by keeping a cool head
I don' t like fantasies, strange ideas, do you know what I mean?
I think so, ma' am
My children sometimes have strange ideas
But you mustn' t pay any attention to them
- Children will be children - Yes, of course, ma' am
Alright, you can stay
Thank you very much, ma' am
It did happened
"To make them change their minds" full stop...
Afterwards....
He ordered them to be beaten, but Justus and Pastor, far from being afraid rejoiced and showed themselves willing to die for Christ
When he saw this, the Roman governor was filled of rage and ordered their heads to be cut off
What do you find so amusing?
- Well - Well what?
- Those children were really stupid - Why?
Because they said they only believed in Jesus and then they got killed for it
And what would you have done?
Deny Christ?
Well, yes, inside I would' ve believed in him but I wouldn' t have told the Romans that
Is that what you think too, Nicholas?
So you both would have lied to the point of denying Christ
Oh, you would' ve saved your heads being chopped off by the Romans, that' s true
- But what would' ve happened afterwards?
- When?
The one that' s waiting for us after we die, where would you have gone?
- Oh - Oh
- Where, Nicholas?
- To the children' s Limbo
What is the children' s Limbo, Anne?
- One of the four hells!
- Which are?
Me!
- No, no, no, let him answer, which are?
There' s the hell where the damned go then there' s purgatory and the Bosom of Abraham, where the Just go and Limbo where children go
At the center of the Earth where it' s very, very hot
Oh no!
No!
They' re damned forever!
Think about it!
Try to imagine the end of eternity
Close your eyes, close your eyes and try to imagine it, forever
- Pain, forever - I' m getting dizzy
Now do you understand why Justus and Pastor told the truth?
- Can we go and play?
- You most certainly cannot
First you' re going to read the lesson, then you' re going to learn it by heart
Anne, any more protests and there will be no playing for you at all today
- No!
Yes!
Yes!
You get scared?
As if you weren' t used to this house by now
What if we see a ghost?
I haven' t told him anything!
Well if you see a ghost, you say "hello" and you continue on studying
Anne, come with me to the music room
Why me?
Because I say so!
Now come on! take your book
Nicholas, I want to see that lesson learned in less than an hour
- What?
- Give me a kiss - Give me a kiss!
Give me a kiss!
- Anne, wait for me outside - You know I can' t
Over there
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains my daughter is going to cross the living room
Alright, Anne
Darling, mommy can' t be with you all the time
You must learn to be on your own, where' s your rosary?
I want you to squeeze it with all your might and say "Our Father"
- And then your fear will go away - It won' t
Yes!
Yes, it will, honestly
Don' t you see that when you do that the Lord is with you?
There' s no reason to be afraid
The house and the family
We all live in a house with our family
The family is usually made up of parents, children, and their grandparents
We must be obedient and kind...... and kind towards other members of our family and we must never argue or fight with our brothers and sisters
- Do you have any children?
- No
Mr. Tuttle and the girl, Lydia, are all I' ve got and I' m all they' ve got
- Was she born like that?
- Beg your pardon, ma' am?
- The girl, was she born a mute?
You know, I think I finished here, ma' am
If you' il excuse me, I think I' il go and see if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand
I' m coming!
- What' s the matter?
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn' t crying, I was reading
But I just heard you...
- I haven' t learned it yet, mommy - Are you all right?
Yes
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn' t crying
But I just heard you a moment ago there' s no need to feel ashamed, darling
I don' t!
- Oh, really?
So I imagined it, did I?
- No, it was that boy
- What boy?
- Who' s Victor?
- The boy who was here a moment ago
I told him to let me study but he wouldn' t stop crying
I think he' s a spoiled brat!
Did he now?
Why was he crying?
- His father is a pianist...
- Oh!
His father is a pianist, is he?
Yes, and I' ve already told him that he' s not allowed to touch the piano
- So you' ve spoken to his father as well?
- No, only with Victor
His father is with the others in the hall
But I' ve just come from the hall there' s no one there
They must have gone upstairs they' re viewing the house
That' il do, Anne!
That' s enough!
- It was Victor
- So where is he now?
- He went down through there!
Would you mind telling me, how a boy can get in and out of this room if it' s locked?
I thought I made myself quite clear
No door is to be opened without the previous one being closed first
Is that so hard to understand?
This house is like a ship, the light must be contained as if it were water by opening and closing the doors!
- But ma' am, I...
Do not argue with me!
Be quiet!
Now, which was the last of you to enter that room?
She hasn' t got a key I already told you that
- That leaves you then - But I was in the hall the whole time and then I went out into the garden you saw me with your own eyes
I hope you are not suggesting that it was me!
Do you think that I would overlook such a thing and endanger the life of my own daughter?
We' re not supposed to read at the table
Oh, really?
And who' s going to tell mommy?
Or perhaps you!
- Did you really see a boy?
- Yes, he' s called Victor
- Don' t be stupid
- Ghosts aren' t like that - What are they like?
I' ve told you a thousand times they go about in white sheets and carry chains
How do you know?
Because I' ve seen them, they come out at night
Fibber!
Where?
- You' re stupid - Not half as much as you
But I don' t believe you saw that boy
Believe what you like, you' il soon be begging us to play with you
- Nicholas, Nicholas - What?
- Look - Why have you opened the curtains?
- Who was it then?
It was Victor he' s been doing it all night
- You' re a liar, I' m going to tell mommy - So I' m a liar, am I?
Yes
Victor, come out from behind that curtain so my stupid brother can see you!
- Leave me alone!
- So you don' t want to see him now, eh?
You' re a cowardly custard... cowardly, cowardly custard, cowardly cowardly custard
Well, I' il just have to do it myself, then
That' s enough, Victor!
Nicholas, Nicholas, tell him to leave the curtains alone, he won' t listen to me
- Stop it!
Get off my bed, both of you - This is our bed!
No, it' s mine!
Anne, please stop putting on that voice
You be quiet, cowardly custard
Listen, if you don' t stop I' il call my mother and she' il kick you out
- You don' t know my mother - And you don' t know my parents!
Anne, I' m going to tell mommy about you!
Can' t you see it' s not me?
Victor, touch his cheek so he knows you' re real
Help!
Mommy!
What is it?
She was frightening me and I told her to be quiet
I' m fed up, do you hear me?
I am fed up with you!
I didn' t do anything
Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken
So he drove out the man, and placed at the east of the Garden of Eden Cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life
- There, I' ve finished!
- Very good
- What?!
That' s not what we agreed - We didn' t agree anything, young lady
Today, you' re being punished and you' il do as I say
How dare you?
Mommy, I won' t ask forgiveness for something I didn' t do!
- There was!
- You' re lying!
I am not!
Anne, do you remember the story about Justus and Pastor?
Children who don' t tell the truth end up in Limbo
But I read the other day that Limbo is only for children who haven' t been baptized
And I have!
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac, his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together
Isaac spoke unto Abraham, his father and said: my father and he said: here I am, my son and he...
- Did you look in on Nicholas?
The little angel is fast asleep
What about Anne?
Is she still on the stairs?
I prefer to have her where I can see her but I can' t embroider in such poor light
How long is this punishment going to go on, it' s been three days now
It' s up to her
She' s got to learn to swallow her pride and ask for forgiveness
Anyway, it' s about time she started to read the Bible
Well, the priest will be very pleased to hear that, ma' am
If he ever deigns to pay us another visit
He knows perfectly well that the children can' t go out
He told me yesterday he' il be by as soon as possible
I' m beginning to feel totally cut off from the world
This fog doesn' t exactly help it' s never lasted this long before
- That' s true, ma' am - Even the sea gulls have gone quiet
Anne, I can' t hear you
She' s, he' s been hurdling backwards and forth as if there were three of her
Would you kindly tell her it' s not necessary to kick up quite such a rumpus just to do a little cleaning
I couldn' t bear to get another migraine attack
- I' il tell her, ma' am - Thank you
Now she' s really gone too far, Lydia!
- Nothing, mommy
I' m just reading like you told me
- Did you hear it as well?
- Hear what?
And the Angel of the Lord called on to Abraham out of heaven a second time and said: by myself, I have sworn, saith the Lord...
Shhh!
- Who was that?
- I don' t know
Anne, tell me who' s making that noise
- I can' t tell you, mommy - You tell me
I told you there was someone in the room and you punished me!
- Now, I don' t know what to say - Anne, I want the truth
Tell me if there is someone upstairs
There, in that junk room
Mommy, you' re letting the light in!
- They just came past here
- Didn' t you see them?
- Which way did they go?
Over there, over there oh, and down there as well
They' re everywhere they say this house is theirs and they said they' re going to take the curtains down as well
- Ma' am, stay calm, please - I will not stay calm!
For five full years during the occupation
I' ve managed to avoid a single Nazi ever stepping foot in this house and now there is someone here under my nose, opening and closing the doors!
Ma' am, this is a very old house, the floorboards squeak and the plumbing clanks
There were voices, I' m telling you a boy and two women
- and they were talking together - Mommy!
I did it yesterday!
This is the father, this is the mother, this is Victor
- and this is the old woman - What do these numbers stand for?
That' s the number of times I' ve seen them
I' ve seen the old woman the most
Mrs. Mills go and call Mr. Tuttle
Tell him that we have to search the whole house immediately
- Before it gets dark - Yes, ma' am
Nothing is going to happen to you while mommy is here
Look, mommy she really scares me
It' s as if she' s not looking at you but she can see you
And she' s always around saying: "come with me"
- Oh, Anne, don' t lie to me!
- Honestly, mommy and she asked me things
Victor told me she' s a witch
- What did she ask you?
- Things
Her breath smells
We have to open all the curtains
I don' t want any dark corners where someone could hide
- Yes, ma' am - You both search the right side and I' il take the left then we' il search upstairs
Perhaps they' re ghosts who lived in this house before
Don' t be stupid, I' ve already told you ghosts go about in white sheets and carry chains and go oooo!
Now, Anne, why do you make up such stories?
I don' t, I read them in books
Well, you shouldn' t believe everything that you read in books
That' s what our mother says
She says that all this stuff about ghosts is rubbish and then she expects us to believe everything written in the Bible
- And don' t you believe it?
- I believe some things
But, for example, I don' t believe that God made the world in seven days
And I don' t believe that Noah got all those animals into one boat or the Holy Spirit is a dove
- No, I don' t believe that either - Doves are anything but holy
They pooh on our windows
Have you mentioned any of this to your mother?
We' ve searched everywhere, ma' am, there' s no one
I see
Do you have any idea what this might be?
- It' s a photograph album, ma' am - No but look, they' re all asleep
- Look - They' re not asleep, ma' am, they' re dead
It is a book of the dead
In the last century, I believe they used to take photographs of the dead in the hopes that their souls would go on living through the portraits
There are even group portraits
And children!
Oh, it' s macabre!
How could these people be so superstitious?
Grief over the death of a loved one can lead people to do the strangest things
Get rid of it, I don' t want it in the house
Mrs. Mills, it' s cold why don' t you come and sit by the fire?
Thank you very much, ma' am
So, tell me about when you worked here before
Did you have to look after children then as well?
No, I was in charge of organizing the house work
- Were there many servants?
- Oh, about fifteen
- Why?
- My employers moved to London
They came here less and less it... being so out of the way like
So gradually the house just became empty
Everybody ends up leaving this damned island
My family left in the summer of 1940 just before the invasion
That was the last I' ve heard of them
I don' t blame them
Naturally, we left too
Although, you know, sometimes when you leave a place it' s like it' s there with you all the time
I always felt like I never left this house
Why did you leave?
Oh, it was on account of the tuberculosis, the whole area was evacuated
- Was that when Lydia went dumb?
- Yes, I think so
Though you know, my memory is a bit rusty these days, ma' am
What happened to her?
Well, suddenly one day, she just... stopped talking
Well, there must have been a reason, people don' t just stop talking
These things are always the result of some sort of trauma
Something must have happened to her
Did your employers treat you well?
Oh, they were always very kind to us, they treated us just like family
I' il never be able to get up in the morning
Off you go, I' m going to stay here a while longer
I' m sorry I was so hard on you
Can you forgive me?
- What?
- When is daddy coming home?
- When the war is over
Why did he go to war?
I mean, nobody has done anything bad to us
Daddy went... daddy went because he' s very brave and because he wasn' t prepared to let the Germans tell him what he had to do
Why?
Charles!
Where are you?
- What' s the matter, ma' am?
Give it to me
- Quickly!
- What' s happening, ma' am?
Come on!
Oh my God!
I checked that room myself, it was empty
- and yet...
- They will do you good
And yet I felt as if there was someone else there and it wasn' t human
There is something in this house, something diabolic
- Ma' am - Something which is not... not at rest
I know you don' t believe it, you don' t believe it, do you?
I don' t blame you, I, I used to not believe these things
I do believe it, ma' am I' ve always believed in those things
Oh, they' re not easy to explain but they do happen
We' ve all heard stories of the beyond now and then and I think that sometimes the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living
But it' s impossible the Lord would never allow such an aberration
The living and the dead they will only meet at the end of eternity
It says so in the Bible
Ma' am, there isn' t always an answer for everything
Where are you off to, ma' am?
I' m going to the village to pay father Legrand a visit
If he won' t come here then I shall go to him, I shall bring him back
Ma' am you should wait till the weather improves
I' ve waited long enough
- Ma' am, the priest told me that...
- I don' t care what he told you
I want him to tell me personally
- He must come today - But what are you going to tell him?
We have searched every room in there inch by inch and now I need them to be blessed
Ma' am, please wait it is still very early
- Mr. Tuttle - Good morning, ma' am
- Gravestones?
When my husband bought this house we were told there was a little cemetery
I think it was somewhere over there among the trees
- I' ve not seen anything - Check carefully
- They could be overgrown - Yes, ma' am
I need to know if there was a family buried here and if they had a little boy, Victor
Now she thinks the house is haunted
Do you think it' s safe to let her go?
Oh, don' t worry, the fog won' t let her get very far
Oh, yes, the fog!
The fog, of course!
And when... when do you think we should bring all this out into the open?
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle, all in good time
Speaking of which...
You' re here!
They said there was no hope
They said I should give you up for dead
They say a lot of things
Thank you!
Thank you, God!
Every night I' ve prayed for this! begging God to bring you back
Bring my children their father back!
But where have you been all this time?
Out there, looking for my home
You' re so different!
So different!
Sometimes I bleed
Mrs. Mills, this is my husband
- I' m very pleased to meet you, sir - He' s very weak
I want you to prepare a hot bath and some clean clothes
- And something to eat - Right away, ma' am
Hello, my little ones
Why did you take so long?
I told you, you see?
I told you he' il come back!
- Have you both been well behaving?
- We' ve been very good
- Very good
We study every day for our First Communion
Daddy, did you kill anyone?
Oh, here he comes
Darling, we' ve prepared lunch for you!
Are you coming down or would you prefer that...
- When is daddy coming down?
- Be patient, Anne
Daddy is... not well
He said he' d seen a lots of dead men
Mommy, when people die in the war where do they go?
What a question!
It depends
On what?
Well, on whether they fought on the side of the goodies or the baddies
Your father, for example, fought for England on the side of the goodies
How do you know who the goodies and the baddies are?
That' s enough questions, eat your food you' il never go to war
We' il never go anywhere
Oh, you' re not missing out on anything
You' re much better off at home with your mommy and your daddy who love you very, very much
- And the intruders?
- There are no intruders here
- But you said that there were...
- No, I said that there are no intruders here and I don' t want to hear another word on the subject
- But you said...
- That is enough!
- No!
- Why not?
- Because... because you can' t
Anne, stop breathing like that
Stop it!
Stop breathing!
You go to your room!
There' s no dessert for you today!
No crying, now!
No crying!
Oh, stop that, look what an awful face you' ve got when you cry
- I don' t care!
There!
You listen to me
- I' ve seen them too - You have?
Yes
Then maybe she' il believe me
There are things your mother doesn' t want to hear
She only believes in what she was taught
But don' t worry, sooner or later she' il see them
- Then everything will be different - How?
Oh, you' il see!
There are going to be some big surprises
- There are going to be... changes - Changes?
Now she' s behaving as if nothing had happened
- What about her daughter?
- Oh, she' s not so stubborn
The children will be easier to convince
No, it' s the mother who' s going to cause us problems
But do you think her husband suspects anything?
No, I don' t think he even knows where he is
Look what a pretty daughter I' ve got
Mommy made this veil especially for you
- I look like a bride - Yes, you do
I need to shorten the sleeves a little
- You can take it off now - No!
Anne, this dress has to be spotless for your First Communion
I promise I won' t dirty it
Oh!
Just a little!
Alright, I' il be back shortly
No!
Monsieur, would you like to dance?
I' d love to!
Charles, you can' t go on like this
You must eat something
Anne, you need to take the dress off now
Anne, are you listening to me?
What did I tell you about sitting on the floor?
But it' s clean
It makes no difference why can' t you ever do as you' re told...
- What' s the matter?
- Where is my daughter?
- What have you done with my daughter?
- Are you mad?
I am your daughter!
You' re not my daughter!
- Ma' am, I heard shouts!
- She wants to kill me!
She won' t stop!
She won' t stop until she kills us
- Hush, child, come with me - You' re wicked!
You' re wicked!
- How is she?
- There' s no calming her
So I left her with her father she insisted on speaking with him
What happened?
Why did you fight?
It wasn' t her!
It was the old woman with the strange eyes
She was imitating my daughter' s voice
I swear to God that it wasn' t my daughter!
God, help me!
God help me!
What' s the matter with me?
I don' t know what' s the matter with me
You must get more rest
You can' t take on the whole responsibility of this house
Leave it to us we know what has to be done
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean you know what has to be done?
Nothing, ma' am I was just suggesting...
There' s nothing to suggest
You have no idea what has to be done!
Or do you...
What are these?
The tablets for your migraine, ma' am, the ones you always take
Please, I need to be on my own
Come, child
Anne told me everything
I wish I had an explanation but I haven' t
First I thought there was someone else in the house even thought that they were ghosts
I' m not talking about the ghosts I' m talking about what happened that day
- I don' t know what you' re talking about - Tell me it' s not true
- Tell me what happened - Happened?
I don' t know what came over me that day, I...
The servants had left during the night they hadn' t the courage to tell me to my face
And they knew that I couldn' t leave the house
They knew!
Anne, what happened?
She hit me
She went mad like she did that day, do you remember?
No
- You must forgive me, Charles - Not me, the children
They know that I love them they know I' d never hurt them
I' d die first!
What are you going to do?
Are you angry with me?
I just came back to say goodbye to my wife and children
- Now I must go - Go where?
- To the front - The war is over!
- The war is not over - What are you talking about?
Do you hear me?
You left us once already!
You can' t go!
Why did you have to go to that stupid war that had nothing to do with us?!
Why couldn' t you have stayed here like the others did?
- They surrendered - We all surrendered!
The whole island was occupied what.. what did you expect?
What were you trying to prove by going to war?
Your place was here with us, your family
I loved you, that was enough for me
Living in this darkness, in this prison
But not for you I wasn' t enough for you
That' s why you left
It wasn' t just the war
You want to leave me, don' t you?
Grace
What is it?
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Where are the curtains?
Let me see!
Let me see!
Oh, you' re alright!
You' re alright!
I want my daddy
- Daddy' s gone - It' s not true!
Yes, it is, it is true
I love you, mommy
Find the curtains
Who was it?
Who did this?
Tell me!
Tell me!
You know what' s happening here! you know because it happened to you too!
Write it down!
Please!
That attitude won' t solve anything, ma' am
Anyway, she can' t write
- Where are they?
- What?
Someone has taken the curtains!
I have noticed, ma' am, there' s no need for you to raise your voice
Oh, Mr. Tuttle, I was just on the point of calling you
Did you know that someone has taken all the curtains?
The curtains?
Oh, dear!
Why should anyone want to take all the curtains?
Oh, to let some daylight into this house, I imagine
Daylight, of course
Someone wants to kill my children
Now why do you think that the daylight would kill them?
Are you mad?
I told you!
I already told you, the children are photosensitive, the light will kill them!
Yes, but that was before, the condition could' ve cleared up by itself
I mean, if you never expose them to daylight, how do you know they' re not cured?
My sister- in- law used to get terrible attacks of rheumatism in her legs and back
Then one fine day... they disappeared
I' m going to find those curtains and when you have finished helping me hang them, you will leave this house
And what about the master, ma' am?
What does he have to say about all of this?
Give me your keys!
I want your keys now!
I know what you want, you want to frighten us
You' ve wanted to take over this house ever since the first day you arrived
Now, you give me those keys, I will not ask again
Give them to me!
And now, get out of here
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?
I think I' ve reached the end of my tether
- What about you?
- Oh, yes, definitely
We' d better go and uncover the gravestones
What' s mommy doing?
I' ve already told you she' s gone mad
- She' s gone mad!
- Liar!
- She' s gone mad!
- She' s gone mad!
Liar!
- Night time - Where are you going?
I' ve had enough
I' m going to the woods to look for daddy
Are you going to run away?
If I hang on to the pipe, I can climb down to the ground, it' s very easy
If mommy finds out you' re in for it
Anne, wait!
I want to come and look for daddy too
Liar, you just don' t want to be left on your own, scaredypants, scaredypants!
Be quiet!
Anne, I think we' ve gotten lost
We still haven' t left the garden yet, silly
- I' m scared - You shouldn' t have come, then
- Say something - What shall I say?
I don' t know, anything
Let' s see, my name is Anne and I' m walking
I' m walking and my name is Anne...
What' s that over there?
- I think they' re graves - Don' t go near!
- Why not?
- What if a ghost jumps out?
Graves don' t have ghosts only skeletons
- There' s something written here - Let' s go!
Wait!
Anne, what does it say?
- You must be strong now, children - Nicholas, come here!
Mrs. Mills, please don' t tell mommy we' ve run away
Don' t speak to them!
- They' re dead!
- What?
- They' re ghosts, please come here!
You said that...
I don' t care what I said!
Get away from them
You' re always teasing me and telling lies
- and I' m sick of it!
- I' m not teasing you!
I' m telling the truth!
Come here!
Quick!
Children!
Run!
Don' t come any closer!
Don' t move!
Don' t trouble yourself, ma' am tuberculosis finished us off more than half a century ago
Go away!
- Open the door ma' am, please - What do you want?
Mommy, don' t open the door, don' t
- We' ve seen their graves - Go upstairs and hide
Don' t separate
Oh, Anne... whatever you do don' t separate!
- We' ve been trying to make you understand - Understand what?
About the house... about the new situation
What situation?
We must all learn to live together, the living and the dead
If you' re dead, leave us in peace!
Leave us in peace!
In here, get inside
And suppose we do leave you, do you think they will?
- Who?
- The intruders
- There are no intruders - They took the curtains down
- There are no intruders - Oh, yes, I assure you it was them
And now they' re in there with you and the children
- Waiting for you - No!
Yes!
And believe me, sooner or later, they' il find you
Listen, wait here and I' il be back in a minute
No, no, no, mommy said we shouldn' t separate
I can' t leave her on her own
Stop breathing like that!
Nicholas, stop breathing like that!
Stop breathing!
Can' t you hear it?
There' s someone there
Come with us...
Come with us
Where are you?
Answer me!
- The intruders have found them - There' s nothing we can do now
You' il have to go upstairs and talk to them
Our Father, who art in heaven hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
Why are you afraid, children?
Why don' t you want us to be your friends?
Come on, speak to us, speak to us
Tell me what happened
Don' t tell her!
If I tell her, they' il leave us in peace
Why are you crying, children?
What happened in this room?
What did your mother do to you?
- Something about a pillow - Is that how she killed you?
With a pillow?
She didn' t kill us!
Children, if you' re dead why do you remain in this house?
We' re not dead!
- Why do you remain in this house?
- We' re not dead!
We' re not dead!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, just a bit dizzy, that' s all
- What happened?
- They made contact
- All three?
- Apparently
Yes, the mother and the two children
- Quite interesting, don' t you think?
- Interesting?
- I was scared out of my wits!
No!
So far we have handled this matter your way
But now, you listen to me, we can' t possibly stay in this house any longer
It is quite clear that these beings do not want us to live here!
Yes, we do!
We know the woman went mad, smothered her two children and then shot herself
That' s quite enough, think of our son!
- There' s nothing wrong with Victor!
- Yes there is!
He says he has seen that girl!
And even this lady has been possessed by her!
- Please, let us leave this house!
- All right, we will leave tomorrow morning
Oh, thank God for that I' il just go and check on Victor
Once again, thank you so much for coming
A pleasure, I hope we' ve been of some help
Oh yes, of course but I must admit that was not the most...
At first I couldn' t understand what the pillow was doing in my hands
And why you didn' t move but then I knew...
It had happened!
I' d killed my children
I got the rifle, I put it to my forehead and I pulled the trigger
Nothing...
Then I heard your laughter in the bedroom
You were playing with the pillows as if nothing had happened
And I thought... the Lord, in his great mercy was giving me another chance telling me "don' t give up"
"Be strong, be a good mother... for them"
But now... now
Where are we?
Young Lydia said the very same thing when she realized the 3 of us were dead
And that was the last time she ever spoke
But I couldn' t tell you that before now
Shall I make us a nice cup of tea, ma' am?
The intruders are leaving, but others will come
Now sometimes we' il sense them and other times we won' t
But that' s the way it' s always been
Mommy... daddy died in the war, didn' t he?
- Yes - Will we ever see him again?
I don' t know
If we' re dead, where' s Limbo?
I don' t know if there even is a Limbo
I' m no wiser than you are but I do know that I love you
I' ve always loved you
And this house is ours, you say with me:
- This house is ours - This house is ours
- This house is ours - This house is ours
Mommy... look it doesn' t hurt anymore
No one can make us leave this house
Come along, Victor
The legend tells us that at one time, the empire offered its most beautiful girls to the Python- God in return for prosperity,,,
But, where today does our story unfold?
In which epoch?
Jean Cocteau said;
"Legends have the privilege of being ageless,"
So, it is as you please,
I salute you, people of Koumbi.
I salute your suffering, your poverty.
Men and women, children and adults, dead and living, nobles and slaves,
I am grateful to you all.
I salute Kaya Maghan and his people.
Woman!
The night belongs to spirits, the day belongs to doings.
Listen!
Hear you not the thunderbolt?
See you not the whirlwind?
Trapped!
Koumbi, you are trapped!
Kaya Maghan, leader of the universe!
They say your empire is boundless, stretching from east to west, from earth to sky.
But I, Kerfa, am not impressed.
I fear nothing!
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!
Kaya Maghan, your reign is eternal?
False!
Most false!
I say it loud and clear.
And I say it once again!
Let go of me!
See?
They fear my tongue yet they break my nose!
See the blood?
Look!
Look!
Kerfa, you are unreasonable.
What have you been saying?
Beware of those people.
The vulture does not sing.
The hyena does not dance.
People of Koumbi, wake up!
Sleep does not rule this world!
Goats who would be free!
Orphaned ewes!
Hide yourselves!
Stay away!
Be gone!
The cruel feast of Kaya Maghan begins!
Our customs are fundamental.
Most true.
Their root is memory.
Their fruit is the given word.
Welcome, honourable priests.
So the big day has come!
Indeed.
The oracles have spoken...
They have named Sia Yatabere.
She is the most beautiful, the most noble, and a virgin.
Deliver Sia to the Python- God' s lair.
There, we shall offer her up.
Now you shall speak.
Kaya Maghan, it is for us to speak.
Let that which has been said, be done.
Kaya Maghan hereby offers to Sia' s parents their daughter' s weight in gold.
Honourable, priests, beseech the Python- God to give us prosperity at last.
May he grant us long life, and to our children and grandchildren.
Forgive me.
But Sia Yatabere is not free of engagements.
She is the fiancée of my nephew Mamadi.
He is at the front, leading our armies.
How can we offer up Sia without telling him?
It would be best to choose another girl for the rite.
The oracles have chosen Sia, it is not up to us.
If this is how it must be,
I shall summon Mamadi so he can bid his farewells.
He must not come!
A soldier does not leave the front for his fiancée!
What has been given may not be taken back.
We cannot rob Mamadi of his betrothed.
Rob...
We are robbing nothing!
We are acting for the good of all!
Kaya Maghan, the head of your armies has blasphemed.
He must repent.
Out of the question.
I have not blasphemed.
I have spoken the truth.
What has been given may not be taken back.
- He is procrastinating.
Enough!
What has been said shall be done.
Wakhane, you are right.
But you spoke more as an uncle than as the head of my armies.
Mamadi shall be informed after the sacrifice.
What is it?
Nothing serious.
Then speak.
The priests came to see us...
We know.
Indeed...
They brought news to the palace.
Honour has come knocking on your door.
Balla, what do you mean?
Sia Yatabere, has been chosen...
Your daughter.
Balla, this news is overwhelming.
But tell our venerated emperor, if the country' s survival depends upon the sacrifice of my daughter, then so be it, may custom be respected.
Nobility is not given to everyone.
Of the Yatabere nobles, you are a thoroughbred,
Yatabere.
In your daughter' s stead the emperor gives you the equivalent of her weight in gold.
We will come for her.
Yatabere.
Fatou, dry your tears.
Our pain is great, but we must save our honour.
My daughter is to die and I must hold my tongue!
That beats everything!
You too will die...
Death spares no one.
We all die one day.
But Sia' s death is honourable.
Sia!
Sia, where are you going?
Do not flee.
Wait, listen to me.
Sia, my daughter...
Sia ran away.
It' s great!
I hope she holds out.
For the good of all, we must find her.
Stop blaspheming, it' s not good.
What?
Blaspheming?
Who' s fucking blaspheming?
A girl is to be murdered and you talk of blasphemy!
Mind your language, okay?
You' re taking risks...
Wakhane has ears all over the place.
I don' t want any trouble!
Let Wakhane do what he likes with me.
I' il not sanction heinous crimes!
Never!
Never ever!
Good day, noble folk!
Yatabere, we have come to fetch Sia.
Yatabere!
Worthy son of nobility!
We have come for Sia.
Sorry, but Sia fled in the night.
What?
Fled?
That' s impossible!
Where has she gone?
We looked for her, without success.
Search every room!
If she' s vanished, sparks will fly for you and for me.
But much more for you.
- Well?
- She' s not there.
Not anywhere.
Nowhere to be found.
We' il be back.
Find her!
- Where' s your friend Sia?
- I' ve no idea!
Let go of my daughter, she knows nothing!
Take her away.
She' s in cahoots!
Where is Sia?
Grandmother, where is she?
Search the house.
- No sign.
- Let' s go.
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!
What do you intend to do, Wakhane?
What shall you do?
Will you too pursue and deliver up Sia?
I am the head of the armies.
I have already told you, interests of State come before those of family.
Do you understand?
We have sought Sia in vain.
No trace of her in the town.
What?
You dare say that to my face?
Bunch of good- for- nothings!
I want Sia here within the hour.
She' s hiding in the town.
Arrest her parents immediately and all possible accomplices.
Away with you!
The emperor has announced that all accomplices of Sia shall be severely punished!
People of Koumbi!
Be reasonable!
Error is only human, but to persist in it, is diabolical!
People of Koumbi...
Python- God!
God who devours his children!
His most beautiful daughters!
Python most misshapen!
Deep in your stinking cave what do you know of beauty?
Be gone!
All our daughters are beautiful!
In fact, all is beautiful in Wagadu!
The earth, the sky, the sun, the stars, the water, even the wind!
Did you hear?
Break the skull of that blasphemer!
We have orders not to touch him.
Do not fear death!
Death spares no one,
If you are afraid, you will die,
Even if unafraid, you will die just the same,
Kaya Maghan offers 18 kilos of gold to whosoever succeeds in finding Sia!
Sacrificing human beings, how appalling,
Human life is sacred!
I declare it, most solemnly!
Sacrificing human beings, how appalling,
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!
Men and women!
Heed what I say!
Listen to the good news from the palace.
Kaya Maghan has announced that whosoever succeeds in finding Sia will be rewarded with 18 kilos of gold.
The word of our Emperor, Kaya Maghan!
Men and women of Koumbi!
Informers!
May you be cursed to damnation!
Kaya Maghan!
Master of the Universe!
No need to hurry!
You shall soon drown in the misery of your people!
Completely drowned!
Be patient, you wretch.
We' il have your hide.
Sia cannot have disappeared, it' s impossible.
Wakhane.
I want her at my feet... without delay.
Wakhane, laxity is rampant in this country.
That madman insults me all over town.
And you let him do it.
You must understand.
Kerfa would be more of a nuisance dead than alive.
As long as he speaks, he' s but a madman keeping the people amused.
But any violence unto him would make him a martyr.
You are right.
Now, find Sia.
As for the rest, we shall see later.
I know you enjoy Kerfa' s talk.
Kerfa is crazy, but not you.
Beat them good and well.
And you, do your job, castigate them.
Repeat:
Kaya Maghan the benefactor!
Python- God the saviour!
They give us rain!
They give us gold!
They protect us!
Very well.
Lock them up.
And make them talk.
Twins!
Close off the town and root out that girl.
Put down all subversion and resistance.
Soldiers!
With one exception.
Kerfa!
Don' t touch him.
He continually insults the emperor!
Do not touch him!
I said, not a hair on his head!
Is that clear?
It' s clear.
- Arrest them!
- It' s him!
- Who?
- You!
Why?
Let me go!
Take them away!
Let go of me!
Mercy!
That' il do!
I know you regularly hold subversive meetings.
True or false?
This farce has gone on long enough.
You will reveal Sia' s hideout.
Lock them up and put the screws on, until they talk.
Take them away!
Mercy!
Bring forth Sia' s parents!
Who are Sia' s parents?
Leave them be!
They are innocent.
Bunch of cowards!
Did you hear?
I wasn' t dreaming!
She insulted us!
Take her away!
Sacrifice me in Sia' s stead and stop torturing these people.
Even if they are accomplices, they' il never confess.
They prefer death to shame.
They' ve got balls.
And you have none!
This girl is possessed.
Lock the witch up!
On your feet!
So?
Still don' t want to confess?
We know nothing.
We have no reason to hide her.
Sia is not the first, nor will she be the last.
Penda is right!
If I were an accomplice, I' d never own up!
In this land, bastards have a name.
We ought to find one for unworthy fathers!
Woman, what do you mean by that?
Ignore her, she is beside herself, she is mad.
I am not mad!
Wakhane knows what I mean!
Let them go.
What?
Let them all go!
Why does Wakhane arrest everyone only to let them go?
Queen of queens, every ill has its remedy.
He knows what he' s doing.
It' s a subtle strategy!
Wakhane is hiding something from you.
Nothing!
Wakhane can hide nothing from me.
Without me, Wakhane is nothing.
The corpse doesn' t play hide and seek with the undertaker.
Fine!
Don' t say I didn' t warn you.
Cat is better than chicken,,, All a question of recipe,
Where is Sia?
Perhaps you know.
Good- for- nothing!
She is not here.
She wouldn' t hide out with a madman.
From now on, mind your manners, or we' il break your face, crazy old fool!
Move out!
Kerfa, I' m afraid.
I think he saw me.
Have no fear, they won' t be back.
I don' t want to die.
No one wants to die.
Who told you you' re going to die?
It' s done!
Come, it' s really good.
A delicious cat!
- No, I' m not hungry.
- Then hide.
You said they' d not be back!
Did I say that?
Perhaps it' s true!
But nothing is sure.
It all depends.
It' s red hot!
I don' t want to die.
Then, you' il not die!
How do you know?
The griots will one day tell the country' s children, that a young girl called Sia Yatabere was chosen from among the most beautiful to be sacrificed to the Python- God.
Her fiancé hastened to save her.
But Sia refused to flee.
In the name of all girls sacrificed, she preferred to brave death...
Speak, Kerfa!
I want to know all!
You' il know when the story has run its course...
If you still live.
But you said I won' t die.
I fear for my parents...
What does this story hold for them?
What does it hold for them?
They will be forgotten.
A father and a mother, are but a trifle.
A simple meeting.
- I' ve just seen Sia.
- Where?
In Kerfa the madman' s hut.
Did anyone else see her?
No, no one.
Then don' t tell a soul.
Have Mamadi return from the front as soon as possible.
So he can say his farewells to Sia.
Does Mamadi know I' m in danger?
Mamadi?
Who is Mamadi?
My fiancé!
You just spoke of him...
He' il come to save me.
Oh yes!
Mamadi!
He will come, but you won' t get far.
Why not?
Wakhane' s soldiers are everywhere.
And you, what does this story hold for you?
What matter!
All stories have their madmen, but madmen never have stories...
Sleep well, tomorrow will be a long day.
Well?
If your men don' t find Sia, choose another girl!
There are lots of other virgin, noble girls in this land.
Never!
It shall be Sia.
I gave my word.
My authority will not be bargained with.
There' il be no affront to my power.
Well said!
So what do you intend to do?
You speak of authority?
You have no more authority!
The people are party to this flight.
Your authority' s been ridiculed.
Your army leader will walk out on you.
I' m telling you again.
Your griot and your advisors are but your echo.
A bunch of yes men!
Wake up, quick, if you value your skin.
The fire burns the forest!
The water quells the fire!
The wind scatters the sand!
The greatest of great heroes, Cisse!
So, honourable court...
This Sia affair is threatening the stability of the country.
You too, may have your say.
Kaya Maghan wants to have your opinion on the situation.
Kaya Maghan, my investigation is progressing.
My men are mobilised.
They are working on it.
Give me one more day, just one!
And Sia will be at your feet.
Majesty!
The priests' patience has its limits.
We must save the people from the Python' s wrath.
The fate of the country is in our hands.
We must find another solution.
Balla, what do you think?
Absolutely, what matters is the sacrifice.
Never!
To give up on Sia, is a slight to my authority.
How could you dream of such a thing?
Majesty...
You are right...
You are totally right!
If we give up on Sia, the people will take it as a sign of weakness.
Wakhane!
Bring that madman here forthwith.
Fetch him here, I want to meet him.
Right!
That' s what we' il do.
Cut out the tongue of that madman who incites the people to disobedience.
Do not arrest him.
Have him come.
I want to see him, meet him, speak to him.
Speak to him?
That bothers you?
You, Kaya Maghan... speak to a madman?
I' d rather speak to a madman than to a bunch of puppet advisors, who are inapt and opinionless.
Kerfa the madman, we salute you,,,
Stop!
Little brats!
Kerfa!
Calm down!
Filthy urchins!
It' s you who are crazy.
Me, I have no name.
I even have no age.
I am invisible and imperceptible!
A curse on you!
And on your parents!
Malingering parents who abandon their children!
Let go of me!
What do you want?
- Move, scum!
- Shut it and move!
Get going!
Majesty!
Here is the man whose tongue has agitated the entire town.
This is he.
See?
They' d have my tongue, yet they bind my arms!
Stupid!
On your knees before justice!
No!
Never!
Never!
Is your rule on its knees?
If it is upright, I will remain standing!
Break his face and his legs!
On your knees!
Let him go!
Lay not a finger on him.
If he wishes, let him stand and let him speak!
Speak, me?
It is for you to speak.
I didn' t ask for an audience.
I' m giving you the chance to repent.
I shall offer your life to the priests for having blasphemed.
Kill me?
I' m not afraid of death!
I know how to wake up when I die.
Kaya Maghan, you are not like me.
If you die...
If you die, you do not know how to wake!
In fact, you are already dead, because you are asleep!
Sleep does not govern.
- Leave us.
- What?
Leave you alone?
This man is mad!
I am responsible for your safety.
I said leave us alone!
Untie him.
Out.
All of you!
So you are Kerfa the madman...
He who insults me all over town.
Despite all, I don' t wish to harm you.
I want you to speak for me too.
I want to be closer to my people.
Speak for you?
Out of the question!
You have too many!
The griots, the advisors, the soldiers, already speak but for you.
I am tired of hearing them.
They' re a bunch of yes men.
I' m awash in an ocean of complacency.
That' s why I need you!
I want to hear the voice of my people!
Kaya Maghan seeks his people!
Listen awhile to the murmurs of the town.
I have often listened, yet neither joy nor pain comes to my ears.
Help me.
I want to know my people better.
He wants to know his people better.
Your people are there!
Outside!
But tomorrow, they will trample you and sing for another tyrant.
The voice of the people is clear!
It resounds like an emperor' s fart, a fart that everyone pretends not to hear!
Who are you?
Me?
I am but the dream of others.
- The dream of others?
- Right!
Then Kerfa, be my dream too!
Dream for my people!
- What' s this?
- Here.
- What?
- Take the throne and dream.
Me?
Never!
Keep your throne!
My dreams belong to me alone!
Nothing is anyone' s!
All belongs to me, even you and your madness!
Leave my madness alone!
Hands off!
Let me seek myself.
Me, I seek myself!
He is already dead!
Kaya Maghan is dead!
Kerfa!
I will kill you!
I' il wipe you out!
Kill me?
But I am already dead!
Dead, but awake!
Every day I die.
If you cannot die and wake, you are nothing!
Believe me...
Nothing!
- Still here...
- Where were you?
- At the palace, with Kaya Maghan.
- Kaya Maghan?
Yes, with Kaya Maghan.
- They' re going to kill me too.
- Kill you?
Why?
Because of me?
No, because of myself.
They wanted my dreams, my madness.
Not just anyone can be mad!
You must earn it!
Kaya Maghan is thinking ahead, he wants to be rid of his advisors, his priests.
He wants to reach out to the people before the revolt.
But it' s too late.
The wind is against him.
The force of the waves will engulf him.
What are you on about?
I don' t understand a thing!
He wants to make a hippopotamus of me and hang onto my back.
What he wants is...
I don' t care what Kaya Maghan wants.
I want to live!
Live!
Women!
You can never fathom them!
She has the honour of being the prettiest and she gets angry!
The honour of the sacred sheep!
I am not a sheep, I am a woman!
I don' t want to be sacrificed.
Help me.
Get up.
Listen...
Dry your tears.
He' s coming.
Who?
Who?
Your horseman!
Mamadi!
He who acts more than he speaks.
We' il see if he deserves his reputation.
Come!
Kerfa, I' m lost for what to do.
Whatever you do, the story will run its course.
Follow your instinct!
Come, I' il take you away!
I thank you for having come, but we won' t get far.
Your uncle' s men are everywhere.
Nothing can stop me.
Let' s be gone from here.
Be gone from here?
You mean, flee from here!
Always fleeing!
Some valiant soldier you are!
Don' t touch him!
He saved my life.
I' d have cut your head off!
Thanks to Sia, I spare you.
You fool!
My head wouldn' t make you a hero.
Go see the Python, he has seven.
You can chop off as many heads as you like.
Be off!
I' il stay here and wait for death.
Very well!
I' ve understood.
Come and hide, carnage is brewing.
Come.
I' m scared, Mamadi is risking his life.
Risk?
Risk is everywhere!
There' s as much risk at the front as in town...
Come and hide...
Come.
Come!
Seize her!
Kerfa!
Let go of me!
Sia!
Don' t worry!
Whatever happens, I will be there with you!
In the Python' s lair!
My uncle, you have betrayed me.
I' ve betrayed no one.
You have said your farewells to Sia as was my duty.
Now you have seen her, go back to your post.
I will never abandon Sia.
Then I must arrest you for desertion.
I no longer obey Kaya Maghan.
Mamadi!
Listen!
Whatever you do, Sia will be sacrificed.
There is nothing you can do, I' ve already arrested her.
You dare deliver my fiancée to death with your own hands?
Sia' s death is no less worthy than the death you court at the front.
Sia must die for the entire country.
Sia will not die.
I shall kill the Python.
What?
Did I hear you right?
I shall kill the Python to save Sia.
You would kill the Python- God and dare say it to the head of the armies?
I say it to my uncle.
It' s up to you, whether the uncle or the general heard me.
This boy has lost his wits.
Lock him up!
Do as I say!
Listen!
We must take to the streets and say no to Kaya Maghan and his priests.
No way!
You' re crazy!
Forgotten what we' ve been through?
Have you forgotten?
Next time they' il cut our balls off.
Get out of here!
You lily liver!
Kaya Maghan is neither devil nor genie.
He' il not wipe us out!
He needs us in order to exist!
Fine, if you want to die, off you go.
Stop blubbering and work!
We bring grave news.
Fraught with consequences.
Twins, speak!
Wakhane is preparing a coup d' Etat.
Mamadi has returned from the front to help him.
But they haven' t yet made their move.
We spied upon their plot.
We must act quickly!
Are you sure of your accusations?
Of course, go to Wakhane' s, Mamadi is there.
Wakhane has never been clear.
He must be dismissed.
Balla!
Go and get Keletigui.
Discreetly.
I appoint him head of my armies.
Let him organise Wakhane' s arrest.
At once!
Good day, where is your husband?
He' s sleeping.
Sleeping?
You seem pretty worked up.
Wake him.
It' s very urgent.
Keletigui, grave news.
Wakhane is preparing a coup d' Etat.
The emperor has named you in his stead.
Quick, to the palace...
- Wait, who' s spreading this gossip?
- The twins!
They overheard Wakhane and Mamadi plotting to kill the Python- God.
This information is false.
In any case, I shall remain loyal to my general, Wakhane!
It' s false, isn' t it?
That' s what I told the whole court.
Wakhane could never do such a thing, he' s no traitor!
Release your nephew, you are of the same blood.
We have given enough.
I repeat, the interests of State come before those of family.
Bad news, the emperor is out for your blood.
Why?
What' s going on?
I' m telling you, it' s serious.
The priests accuse you of plotting against Kaya Maghan.
They' re sure of it.
The twins told them.
Kaya Maghan has already dismissed you.
You' re in real trouble.
Keletigui!
Free Mamadi.
The emperor has lost his mind.
He' s flipped!
You saw him!
He wanted to ally with Kerfa the madman.
We are all in danger.
Careful!
Great Master, from the dawning of time, we have been your griots.
You well know, I wish to die by your side.
Untie him.
- Where is Sia?
- There is no time to lose.
Rally our troops and meet me at the caves.
Incredible!
Never does the vulture sing!
Never does the hyena dance!
People of Koumbi, you are cursed!
I hate your songs and dances.
They stink!
Blind tam- tams!
Deaf tam- tams!
Blind tam- tams...
Deaf tam- tams...
Wakhane, Keletigui and Mamadi deserted before my very eyes.
Exactly as we feared.
They must be found, arrested before they act.
Balla!
I entrust the troops to the twins.
May they bring back Wakhane dead or alive!
Twins, the troops are yours.
What are you waiting for?
Follow me.
- You want we act together?
- Yes, of course.
It gives me the chance to make amends.
I have been tormented by a feeling of guilt.
"Little- Mother"?
Yes.
Who is "Little- Mother"?
My daughter...
Your cousin, "Little- Mother".
You don' t remember, you were only a child.
At sixteen, they delivered her up to the Python.
I' il never forget the look on her face that day.
Her distraught antelope eyes, begging.
- My poor uncle...
- Let me speak.
There is a time for everything.
Do not console me, I am not to be pitied.
I am an unworthy father.
You know what "Little- Mother" said to me on the day of the sacrifice?
Do you know?
She said:
"Father!
You always told me that death was invisible.
"I am not afraid of death.
"It is the serpent that I fear...
"I don' t want to see the Python!"
Do you know what I did that day?
Do you know?
I refused!
I closed my eyes so not to see her tremble...
I sinned out of sheer pride.
I didn' t want that a girl of my flesh and blood tremble before death.
Uncle, for "Little- Mother" and for Sia, we must kill this monster.
Kaya Maghan named me head of the armies to console me for her loss.
But it is impossible to forget.
My only reason to live is to take revenge upon myself.
Mamadi, listen well.
What I' m about to tell you is capital.
Tomorrow, I will make you Kaya Maghan.
- Kaya Maghan?
- Right.
I don' t understand.
You want to kill the Python- God.
When one kills the gods, one must reinvent the world.
I don' t want to reinvent the world!
All that matters to me is Sia.
You have no choice.
If you refuse, I lay down our arms, we are arrested, Sia is sacrificed.
Is that your wish?
So be it, Uncle.
But why not you?
No, you know how unpopular I am.
I have inflicted too much suffering upon the people.
They' il not forget that.
I' ve told you before, the people need heroes.
Majesty, the town is on state of alert.
We have the situation under control.
There is nothing to fear.
And my people?
Are my people worried?
- What do they say?
- Your people?
Your people is calm.
We' ve imposed a curfew.
The streets are empty.
Good luck.
Move out!
So...
What news of Kerfa the madman?
You ordered me to protect him.
Your instructions have been respected.
Now... do away with him... and spread the rumour that Kaya Maghan had him killed because of his blaspheming.
Go!
Let go of me!
You, you, you...
This way.
The others, that way.
Remove your caps.
You, that way.
What happened?
The Python doesn' t exist...
Does it?
So what happened?
The priests raped me.
They stole my virginity.
All seven set fire to my belly.
You should have let me die.
I' d rather death... than life.
I am completely sullied.
I want to die.
I want to die.
Catch them!
Where is Kerfa?
Kerfa!
Kerfa promised to die there with me...
Kerfa!
Well?
How did it go?
Answer me!
Have you lost your tongues?
The Python- God doesn' t exist.
What?
What are you saying?
In the lair, there were only some human skeletons.
No python?
And the priests?
They raped Sia.
They were preparing to kill her, we put them all to death.
Here are their soutanes.
Let no one move from here.
Wait for my instructions.
How is she?
I don' t know.
She' s not speaking.
Come...
It is not over.
So...
We have to keep this news secret.
What do you mean?
We shall pretend that you killed the Python- God.
You will be "the emperor who dethroned a god".
But it' s not true!
I' ve already told you, the people need heroes.
You are a good soldier, a fine master of arms, but your political education is wanting.
I will take care of it.
Some secret!
All my men know about it!
I' il see to them.
The real danger, is Sia...
Sia?
Why Sia?
You have killed the Python- God, in the eyes of the people you will be a god.
Sia must preserve the mystery of this power.
Return by her side.
Go...
Go on!
Give that here.
I am proud of you.
You' ve done a good job.
But... this news must be kept secret.
I will entrust you with another mission.
Wait here.
You, go tell Keletigui to meet me in my cave.
Hurry!
Greetings!
Come in, I was expecting you.
The soldiers who were present must die immediately.
They must speak to no one.
As you wish.
Consider it done!
Off you go!
Traitors!
Got what they deserved.
Bury them together.
Do you hear this din around the palace?
Lay down your arms!
The Python- God is dead!
All the troops have sided with us!
Never!
Not on your life!
We' il fight to the last man!
- To arms!
- Live or die!
What' s going on?
I hear cries outside.
What are my soldiers doing?
I want to know!
I' il go see.
Lay down your arms!
There must be no slaughter!
Why?
It cannot be!
Kaya Maghan has ordered it!
Lay down your arms!
Tell the others outside!
Lay down your arms!
Kaya Maghan has ordered it!
Follow me!
Valorous liberators!
Follow me!
Saviours of the people!
The puppet Kaya Maghan is overthrown!
Move!
No power is eternal.
You have long oppressed the people, now it' s your turn.
We' re arresting you!
Wait!
Respect him!
He was our emperor.
Do not tie him.
Show some tact.
Take him away!
Do your work!
Mother!
Mother!
Sia has been saved!
What?
The python is dead!
Mamadi killed it!
Incredible!
Out!
Understand?
Out with you!
Hurry up!
Let' s go!
Give them provisions and escort them out of the country.
Take them away.
Long live Mamadi!
Long live Mamadi!
Let go of me!
Don' t get so worked up!
This business is far from clear.
You' re always so sceptical.
- Beat it!
- Same to you!
Long live Mamadi!
Everything' s ready.
They' re waiting for us.
Very well, go and get Sia.
Right away.
Sia!
Most beautiful of queens, it is time to emerge!
Sia, I' m talking to you, Mamadi is waiting.
Sia!
All is ready, the people are waiting.
What' s come over her?
What' s wrong with her?
Come, it is time.
Let' s go!
What is Balla up to?
The people are calling for us.
The people are getting restless.
Let' s go!
I do not speak of puppet heroes!
I do not speak of ordinary heroes!
But of heroes who defy all heroes, who have vanquished the underworld, who have overthrown a god, who have ended the bloodthirsty reign of Kaya Maghan.
Heroes of the people!
The dog who defies the panther!
The lizard who defies the crocodile!
The people are proud of you!
The new... new...
Kaya Maghan!
Your will is our will!
We salute you!
We salute you!
Hero of heroes!
Wakhane of noble lineage!
We salute Wakhane Sakho, uncle of the new Kaya Maghan.
People of Koumbi!
People of Wagadu!
The murderous god, the Python is no more!
Kaya Maghan is no more!
They are dead!
Henceforth, you are free!
We shall open all the prisons!
Our new power is the power of the people!
Your power!
Sia!
Empress Sia!
We salute her!
We salute her!
The new empress is tired after her ordeal.
An ordeal, such as only heroes can surmount.
Let her rest a little.
In a few moments, she will shine like the full moon...
Here I am!
Mamadi, what' s going on?
What is going on?
Sia, listen to me...
Heroes who tremble...
When I will have told all you will tremble even more.
It is we who saved your life.
We can reduce you to silence.
You want to perpetrate a lie?
To change falsehood into truth?
Sia, do not wreck our hopes...
I was raped, Mamadi.
I was raped, sullied.
Be patient.
She is not yet over the shock.
Give her a little time.
Mamadi, that' s enough.
Now you must choose.
Either she perishes, or we do.
Let me handle this.
Keletigui!
Take her away!
Wait!
Arrest him for cruelty to the people!
Arrest him, I am the new Kaya Maghan!
Keletigui!
I said arrest that girl!
Is that clear?
Arrest her!
Mamadi, my nephew, well played...
You did well...
You' re a quick learner...
Ah!
"Little- Mother"...
When I think of my daughter...
She, who was so scared... of snakes.
Keletigui!
I name you head of my armies!
Take Wakhane away.
He was a great leader.
The new Kaya Maghan is dead!
Dead in the well of endless falsehood!
Dead from the very beginning!
That he die...
That he live...
What matter!
Let go of me!
Don' t touch me.
There' s no use in dying if you don' t know how to wake up.
Keletigui!
Take this madwoman out!
Kaya Maghan is dead.
Let her be gone.
She has lost her wits.
I salute you all!
I salute Kaya Maghan and his people!
The night belongs to spirits, the day belongs to doings!
People of Koumbi, wake up sleep does not rule this world!
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!

I got out of the institution on the day of my sister' s wedding.
I' d started to get used to the place... breakfast at 8: 00, classes at 2: 00, therapy at 4: 00 and asleep by 10: 00.
You can call me anytime, Lee.
I will always try and be of help to you.
Inside, life was simple.
Thank you, Dr. Twardon.
For that reason, I was reluctant to go.
Bon voyage.
Hi, Peter.
Peter, yeah, who you almost successfully forgot.
No, I did not.
Are you happy to be home?
I mean, are you happy to be home?
How did you know?
I know what you mean.
You Iook so beautiful.
Thanks, Dad.
I thought you stopped.
Do you know how much we missed you, pumpkin?
I missed you too.
I don' t feel so good.
Let' s go sit down.
You want to talk to me like a child.
You act like a child!
You don' t act like a man.
I' m glad I' m fired.
Boy, I hated that job.
I don' t care that you hated it.
You' re drunk!
Why do you... why do you...
Why do you always say that?
Watch this, huh?
Avoid the temptation of placing your fingers on the home keys by sight.
Strike each key so that your fingers bounce with each stroke.
Do not strike without thinking.
Do not even attempt to steaI a glance at your paper.
'My flowers had just about given up in despair, so with the exception of a few potted plants from the florist, we' re flowerless for the first spring in years.'
And... time.
I' m so proud of you, honey... being out in the world like this.
When my accident happened we were in the kitchen and my back was to her.
Upstairs, my dad was just leaving for work at Havis Department Store.
Because there was a limited amount of time that my mom' s back was turned...
- I slipped and cut too deep.
I' m not sure how I could have misjudged.
I' ve been doing it since 7th grade.
Just a precaution.
'Be a leader.'
I have never had a job before.
But I can assure you that I am very excited about this opportunity.
Thank you.
I don' t have any references yet.
But I think that the Municipal Tax Office would be a wonderful place... to begin... my career.
'Secretary.'
Hello, I...
I...
Hello?
In here.
Are you the lawyer?
Yes.
I' m sorry, I' il come back later.
No, stay.
It said, 'secretary.'
That' s right.
Are you pregnant?
No.
Do you plan on getting pregnant?
No.
Are you living in an apartment?
- A house.
Alone?
- With my parents.
Siblings?
My sister is going to live in the backyard, with her husband, in the pool house.
Are you married?
No.
Yes.
- What did you win the award in?
Typing.
Are those your scores?
Lee...
Holloway.
Could you get me a cup of coffee with sugar?
Do you really want to be a secretary, Lee?
Yes, I do.
You scored higher than anyone I' ve ever interviewed.
You' re really overqualified for the job.
You' d be bored to death.
- I want to be bored.
I have a part- time paralegal.
All I need is a typist, who can get to work on time... and answer the phone.
We only use typewriters here, not computers.
That' s fine.
- It' s very dull work.
I like dull work.
There' s something about you.
You' re... you' re... closed tight.
Wall.
I know.
Do you ever loosen up?
I don' t know.
I' m not here.
Less sugar in the coffee.
How did it go?
I got it.
I knew you could do it!
You have reached the office of Mr. E. Edward Grey.
Please leave your message and the time you called along with your phone number and the best time to reach you... and we... will get back to you as soon as possible. '
Secretary...
Type up this letter and send four copies to O' Malley & Barrett.
Right away, sir.
That' s good.
That' s good.
So you' re the new secretary?
What exactly is a paralegal?
See ya.
Okay... up... and... wide.
I brought you these.
I think I accidentally threw out my notes on the Feldman case.
Maybe you could...
- Go through the garbage?
Yes, Lee, thank you.
Why are you here?
I' m just waiting for you, honey.
But I' m here for five more hours.
I know.
Excuse me, sir?
I found another set.
This needs more sugar.
- Sugar?
And six copies of these.
Freshen up that trap, Lee, and put out one more.
Mice like to go behind the chairs too, Lee.
Just because it' s hard to reach... does not mean we don' t take care of every possibility.
Here, give me that.
Thank you.
E. Edward Grey' s office, may I help you?
Thanks, though.
Is he in?
You' re right, that is a very good offer.
I' m going back now.
- Could you wait one minute, please?
Yes, I do understand that.
Submissive.
Excuse me?
Edward!
I have no idea if we make... over $40 worth of long distance calls to Chattanooga each month.
Tell him it' s Tricia O' Connor.
Mr. Grey?
Ms. Holloway.
I' m not here.
Okay.
I' m afraid he' s gone.
Is that right?
E. Edward Grey' s office.
Is that you honey?
It' s me.
It' s so good to hear your voice.
Dad... where are you?
I' m downtown... somewhere.
Could you please hold?
Do you have a message, Ms. O' Connor?
Tell him to sign the settlement.
How' s work?
Fine.
How' s Mr. Grey?
He' s fine.
Peter called.
Yes.
- And then you got... your more laid- back folk, who will wash this stuff when it' s dirty.
Which kind are you?
I' m the type of guy... who wants to get married and have a kid.
I wash my clothes just when they' re dirty.
Me too, and that is what counts in a relationship.
Compatibility.
In a relationship?
- In a... relationship.
May I interest you in a little more?
Just a little more?
You' re different than you were in high school, Peter.
I' ve changed.
What happened?
- I had a nervous breakdown.
Sort of.
Tom, I have this and these.
Peter?
- Yes, Lee?
I' ve read that if you wear that kind of underwear that it squeezes... your 'thingies.'
Balls... my balls?
My 'grapes'?
- Your grapes.
- Your testicles.
Your sperm gets' squozen 'and then you can' t have babies... and I thought that you said that you wanted to have babies.
There you go, I said it.
To babies.
Diapers.
Diaper rash.
Breast feeding and crying.
Look at it.
Do you see that?
- What?
This letter has three typing errors in it, one of which is, I believe, a spelling error.
I' m sorry.
- This isn' t the first time, either.
There have been others that I let go... in the first few weeks.
This cannot go on.
Do you know what this makes me look like... to the people who receive these letters?
I' m sorry.
Type it again... and get it right.
You' re wasting my time.
Bye.
Go type up a bill for that woman for $500.
Aren' t you going to proofread the letter?
Lee... when people come into this office,... you are a visual representation of my business... and the way you dress is disgusting.
Sorry.
You' re tapping your toe all the time and playing with your hair.
You' re either going to have to wear a hair net or stop playing with your hair.
And another thing... do you realize that you are always sniffling?
I' m sniffling?
And what is with your tongue... when you' re typing?
I' m sorry, I didn' t know I sniffled.
Well, you do.
'Mr. Grey... thank you so much for your helpful suggestions.
Because I am trying to be... the very best secretary that I can be for you. '
The sentence should read,...
'Without proper guidance from a knowledgeable source,... my client would never have made... these material decisions on her own.' Period!
I have repeated the sentence...
Are you sure you wouldn' t like some wine?
We make it homemade, don' t we, Stewart?
Try it, it' s good.
- Would you like some, Lee?
No, thank you.
Not right now, Sylvia.
Peter talks about you all the time.
He says he' s found his soul mate.
Did you say that?
I did.
- Peter' s sister Lindsey... is getting married this coming winter in Vegas.
Did you know Peter has a very stable job at J. C. Penney?
They even gave him a cell phone.
- Perhaps it' II be a double wedding?
Ms. Holloway.
Come into the library... immediately.
'... the remarks made in print,... in summation of the events in regard... to the Rubin Berkowitz libel.
Yours sincerely, 'etc.
The phone is ringing.
Answer it.
This is the office of... '
Listen... you' re a big girl.
You can get a much bigger voice out of that tiny throat of yours.
Tiny?
- Ms. Holloway,... you told me when I hired you that you were used to answering phones.
I am.
Did you get enough sleep last night?
I...
- The phone is ringing.
'Hello... this is the office of Mr. E. Edward Grey.'
You see?
That' s showing a little spunk.
I' m not running a mortuary.
No.
Lee.
Mr. Grey...?
Come here.
Did you have a date recently?
Yes.
With whom did you have a date?
Peter.
- Peter.
Did you have sex?
No?
I don' t know.
Are you shy?
I' m shy.
You' re not shy.
You' re a lawyer.
I' m shy.
I overcome my shyness... in order to get things done.
I don' t think you' re shy.
Lee, I' m going to be frank with you.
I know I' m your employer... and we have a proscribed relationship...
but you really should feel free... to discuss your problems with me.
What' s going on with the sewing kit and the Band- Aids?
Shy.
Do you want some hot chocolate?
Why do you cut yourself, Lee?
I don' t know.
Is it that sometimes the pain inside has to come to the surface... and when you see evidence of the pain inside... you finally know you' re really here?
Then when you watch the wound heal it' s comforting, isn' t it?
that' s a way to put it.
I' m going to tell you something.
Are you ready to listen?
- Are you listening?
You will never... ever... cut yourself again.
Do you understand?
Have I made that perfectly clear?
You' re over that now.
It' s in the past.
Never again.
I want you to leave work early.
You' re a big girl... a grown woman,... your mother doesn' t need to pick you up every day.
I want you to take a nice walk home,... in the fresh air, because you require relief.
Because you won' t be doing that anymore, will you?
No, sir.
Good.
Oh, it' s early.
I' m going to walk home from now on.
I took a shortcut through Hawkins Park,... and it was as if I' d never taken a walk by myself before.
I realized that I had probably never had taken a walk alone.
But because he had given me the permission to do this... because he' d insisted I do it, I felt held by him as I walked along.
I felt he was with me.
At the same time I was feeling something growing in Mr. Grey... an intimate tendril creeping from one of his darker areas,... nursed on the feeling that he had discovered something about me.
The next day I didn' t even bring my cuticle scissors and my iodine... but I did make another typing mistake.
What is wrong with you?
That is all you have to do... type and answer the phones.
I' m sorry.
- It certainly seems to be.
- Don' t apologize to me.
What goes on inside that head of yours?
Come into my office and bring that letter.
Put the letter on my desk.
I want you to bend over the desk so you' re looking directly at it.
Get your face very close to the letter and read the letter aloud.
I don' t understand.
There' s nothing to understand.
Put your elbows on the desk... bend over... get your face close to the letter and read it aloud.
I' m grateful to you for referring... '
Continue.
Ms. Holloway, read.
'... for referring me to your case.
The subject of animal captivity... has been of interest to me for quite a while,... and my secretary has prepared... research material... that I think you will find illuminating.
If you would be so kind... as to send me the June 5th Ietter of which we spoke,... my associates and I will review it immediately.
Please feel free to call me at your earliest convenience.
Yours sincerely, E. Edward Grey. '
Read it again.
'for referring me to your case.
The subject of animal captivity has been of interest to me... '
'... for quite a while.
And my secretary has prepared research material... that I think you will find illuminating. '
Now straighten yourself up and go type it again.
Ms. Holloway?
Good letter.
The lock can come off the cabinet now.
Oh, honey.
Replace the light bulb in the hallway to my office.
120 watts.
Mr. Grey.
- Good to see you again, Mr. Garvey.
You remember my secretary, Ms. Holloway.
I' m sorry about the typo.
It' s porterhouse steak, mashed... no... creamed potatoes, green peas, iced tea and ice cream.
Four peas... and as much ice cream as you like to eat.
'Cosmo' s' advice for 'getting your man... to share his feelings more intimately' is to first try some 'breezy humor.'
Whatever you do, don' t jump too quickly into 'relationship talk.'
I' m your secretary.
Just one scoop of creamed potatoes, one slice of butter... oh... and four peas...
How many inches away was the furnace...?
Had you turned off the furnace before you went down into the basement?
Okay... maybe you didn' t squeeze it hard enough.
There' s always concern about it bursting.
I haven' t had time to get to that.
I' m doing as much as I possibly can.
Where was she when you crawled under the house?
Did you cover it with dirt before you left?
Mud upstairs?
No, I' m confused by that.
Ah, but... this was the overweight child or your nephew from Baltimore?
On the banister.
I have to work.
Give me a week and I' il have something for you.
I' m sorry, the office has been... overwhelmed.
Mr. Grey, I' m going to go home now.
If you need any more typing done I could come back later.
Thank you, Ms. Holloway.
Good night.
That will be all.
He asked me out to Red Lobster the other night for a nightcap.
And yesterday he asked if my hose were control top... and if they were, I certainly didn' t need it.
- Yeah.
You should sue him for sexual harassment.
My lawyer is representing a woman who' s suing her boss for sexual harassment.
Is he a good lawyer?
He' s the best.
'He' s the best.'
- How long will he be there?
Who was that?
He checked himself into the hospital.
Yes, Lee?
I...
I just wanted...
I needed you...
I wanted you to...
You need me to what?
I just wanted you to not forget to go over the Lynch papers for tomorrow.
That' s good.
Thank you, Lee.
After he turned me away from his house,... he put me back at my old desk and he just stopped doing it.
He threw out all his red pens.
I kept making typos... but he just treated me like a regular old secretary.
Are you coming?
After a while I began to wonder if that was all I was.
Have we received any checks from Mr. Garvey?
No, sir.
File these.
That' s a pretty tie.
What?
Your tie... it has golfers on it.
Right.
Damn it.
Don' t be scared.
I' m not.
That' s not what I meant.
I' m sorry.
Look here, see...
I' m sorry.
Okay... but my clothes get to stay on and I want the lights out.
I didn' t hurt you, did I?
No.
Ms. Holloway?
Yes, Mr. Grey?
Come in to my office.
But Mr. Marvel is waiting.
Ms. Holloway, come in to my office.
Finally.
Ignore it.
Now pull up your skirt.
Why?
You' re not worried that I' m going to fuck you, are you?
I' m not interested in that, not in the least.
Now pull up your skirt.
I said, pull up your skirt.
I' m not going to be able to come to the diner today, okay?
That' s okay, 'cause... it' s all right.
Pull down your pantyhose and underwear.
I told you I' m not going to fuck you.
Get these forms filled out.
And then you can take your lunch break.
Bring me my sandwich, I' m eating in.
And... go have the usual.
No mayonnaise this time.
And... send in what' s- his- name.
Mr. Grey.
Place your prick in my mouth.
Screw me.
Mayonnaise.
Orchid.
Edward.
Most people think that the best way to live is to run from pain.
But a much more joyful life... embraces the entire spectrum of human feeling.
If we can fully experience pain as well as pleasure,... we can live a much deeper and more meaningful life.
Ms. Holloway?
Yes, sir?
- Bring your typing scores.
What happened?
Are you pregnant?
No.
Do you plan on being pregnant?
- Could I...
You plan on getting pregnant?
No.
Are you living in an apartment?
A house.
Alone?
- With my parents.
Are you married?
No.
Are those your scores?
Yes.
Do you really want to be my secretary?
Yes, I do.
- No, sir.
What?
No, sir.
I like you Lee, but I don' t think I' m going to offer you the job.
Why?
It' s your behavior.
What about my behavior?
It' s very bad.
I' m sorry.
You can collect your things.
Time out.
- Time out?
You' re fired.
- You' re fired!
You' re fired!
Now, Lee.
Why did you get glue smear all over the Ramsey papers?
Because I was fixing your shredder.
You saw me.
Are you aware you kick your shoes off under your desk?
Do you ever change your pantyhose?
Every day.
- Every time you erase... there are little shavings all over your desk.
I told you to take that Walkman home.
I don' t want the possibility of your listening to music... when you' re supposed to be working for me.
I know it' s there.
I' il move it.
You have to go or I won' t stop.
Don' t.
I cannot do this anymore.
But I want to know you.
I' m so sorry for what happened between us.
I realize what a terrible mistake I made with you.
And I can only hope that you understand.
Be assured you can count on me for excellent references.
Get out.
Get out.
What are you do...
- Get out!
I opened the envelope the second I got home.
It was a check for $680.
More than he actually owed me.
It occurred to me to tear up the check, but I didn' t.
I felt like I was doing the right thing.
And I didn' t tell anybody about any of it.
I pretended to go to work as usual,... and watched his office from across the street.
He hired a new girl and changed the locks on the doors.
There was just nothing for me to do about it.
My doctor at the institution once said,...
'Every journey begins with the first step.'
So I decided it was time to meet someone new.
There was one who tried to grab and pinch my nipples... before we even made it to his car.
Another guy kept ordering me to pee on his patio... and when I refused, he said...
- I thought you were a masochist.
- Thank you.
For a while I stopped trying and stayed at home... helping Dad adjust to his new sobriety.
Until one day, out of the blue,...
Peter proposed marriage to me in the basement of J. C. Penney' s.
I think I said yes because I didn' t know what else to do.
I guess I was a little lighter than you in those days.
If you hold your breath through the wedding, you' il make it.
I' m going to get Stewart.
You' re beautiful, you' re just too beautiful.
Where are you going?
I have something to say to you.
I love you.
Lee, you should not be here.
I love you.
I' m sorry, I... but I don' t believe that to be true.
Well, it is true.
This matter was resolved... when I received your canceled severance check.
I love you.
We can' t do this 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Why not?
Put both your hands on the desk, palms down.
I want to make love.
Keep both your feet on the floor until I come back.
- In case you' re wondering,... your fiancée is at my office.
Lee, I' m very fond of you as well...
Oh, it' s you.
Lee, what are you doing?
I don' t know how to deal with...
I' m sorry, I' m going to have to ask you to leave.
I' m your fiancé, Lee.
You are trespassing.
You are making an unwarranted incursion... a gradual or stealthy entrance into the sphere of another.
Okay, Lee... are you doing something... sexual, right now?
Does this look sexual to you?
I don' t know, Lee!
Why don' t you move your hands?
Because I don' t want to.
I don' t want you.
Now, get out.
Get out.
I brought you some peas.
There are no statutes capable of controlling... the relations between men and women.
More conventional ways.
I expect that dress back, dry cleaned, in perfect condition.
I' m just going to leave you with this literature.
Why don' t you read about women' s struggle first?
You know, Lee,... there' s a long history of this in Catholicism.
And the nuns wore them sewn inside their clothing.
Two years ago when it didn' t work out between us, that was it.
I let him slip through my fingers.
- I admire you, Ms. Holloway.
Without question, he is the most isolated man I' ve ever known.
The worm... amazing.
Who' s to say that love needs to be soft and gentle?
'You are the child of God' s holy gift of life.
You come from me, but you are not me.
Your soul and your body are your own,... and yours to do with as you wish. '
Thank you, Daddy.
Drinks.
Don' t take anybody else' s drink.
We are here on day three of what has come to be known... as the 'Lee Holloway Hunger Strike.'
You may have heard... that there are those in the community who wonder... if Ms. Holloway is even willing to starve herself to death.
'In one way or another, I' ve always suffered.
I didn' t know why, exactly.
But I do know that I' m not so scared of suffering now.
I feeI more than I' ve ever felt,... and I' ve found someone to feel with, to play with, to love,... in a way that feels right for me.
I hope he knows that I can see that he suffers too,... and that I want to love him. '
Each cut, each scar, each burn, a different mood or time.
I told him where the second one came from.
I remembered them all.
And for the first time in my life, I felt beautiful.
Finally part of the earth.
I touched the soil and he loved me back.
Where did you go to high school?
What was your mother like?
What was her name?
What did it say... under your senior yearbook picture?
Who was your first Iove?
When did your heart... first get broken?
Where were you born?
Des Moines, Iowa.
All our activities melted into an everyday sort of life... until we looked like any other couple you' d see.
Pull it over, yes.
Just pull it tight.
Now these pillows like to be stacked...
largest to the smallest.
We had a June wedding, by ourselves, at the justice of the peace.
Then we honeymooned in the mountains.
We only had the weekend, because Edward had to get back to work.
The stage is full of wooden chairs and tables.
Two women come out with robes.
Their eyes are closed.
You get scared...
They trip on everything, poor them.
But suddenly, a man appears.
With a very sad face, the saddest I have ever seen.
You can' t imagine how touching it was.
Someone was sitting next to me.
I don' t understand why...
It was very beautiful!
I have a surprise for you!
I have an autograph of Rina Baus for you.
I had to buy the photo.
It is in english and says:
I hope you surpass all the obstacles...... and start dancing.
- She has her period.
- It' s early.
Good evening.
Benigno, can you stay tonight?
My sister can' t, and I don' t have anyone else.
Why did you come?
You should have called.
I am not taking advantage of you.
This week you did 3 nights.
Don' t worry.
A free afternoon is enough for me.
It' s a mess.
And to frame a photo.
My condition is not improving.
The hospital will decide.
Your husband left you and the children.
We will be ok.
Thanks a lot.
- You cut off the intestinal food.
- She couldn' t take it.
- We will try again tomorrow.
- Yes, go now.
And keep the spirits up!
Six bulls and a woman.
Lydia P. Gonzales will fight six bulls.
Why such a drastic decision?
2 bulls, or 6.
Whatever they say.
People say a lot of bullfighters won' t fight with you...... because you are a woman.
People can say what they want.
Too much chauvinism in bullfighting, but there are exceptions.
Nino Valencia was happy to share billing with you for several months.
Do you think he did it to promote himself?
And when he succeeded that, he abandoned you?
I told you, I don' t want to talk about this!
But by talking about certain problems...... is the first step towards their solution.
- Enough!
My dear Lydia, let me finish the question.
I told you earlier.
They will think it' s a fixed interview.
And I am on of the few who dare say the truth...... and you should dare accept... that Nino Valencia took advantage of you.
He shared with you not only the fame, but sex as well.
And he left you when time was right.
Juan Luis, Marco here...
How are you?
I want to ask you something.
I would like to do an article about Lydia Gonzales.
Yes, I see it too...
I would like to do something deep.
Great...
- She dedicates it to you.
She would let the bull injure her, just so that you see it.
You shouldn' t have come, especially you.
Don' t tell me anything.
Nino should concentrate.
Nothing to worry about.
He should just come to pick up his stuff.
- Or tell me where to send them.
- Send them at my place.
He, himself, should say so.
This has nothing to do with you.
You can leave whenever you want.
- Good evening.
- Scotch on the rocks, please.
- What glass do you prefer?
- A tall one.
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?
When something is over, it' s over.
- What are you saying?
- Can I talk to you?
If you take me to Madrid, we can talk on the way.
It will be my pleasure.
- Who named you Lydia?
- My father.
It' s as if he sealed your destiny.
He always wanted to be a bullfighter, but stayed a banderillero.
He is the one that was there for me, more than anyone else.
I am sorry.
'El Pais' wants me to do a profile on you for their Sunday issue.
Do you write on bullfighting?
I don' t know your name.
To be honest, I know nothing of it.
But I know a lot about desperate women.
And who told you I am desperate?
- This is the impression I have.
- Bullfighting doesn' t interest you.
You are interested in my relationship with Nino Valencia.
Tell El Pais to leave me alone!
- What' s going on?
Take me from here!
There is a snake in the kitchen.
- Give me the keys.
- The door is open.
Calm down.
And stay there.
My purse.
Take me to a hotel.
I am never coming back to this house.
- To which hotel?
- To Eurobuilding, lets say.
Don' t tell anyone about the snake, please.
Only my family knows.
I always respect other people' s phobias.
After what you have done, how can I say no to the profile?
Think about it again.
I will call tomorrow, tell me then.
Thanks for everything.
Do you want me to stay?
I can sleep on the sofa.
No, I need to get used to being alone.
Do you wash her?
What do you think?
- How was the night? - normal.
- Give it to me.
- I am going now.
- Good bye.
- Bye, Matilde.
It' s so hot!
- Lets cut her hair. - short, it' s more practical.
We will leave it as it was when she came here...... so that she is not surprised when she wakes up.
After 4 years, it will be great.
I believe in miracles.
So should you.
- Why me?
- Because you need them.
One might happen to you, and you will not know.
So hot!
I took something from the drugstore...... to help stop the perspiration stains on my uniform.
- Perspirex.
It' s Marco...
Remember me?
- How are you?
- Naked.
That' s all I' ve got.
I can bring you some from your place.
Maybe another time.
- Where are we going?
- To Sybilla.
- Why?
- Because I don' t want to go home.
- No, I understand.
When I separated, I couldn' t sleep in the same bed...
I was sleeping on the sofa, in the living room.
For a week.
Until I finally bought a new bed.
So, you are separated.
I am alone.
Marco, we should talk afterwards.
- We' ve been talking for an hour.
- You have, not me.
Indeed.
Did you read about the nuns that got raped by the missionaries?
Priests, themselves!
Where are we heading to?
First they raped the locals.
Then, due to AlDS, they started raping nuns.
And I admired them so much!
Not all of them are rapists, for sure.
No, some of them are pedophiles.
- What' s that?
- Antonio, you are an animal!
- How do the bulls look?
- Good, but fat.
- How much do you think?
- Over 500 kilos.
I am going to the bar.
And don' t forget, we are eating home.
If the kids don' t see their aunt, there' il be hell to pay.
Don' t cry, my love.
- How is it?
- Very bad.
It tore her apart.
The father will be happy now!
'Not the little one!', we kept telling him, my mother and I.
Don' t be upset.
What time is it?
It has been four hours.
Yes...
I would like to stay, but I can' t.
We can' t do anything extra.
The bar' s been closed for 20 days.
The kids are with the neigbhour, and I' ve neglected the other one.
If something happens, can you be here in 2 hours?
- Rest assured for that.
- We have to have faith.
I light some candles...... but I find it very difficult to have faith.
When can we put her medals back on her?
Not yet.
With all these... wounds, the tracheotomy...
She never took them off.
I will get a vase.
I have to go to the US for three months.
It is very important, says my agent.
And yet... the way things stand here...... I don' t want to go.
Can you get out for a moment, please?
No smoking here.
Did she talk to you that day?
- And what did you say?
Things that concern me.
Did she tell you anything about me?
Honestly, Lydia hadn' t talked about you for a long time.
- It' s my fault for what happened.
- No, it' s my fault.
Caetano made me freak out.
Marco, I' ve always wanted to ask you something.
Why did you cry that night, after you killed the snake?
It brought me lots of memories.
Years ago, I had to kill another snake.
We were in Africa.
She had the same phobia as you.
She was waiting outside the tent, terrified, defenseless...... and totally naked...... because she had seen the snake, while we were asleep.
Was it the same one who made you sleep in the living room?
I hate that woman.
- I haven' t seen her for years.
- Even worse.
What can I do to make you forget her?
Exactly what you are doing now.
We didn' t want to wake you up.
- Is Dr Vega here?
- He is in his office.
Rosa, close the door.
There' s a draft.
- She opened her eyes.
- That gives me the creeps!
- And when she yawns?
- I shit myself!
Good morning, doctor.
I want to talk to you.
How are you?
Did you sleep well?
I will buy you coffee.
How long for might Lydia stay like that?
Months... years... maybe for the rest of her life...
There is no hope?
However...
RESUSClTATlON
Meryl Moon wakes up after 15 years in a coma.
She went into a coma during childbirth.
Meryl was a PVS, persistent vegetative state, like Lydia, for life.
Her recovery contradicts everything I am about to say.
That is, that there is hope.
Scientifically, no.
But if you want to have faith, OK.
Or I imagine this?
She does, but that doesn' t mean she is aware of anything.
Her brain cell has been completely destroyed.
However, it can control the automatic functions... such as breathing, sleeping, waking up and intestinal functions.
She opens her eyes, but mechanically.
She has no ideas and feelings.
Come in, please.
- My name is Benigno.
- Marco Zuloaga
This is Alicia.
Was it your first night here?
The first one is the worst.
Then you get used to it.
Why these boots?
They prevent her feet from twisting or falling.
- They look like 'Ibiza' boots.
- I' ve never been to Ibiza.
- I know you.
- From my books?
It was in Cafe Muller...
We happened to be sitting together.
And at some stage, you started crying.
He cried watching "Cafe Muller".
I have to go.
That fast?
We barely talked.
- Maybe another time.
Come to see us.
I am always here, even during the night.
I am a 'veteran' here.
If you need something...
- Should I call Dr Vega?
- Carry on with what you are doing.
The other day, while browsing my notes...... I found some from your visit.
I wrote a topic to be discussed during the second visit...... that never took place.
- What about?
- Your sexual orientation.
- My sexual orientation? - yes, your sexuality.
Whether you like men or women.
During your visit, you said you were still a virgin.
Answering your question somehow...... I think I look for men, mostly.
- I can' t remember now.
I guess that' s it...
But I am very well now.
Do you have a partner?
More or less.
I am not alone anymore.
I don' t have a problem.
I hope you were not offended by my question.
Was her father here?
He asked me if I am a fag.
He used an american expression, more subtle.
- What is my orientation?
- And what did you say?
- That I like men.
- Really?
No, you fool.
I lied.
How can he dare ask whether I like men or women?
- I am glad I found out.
Did he ask the head nurseor you if you like bestiality or coprophagy?
No, you are right.
They don' t ask such things.
I might go on a trip, and I won' t be able to come and see you.
But, in Geneva, they' ve offered me a creation...... a chorography that thrills me.
I call it 'Trenches'.
It is about the first world war.
I will need a lot of dancers...... because in the war there are a lot of soldiers.
But everyone dances in Geneva.
It is great.
I want female dancers too, because the soldier when dying...... lets his soul get out of his body...... the ghost of which will be a female dancer.
With a white classic skirt like 'Giselle'...... but with red stains of blood.
Very good!
Alicia loved it.
It' s good because life emerges out of death. the female emerges from the male.
And from the earthly emerges the...
The beach?
And from the earthly emerges the...
The water?
The ethereal.
The ethereal... the impreceptible, the ghost.
I have the music.
It is from Kristof Penderesky.
It was written for the victims of Hiroshima, but it' s OK.
Of course.
Alicia remembers it perfectly well.
It' s music for the battle.
It' s wild and beastly.
And regarding the music during deaths I have a masterpiece...... which you will listen to, right now.
It will drive you crazy.
Alicia, my dear.
Good bye, my dear.
Good bye, Katerina.
And you look beautiful.
- You should go ahead with 'Trenches'.
- I will.
Look...
We will place you next to the window.
You will be able to see your friends dancing.
I love this room.
I will order everything.
Come in and shut the door...
How are you?...
Sit down.
Alicia, look who' s here.
We' re just getting some air, reading magazines...
Who was the lady that just left?
Katerina, Alicia' s teacher.
Dancing teacher.
Nice character, Katerina.
Alicia was her student.
And Katerina loves her like her daughter.
Benigno, You are by the window for half an hour.
I am coming, mum.
Are you following me?
This is yours, I think.
You must have dropped it.
is everything there?...
I didn' t touch anything...
- Where are you going?
- Home.
Can I accompany you?
I have nothing else to do.
- Yes, but I am going home.
- Of course...
It will do me good.
Dancing is my life.
- Do you like dancing?
- Yes, of course
But I don' t follow it.
What else do you do, besides dancing?
I travel and watch old movies.
Silent Cinema is attractive to me, in particular.
- Where do you go when you go out?
- I don' t.
You should go out.
I was taking care of my mother, but she passed away 2 months ago.
I am sorry.
Mine died too, years ago though.
Here we are...
Thanks for the wallet.
7th left.
Twenty three.
I was waiting for her by the window, but that day she didn' t come.
But I knew her address and that her father was a psychiatrist.
Dr Roncero' s office.
I would like to make an appointment.
- Is it tomorrow at 5 OK?
- Isn' t earlier possible?
No, tomorrow at 5.
Your name?
- What do you want?
- I have an appointment at 5.
Don' t stand there.
Benigno Martin?...
I need some proof.
I just wanted to see Alicia, but I was there, in a psychiatrist.
I decided to tell him I missed my mother.
I started when I was little.
And all those 15 years you took care of your mother?
I was always next to her...
I was only going out to the classes.
I was also studying aesthetics, make- up and hairdressing.
But those by post.
So you did those on your mother?
Of course, and I cut her hair, dyed it, did her nails.
And I scrubbed her down well, front and back.
My mother wasn' t disabled, or mad.
She was only a bit lazy.
She was a beautiful woman and I didn' t want to let herself go.
- What did your father say?
- Nothing.
What could he?
- Is he dead?
- God, no.
He is in Sweden, I guess.
I haven' t heard of him for years.
Doesn' t he come to see you?
He has his own family there, after he left my mother.
We are not in touch.
Why did you come to see me, Benigno?
- Me?
Nothing.
You must have since you came to see a psychiatrist.
Loneliness, I guess.
Did you have a sexual relationship with a woman?
- With a man?
- No, neither.
I will see you in a week.
- Am I not well doctor?
- That' s not it...
However, your adolescence was kind of special.
- It was.
Very special.
And we must analyse it in depth.
Yes, lets analyse it.
- Very well.
I am glad.
- What are you doing here?
- I was just going.
Don' t be angry.
I just wanted to see you...
But I am harmless.
Dr Roncero' s office...
Hi, Lola...
I just had a shit of huge dimensions.
Can you be in charge?
Alicia never came back.
I didn' t want to scare her again.
After a week I went to her place, to see her father.
It was raining during that whole week.
Next time I saw her was here.
What happened to her?
A car accident, during a rainy day.
Her father didn' t want her to be alone, not even for a moment.
He asked for the best nurses.
And I have a good reputation here...
And when he saw me, he remembered me, and hesitated for a moment.
But in the end, he took Matilde and me, exclusively.
And this was four years ago...
And here we are now...
Right, Alicia?
I started going to the ballet, when I had a day- off.
And to the film library to watch silent movies.
German, american, italian films, everything.
And afterwards I would tell her about all that she had seen.
The four most complete years of my life.
I take care of Alicia...
I do what she would, except the trips, of course.
With me and Lydia it' s the opposite.
I can' t touch her.
I don' t recognize her body.
Neither can I help the nurses turn her around.
And I feel I am lousy.
Talk to her.
Tell her that.
I would like to, but she can' t hear me.
How are you so certain about this?
Her brain is dead, Benigno.
The woman' s mind is a mystery, especially in such sickness.
You must look after the woman, talk to her...... don' t foget that she' s alive and that you love her.
This is the only therapy.
I know from experience.
And what do you know about women?
Benigno, what do you know about women?
A lot.
20 years next to one, 4 with another.
I like the bullfighter' s boyfriend.
He has style.
How do you know?
You saw him?
Of course not, but I can tell from his face.
And his bulging trousers.
He is a good friend of Benigno, right?
- No way.
What are you saying now?
- Is Benigno, you think?
- Rumours say so!
- You are wrong.
- Dr Vega told me so as well.
- From Alicia' s father.
I don' t like the intimacy he has with the patient...... but Vega told me not to worry, becayse he is gay.
I am going and I' il let you carry on talking crap about him.
- She likes Benigno.
- She is not with her senses.
I have the day off.
I am going to the film library.
- Are you coming?
- I will see my publisher tonight.
I have to go back to work soon.
This woman is not well.
You know what I mean.
Her skin is dry.
lets see...
Here...
- Did you talk to her?
- No, and don' t insist.
Hi, Lydia.
You must be patient with him.
Have a good time at work.
'Shrinked lover'.
Rosa has the flu.
I hope you didn' t get it from her.
I am glad you feel well, but I will massage you...... and I will rub you with a rosemary lotion.
No, nothing is happening to me.
Last night I saw a movie that shook me a lot.
It was the love story...... of Alfredo, a nice young guy, but a bit fat...... kai Amparo' s friend who is a scientist.
What egoism!
Time was passing by...... but Amparo couldn' t find the antidote...... and poor Alfredo, day by day, shrank in misery.
So that Amparo doesn' t suffer...... Alfredo leaves and goes to find his mother.
He hadn' t seen her for 10 years, beacause he was lousy.
He hadn' t told Ambaro where his mother lived.
Lots of things going on in this movie.
But the most important thing is...... after years full of regrets and studies...... Amparo finds the address of his mother.
And goes there.
And Alfredo...... stays inside her...... for ever.
Come on, put your hands correctly...
This way...
It' s great...
It' s nice here by the balcony, right?
Lydia likes to sit by the balcony as well.
She likes it a lot.
Look at them...
It' s as if they are talking about us.
What do you think they say?
They have no shame.
Women talk about everything with each other.
Lydia would tell her she has completed two months sick.
Benjamin and Angela...... will you bond in marriage, with your own will?
Join your hands together...... and declare your wish in front of God.
I, Angela, take you, Benjamin...... to be my lawful husband...
I will love you in happiness and in sickness...... so long as we shall both live.
The Lord that joined you in love...... let him accept your declaration of love today.
May your love last eternally.
What are you doing here?
We were gonna meet at the hotel.
I changed my mind.
I' ve always liked weddings.
Weren' t you gonna see your sister before the game?
She will come to the hotel.
I promised her we will eat at the restaurant tonight.
As you wish.
- Nice ceremony, right?
- Excellent.
- I didn' t expect her so young.
- You don' t trust me right?
We can' t have another day passing by without talking.
Don' t worry.
Finish with Angela, I have proof.
For example, at the ceremony I didn' t cry, you did.
- Right.
- And you shouldn' t have.
Don' t you believe me?
I needed 10 years to get over it.
I finally made it.
Lydia, trust me, it' s over.
The excuse was to write a travel guide.
In reality, I wanted her out of Madrid and drugs.
Our relationship functioned outside it.
After five trips, I brought her to her parents...... who kept her away from drugs and from me.
Did you still love her?
I cried not being able to share things with her.
It' s terrible to leave a person you love so much.
What a sad story!
Love is a sad thing when it ends...... as the song says.
Marco, we need to talk afterwards.
- We' ve been talking for an hour.
- You have, not me.
You' re right.
But you know what?
Now I can stay with you until you wake up.
No one will take me away from you.
We got back together, a month ago...
It was you she cried for.
She called me to tell me she cried for me.
Last time we spoke.
Now that I don' t fight due to injury...... I would like to stay near her during the night.
Like at your place.
I am alone again.
You were looking at her breasts.
They grow by the day.
Benigno, I am thinking of taking a trip...
I have to work.
And Lydia?
She doesn' t need me anymore.
Did you break up?
You can call it that way.
I expected this, Marco.
Don' t ask why, I just did.
There was something in your relationship that didn' t function right.
When are you going?
Soon, but I' il see you before I go.
I am so sorry you are going.
I am leaving, Benigno.
I' il see you soon.
She didn' t have her period yet?
I am looking at the month' s report.
Yes, it' s a bit late.
That' s a lot.
Are you sure she had it last month?
I personally dealt with it.
It was when you had the flu.
She seems a bit swollen.
They often have abnormalities.
For example, Lydia doesn' t have a period anymore.
Anyway, we should tell Dr Vega.
I brought some of my guides for Alicia and you.
I said goodbye to Lydia.
Is there something wrong?
Just some infection that Alicia got.
Can you drive me home?
I am done with work.
- It' s not serious, I hope.
- I don' t know.
They do some medical exams, but they haven' t told me anything.
Brazil...... Turkey, Cuba.
- I will read them to Alicia.
- They are guides.
They must be good.
- Are you travelling alone?
I would like to talk to you about this before you go.
- About what?
- loneliness.
I want to get married.
- Alicia, of course!
- Benigno, you are nuts!
We will get along better than most couples.
- Why shouldn' t I marry her?
- Because she is in a coma!
Because she can' t say 'yes' in the church!
Because, she is virtually dead!
Get in the car!
- What are you talking about?
- Get in the car!
Your relationship with Alicia is a crazy monologue!
We often talk to PVS, but we don' t marry them.
Incredible what you are saying.
I had a different opinion of you.
Don' t say or think about it ever again!
Promise!...
If you say that to anyone else, you will be in trouble!
If that calms you down, then I promise.
- Regardless of how much you like her...
- You like her too, right?
Of course I like her.
- She likes you too.
- She is virtually dead!
She has no feelings about me, you, or herself!
Understand that!
Our patient Alicia Roncero was raped and is pregnant.
Before I tell her father I want you to tell me...... which bastard did it!
Everyone is upset.
You are responsible.
Alicia was on your floor.
Then allow me to explain the situation.
Rosa, please.
Alicia' s period stopped two months ago.
I thought it was one month initially, but I was wrong.
It wasn' t in last month' s report.
It says it was dealt with normally.
I was down with flu during that week.
Right, Benigno?
- It is your typewriting.
- Yes, it was me.
Why did you lie?
I didn' t want it to become a problem.
On other occasions, the patients' periods have also stopped.
How come no one noticed?
Where is the night person?
She can' t come today.
Didn' t see notice anything strange?
She has problems at home.
A lot of nights she doesn' t come.
And who replaces her?
I will tell Roncero that his daughter...... is day and night with a nutter?
Lets calm down for a bit.
Benigno, do you realise you are the prime suspect?
Why did you hide the first delay?
What explanation do you have?
Would you ever harm Alicia?
Definitely not!
Last night I was at the parkin lot...... and overheard a discussion between Benigno and Marco.
Benigno said he wanted to marry Alicia.
Marco tried to change his mind, but in vain.
Lots of couples, he said...... don' t get along as well as him and Alicia.
It was Lydia Gonzales' funeral yesterday, at Almudena.
The thirty- year old bullfighter was in a coma since...
Can I speak with Benigno Martin?
He doesn' t work here anymore.
- Are you sure?
- And sister Rosa Lazaga?
- Who are you?
- Marco Zuloaga.
- I will put you through.
- Who is it?
- Marco Zuloaga.
I am calling from Jordan.
I found out about Lydia.
I am sorry, Marco.
You should have called me.
We had a lot of problems here.
Benigno isn' t there anymore, I was told.
Benigno is in jail.
He is accused of raping Alicia.
Help him.
He has no one the poor guy.
Did you go see him?
After what he did, I can' t.
However he does need help, and you are his friend.
- What prison is he in?
- In Zegovia.
Wait for me here.
- I want to see a prisoner.
Through this door, on the left.
I want prisoner Benigno Martin.
It isn' t a visting day, but I will see whether...
I am sorry, I can' t hear you.
It isn' t a visiting day.
And the lodger didn' t ask for a visit.
He doesn' t know I am in Madrid.
I came today.
- Are you a relative?
- A friend.
- Marco Zuloaga is my name.
- Can I see your I. D.?
- Can I call him?
- He will call you.
I have changed number.
Can you give him the new one?
And remember.
But the lodger should ask for the visit.
If he doesn' t want to see you, there is nothing we can do.
And something else.
We don' t have prisoners here...
We don' t have prisoners here, we have lodgers.
Marco, is that you?
I am glad to hear your voice.
I asked your visit on Saturday.
- Where are you?
- Outside the clinique.
Dr Vega told me everything.
How could you do it?
Did you come back to Spain to get on my back?
What should I bring you on Saturday?
I need information.
They wouldn' t say anything from the clinique.
She is in a different one.
- I don' t believe this.
- Neither do I.
But I am not surpised they won' t tell us.
- Are you still my friend?
Since I am here.
Then find out about Alicia.
Whether she' s alive, whether she gave birth, whether the baby is alive...
I need to know, Marco...
You understand, right?
I will try to...
Talk to you on Saturday...
- Did you find out anything?
- I will.
Be patient.
I was, until the day she would give birth.
One month ago.
You must wait.
- What do you do during the day here?
- I work in the recovery room.
It' s a new prison, few people.
It' s quiet in here.
- It doesn' t look like a prison from outside.
- The problem is elsewhere!
That I don' t see Alicia.
The doctor ki o Dr Roncero say I am a psychopath.
This is good for the trail, they say, but I don' t care about the trial.
I need to see Alicia, to find out how everything went.
If this goes on, I don' t know what I am capable of doing!
Then I will act like one!
Don' t say that, Benigno!
And find me another lawyer.
The one I have despises me.
I will rent my place so that I can pay him.
I am currently homeless.
Great.
I am glad you will be my tenant.
I was thinking about you a lot, especially during the nights.
- Why during the nights?
- Because I study during the nights.
I read all your guides.
Like travelling with you next to me...... telling me things.
I liked Avan' s the most.
I became one with those people...... that have nothing and invent everything.
And you describing the Cuban girl...... in front of her window by the sea...... waiting in vain...... for something that will never happen.
I was thinking that woman is me.
Good morning.
I am Benigno' s friend.
You are Marco, the Argentinian?
Benigno called me.
Will you take his appartment?
It will be dirty.
He wouldn' t let me in to clean it.
- And I didn' t want any money...
- It' s OK, I will take care of it.
Shall I give you the key?...
I will go look for it...
Did you see him?
- How is he?
- Well.
Poor guy, he wasn' t even lucky during his imprisonment.
No publicity!
No TV, no reporters.
No one came here.
They didn' t condescend!
I would give them an interview!
The media is shit in this country!
You are right.
The keys...
Anyway...
Do you know why Benigno is in prison?
He is very quiet.
He didn' t say a word last time he came.
- Benigno is innocent.
- Yes, I know.
- Innocent about what?
- I don' t know.
You do, but you don' t want to tell me.
If you need something, you know where I am.
I was glad you stepped in by yourself today, without crutches.
- How did the exercise go today?
- Very well.
- Were you tired?
It doesn' t matter.
We will do some extra exercises.
We will do some stretches.
- But I already did 100.
- We' il do a few more.
I have an appointment with Mr. Sainz.
The boy was born dead.
Alicia recovered.
Benigno hasn' t found out.
In his condition, he could do something crazy.
I can' t lie to him.
He is my only friend.
I will tell him.
I have no problem.
Alicia is still in coma and the baby dead, I will say.
But you don' t tell him anything.
- Can he bail out?
- Very difficult, and expensive.
- You are wet.
- A little.
Be careful not to catch a cold.
Drink hot milk with honey.
Since I am here, I like rainy days.
Dld you see the new lawyer?
He was here... he told me everything...
- I will loose, right?
- Frankly, yes, you will.
At least nothing happened to Alicia during birth.
It' s the only thing that consoles me and gives me hope.
Are you ok, Benigno?
I would like to hug you so much, Marco.
But I have to ask for a meeting face to face.
I tried.
They asked me whether you are my lover.
I didn' t dare say 'yes' since that would annoy you.
It wouldn' t annoy me at all.
You can say whatever you want.
I have hugged very few people in my life.
Message!
I was very happy to see you and say goodbye today.
They won' t let me get out of here...... or they will put me somewhere else
I don' t want to live without Alicia...... without being able to hold not one pin of hers.
Therefore I will escape.
I didn' t tell you so that you won' t stop me.
I hug you firmly, Marco.
In Zegovia...
Yes, in prison...
I urgently need to see Benigno Martin.
It' s a matter of life and death.
Where is his office?
The guard will accompany you.
Empty your pockets, please.
Wait, don' t run.
In there at the end.
Good morning.
I am Marco Zuloaga.
Benigno Martin left this letter for you.
Dear Marco...
It' s still raining, and this is a good sign.
When Alicia had the accident, it was raining too.
I am writing to you a few minutes before I escape.
I hope, with all these, to fall in a coma as well...... and to be near her.
You are my only friend.
I am leaving you the house I prepared for me and her.
Wherever they take me, come to see me and talk to me.
Tell me everything, without hiding anything.
Goodbye, my friend.
I took these from him and these I found at his cell.
You must sign here.
Benigno, it' s me.
Alicia is alive...
You woke her up.
I got your message and ran immediately to tell you...... but it was too late.
I put a pin of Alicia in your pocket.
And a photo of your mother.
So that they can be with you in eternity.
Like wild waves.
The male on top, the female below.
I will bring some water.
Are you ok?
I don' t know...
I am much better now.
Come on, lets go inside.
You tremble.
Why?
- What did you tell her?
- Noting.
I saw you talking.
She asked if I am ok, and I thanked her.
You will see me around.
I live near the dancing school.
In Benigno' s place?
- Why do you stay there?
- Benigno is dead.
One day, we should talk.
Yes, and it will be simpler than you thought.
Nothing is simple.
I am a dancing teacher, and nothing is simple. and nothing is simple.
25. 000
I don' t know.
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Morgan!
Bo, wher e' s Morgan?
Ar e you in my dr eam, too?
-- This is not a dr -- -- Dad!
What' s happening?
The dogs wer e barking -- woke us up.
Ar e you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
Look, Lee, I don' t even car e if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that' d be enough f or me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids wer e conf used by it, and, uh, it' d sur e take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that' s all.
At the movies?
Ar e you sur e?
Uh, thanks f or your patience, Lee.
Houdini peed.
I think he' s sick.
Why don' t you take him outside?
I' il call Dr. Crawf ord.
He doesn' t tr eat animals.
Well, he' il know what to do.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you f olks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving f or her lif e when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
Spitting!
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I' m telling you, I won' t eat f or a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad' s gonna burn these again.
It' s contaminated.
You don' t even know what that word means.
It' s not contaminated.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes f unny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don' t think he' il mind.
Bo, don' t run.
What' s wrong, boy?
Stop it, Houdini.
Look at wher e it' s bent over, Father.
It' s not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without br eaking it?
It' s too perf ect.
It doesn' t sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can' t take a piss without wetting the f ront of their pants.
I don' t think anyone else around her e has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry' s f arm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why wer e you at Theo' s place?
Some animals around the county have been acting f unny -- and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don' t think so, Father.
They' r e mor e edgy, you know, and alert.
It' s almost like they act when they smell a pr edator around -- peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father."
What' s wrong?
I don' t hear my childr en.
He f ell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
I' m so sorry, Morgan.
Wher e wer e you?
Houdini' s sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sur e the knot' s very tight.
What' s the matter?
Ther e' s a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What' s wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What ar e you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you' r e by yourself?
Makes me f eel better.
Does she ever answer back?
She never answers me either.
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers ar e back.
It' s time f or an arse- whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a f riend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we' il be doing Lee a f avour.
Alright, listen -- we both go outside, move around the house in opposite dir ections.
We act crazy, insane with anger -- make them crap in their pants, f orce them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
It' s just f or show.
Well, it won' t be convincing.
It doesn' t sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
Ar e you gonna do this or what?
Alright, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
-- 1...
I' m insane with anger!
We' r e gonna beat your arse, bitch!
We' r e gonna tear your head off!
I' m losing my mind!
It' s time f or an arse- whupping!
I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get...
Ar e you sur e this is Lionel Prichard?
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
-- You can?
It only works one way, but that' il do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie- talkie left over at the station.
Doy- da!
You' r e too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what' s wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amoebas in it.
So, how ar e you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but l- I thought your moving in her e with your brother after -- it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don' t think I' m helping much.
You ar e.
Okay, so f ar I have, "It was very dark."
You can' t describe him at all?
Don' t you think that' s kind of odd?
A little.
I don' t know whether to look f or a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn' t a midget.
So he was tall?
l- I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 f eet?
Yes, it was.
How certain ar e you that this was a male?
Oh, I don' t know -- I don' t know any girls who could run like that.
I don' t know, Merrill.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O- Our roof is 10 f eet high.
They have women' s high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you' r e making a point her e, but I just don' t know what it is.
An out- of- town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn' t have her f avourite cigar ettes at the vending machine.
She scar ed a couple of the customers.
No one' s seen her since.
And my point is, we don' t know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
I don' t know, baby.
Why don' t you check in the sof a cushions?
Ex cluding the possibility that a f emale Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I' m not done asking questions, and I don' t appr eciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you -- maybe a- a church member who -- who might not have liked the f act that you left the church?
I don' t think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole f emale - Scandinavian- Olympian thing.
It' s just, I' m pr etty strong, and I' m pr etty f ast.
And I was running as f ast as I could, and this guy, he was -- he was just toying with us.
Ther e' s only f ood under the sof a.
Baby, why don' t you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
Same show' s on every station.
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with r enewed inter est in extraterr estrial lif e.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoax es.
This new r esurgence is wholly diff er ent.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appear ed implies the coordination of hundr eds of individuals over many countries.
Ther e ar e only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoax es ever cr eated, or basically... it' s f or r eal.
Extraterr estrials.
What in God' s name is going on?
I did some r esearch after I saw your crops.
Two or thr ee guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
That' s how these things have been done in the past.
But ther e ar e so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can' t think straight.
I' m -- I' m gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar' s coff ee and -- and try to think clear.
I might make some calls.
But I' il tell you something -- what I said in ther e, it still goes.
Your -- your f amily has been through a lot.
And the last thing these childr en need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That' s good advice.
And you take car e of yourself...
Graham.
The f ootage you' r e watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34- year- old local cameraman in Bangalor e, a southern city of India.
It' s the 18th r eported crop sign f ound in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They ar e signs intended to be seen f rom the sky --
No radio either.
Just f or a while.
Book money?
Just one.
Be back f or pizza in 15.
It' s just a bunch of crock.
They' r e trying to sell sodas.
It' s plain and simple.
Been watching these r eports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so f ar -- 12!
You have any books on extraterr estrials?
Now, don' t tell me you believe this horse manur e.
As a matter of f act, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment -- decided to keep it f or the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These ar e just copycats.
Someone somewher e does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
And it' s not "Father" anymor e.
In less than an hour, a couple hundr ed people get the same brilliant idea, and her e we ar e, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a f avour, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey... I am not a r ever end anymor e.
I haven' t been f or six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV -- two girls came in her e talking about the end of the world --
I' m just a little scar ed.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I' ve got it figur ed.
I' ve had two separate f olks tell me ther e have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
Can' t tell what they look like
'cause they' r e staying in the shadows -- covertlike.
Nobody' s been hurt, mind you.
And that' s the giveaway.
I see.
It' s called "probing."
It' s a military procedur e.
You send out a r econnaissance group -- very small -- to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation -- evaluate the level of danger, make sur e things ar e all clear.
Clear f or what?
For the r est of them.
You got a pamphlet or something I can r ead?
You didn' t used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You' r e Merrill Hess.
I was ther e the day you hit that 507- f ooter over the left- field wall -- set the r ecord.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It' s still the r ecord, right?
Got the bat at home o- on the wall.
You' ve got two minor- league home- run r ecords, don' t ya?
Five.
Why wer en' t you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautif ul women?
'Cause he has another r ecord most people don' t know about.
He has the minor- league strikeout r ecord.
Merrill' s a class- A scr ew- up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tr ee.
Merrill her e has mor e strikeouts than any two players.
You r eally got the strikeout r ecord?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It' s contaminated.
Carl, ther e' s something wrong with our water.
Your water' s fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole lif e.
It' s like a tick people have, ex cept it' s not a tick.
Is that right?
13!
-- Pop, pop I wanna... Shasta -- I' il take it.
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly... "shits" and... "bastards."
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you' r e a douche bag f or kissing Barbara"?
It' s a curse.
Then it' s not 37.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don' t want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood?
Is that him?
Who is he?
What is it?
It' s Bo' s baby monitor.
I f ound it in the basement.
I' m gonna use it as a walkie- talkie.
What if it' s catching a signal f rom them?
But it wasn' t working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlf riend in their lives.
They' r e, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyse Gr eek mythology and make up secr et societies wher e other guys who never had girlf riends bef or e can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to f eel special.
It' s a scam.
Nerds wer e doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds ar e doing it again.
It' s just static, Morgan, alright.
See.
It' s a code.
Why can' t they get girlf riends?
Can I see that, please?
It' s noise.
It' s just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I' m getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
See, this is why we' r e not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
No, Dad!
You' il lose the signal.
Don' t let go.
It gets clear er the higher you hold it.
Bo, honey, I don' t want you climbing on the car.
Ther e' s two of them talking.
Isabel, you' r e gonna f eel very silly when this turns out to be all just make- believe.
You' r e wasting your time her e!
I' m not gonna r eport this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You' r e not going to get f amous!
Let' s turn on the TV.
It first appear ed 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U. S. officials have confirmed that these ar e not aircraft f rom either government' s air f orce.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 7 47 en route f rom Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts enter ed Mexico City air space.
They wer e not detected by radar by either country.
The nerds wer e right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet r ecital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world' s f utur e is on the TV right now.
We need to r ecord this so you can show your childr en this tape and say you wer e ther e.
For your childr en, Bo.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I' m using your tape.
You ar e seeing a live f eed f rom our affiliate down her e in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
It' s unbelievable.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people ar e probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That' s true.
Do you think it could be?
How can you say that?
That wasn' t the answer you wanted?
Couldn' t you pr etend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comf ort.
People br eak down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as mor e than luck, mor e than coincidence.
They see it as a sign -- evidence that ther e is someone up ther e watching out f or them.
Group number two sees it as just pur e luck, a happy turn of chance.
I' m sur e the people in group number two ar e looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn' t 50- 50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they f eel that whatever happens, they' r e on their own.
And that fills them with f ear.
Yeah, ther e ar e those people.
But ther e' s a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they' r e looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they f eel that whatever' s going to happen, ther e' il be someone ther e to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person ar e you?
Ar e you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way -- is it possible that ther e ar e no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I' m on the couch with Randa McKinney.
looking beautif ul, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her... and I r ealise I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sof a, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she thr ew up.
That would have scarr ed me f or lif e.
I may never have r ecover ed.
I' m a miracle man.
Those lights ar e a miracle.
Ther e you go.
So, which type ar e you?
Do you f eel comf orted?
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said bef or e they let her die.
She said, "See."
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away."
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain wer e firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
Ther e is no one watching out f or us, Merrill.
We ar e all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, ther e was an accident -- drunk driving, they wer en' t sur e --
Ray f ell asleep at the wheel.
-- Is he okay?
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She' s talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She' s not in an ambulance, Father.
For the kids' protection.
I f elt like they wer e getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing f urry, f urry rabbit or tea party or something.
What' s f urry, f urry rabbit?
It' s a game, isn' t it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And ther e' s been some inter esting developments.
What time is it?
11. 00 a. m.
They' r e gone, but they' r e not r eally gone.
We just can' t see them.
Early this morning, a bird flew into the ar ea wher e the lights wer e hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and f ell straight down.
They' ve been playing it all morning.
The f ootage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
His -- his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible- shield thing going, l- like an optical illusion.
They' r e still ther e, hovering.
Some people think ther e' s mor e of them now... all over the place, over us, even.
Ther e' s a theory about the c -- the crop circles.
They could be some kind of -- some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate -- makes sense.
So the aliens can' t r ead our minds.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they' r e probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, ther e was no use f or physical development.
It also says they' r e probably vegetarians because they would have r ealised the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted f or their belief s.
That means they' r e unemployed.
If you' r e gonna make f un of it, then f orget it.
This is serious.
I don' t know what got into me.
Ther e ar e pictur es.
-- Bimbu?
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said ther e ar e two r easons why extraterr estrials would visit us -- to make contact in the spirit of exploration and f urthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other r eason -- they' r e hostile.
They' ve used up all the r esources on their planet, and they' r e looking to harvest our planet next.
Looks a little like our house, doesn' t it?
Same windows.
That' s weird.
That' s enough f rom Dr. Bimbu f or now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some f ruit or something.
I' m going out f or a f ew minutes.
No one leaves this house -- no one.
Wher e you going?
Ray Reddy' s house.
Why?
I think he just called her e.
Why?
You have one of your f eelings again?
Is it bad?
I won' t let anything bad happen to you.
I don' t want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die?
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It' s been sitting next to the phone f or 6 months.
I panicked.
Thank you f or coming, Father.
You' r e welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I' ve never f allen asleep driving bef or e... never since.
Most of the ride home, ther e wasn' t a car in sight in either dir ection.
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment -- that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I' m scr ewed, right?
People who kill r ever ends' wives ar en' t exactly usher ed to the f ront of the line in Heaven.
Wh -- Wher e ar e you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such -- none of them ar e r eally near water.
I don' t think they like water.
Can' t be any worse than her e.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I' ve done to you.
I made you question your f aith.
I' m truly sorry f or what I' ve done to you and yours.
And don' t open my pantry, Father.
I f ound one of them in ther e and locked him in.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son' s 7th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bur eau ther e and sent to us via satellite just a f ew minutes ago.
All initial opinions ar e this is genuine.
What you' r e about to see may disturb you.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We alr eady took some of your f riends downtown in a paddy waggon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we' il give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don' t throw your lif e away, son.
That' s why we couldn' t see them that night.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they wer e hostile?
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics -- hand- to- hand combat.
They wouldn' t use our technology or fight an airborne battle
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that inf ormation?
What else did it say?
They said ther e ar e one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and ar e def eated and have to r eturn again with f ull f orces hundr eds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What' s two?
They win.
I' m sorry, what -- what book is this?
Is this r eally happening?
I heard a theory that, uh, they don' t like places near water.
Maybe we' d be saf e f rom them near a lake or something.
Sounds made- up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy' s house.
I can' t be sur e, but I got the distinct f eeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay her e, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overr eacting, but I' m willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we' il be together.
All those in f avour of the lake idea, raise your hand.
All those in f avour of home, raise your hand.
My vote counts as two.
You' r e cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I get two votes because I r epr esent two par ents her e.
We don' t know anything yet.
We' il be saf e her e anyway.
I don' t want to leave home.
This is wher e we lived with Mom.
That' s got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can' t change your vote.
All those in f avour of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3- 2.
We' r e going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
The inf ormation we' r e r eceiving comes f rom our affiliates across the world.
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
Ther e ar e lights in over 27 4 cities.
They think it' il be 400 within the hour.
They' r e appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were f or navigation.
They made a map.
They' r e gonna be within a mile of us.
They think these ar e staged immediately pr eceding an attack manoeuvr e.
I was wrong.
They' r e hostile.
It' s like "War of the Worlds."
Ground f orces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundr eds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I' m going to get back to the windows.
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don' t worry.
You won' t let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you wer e my dad.
What did you say?
Don' t you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
Ther e' s too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don' t have enough boards.
We' il board up the bedroom doors.
Wher e ar e we gonna sleep?
In the f amily room.
What about Isabel?
We' il tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I' il make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We' il just eat f ast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds gr eat.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
Fr ench toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we' r e talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I' m going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What' s the matter with everyone?
Eat.
Maybe we should say a prayer.
Why not?
We' r e not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad f eeling.
I had a dr eam.
We ar en' t saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That' s fine.
You let Mom die.
I am not wasting one mor e minute of my lif e on prayer.
Not one mor e minute.
Understood?
Now we ar e going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us f rom enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
Stop crying!
-- Don' t yell at her!
I' m gonna try some of everything.
It' s happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you wer e born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn' t even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes wer e so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she' s like an angel."
And they said, "We' ve never seen a baby so beautif ul."
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can' t smile.
You smiled.
Let' s go down now.
We f orgot Isabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They alr eady know we' r e her e.
Do you know what happened when you wer e born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room bef or e I even had time to see you.
They' r e on the roof.
While they wer e fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They' r e in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dr eamt about you her whole lif e.
Then she got f eeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just star ed at each other f or the longest time.
And then she said r eal soft,
You look just how I dr eamt. "
The attic door.
We f orgot our f oil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They' il r ead our minds.
You' r e scaring your sister.
I' m alr eady scar ed.
I' m looking!
They' il know our secr et thoughts.
I' m not r eady.
Got it!
Wher e' s Bo?
I' m okay.
What' s happening out ther e?
I can' t even imagine.
I hope they' r e doing better than we ar e.
We don' t even have helmets.
They' r e only making noises.
They' r e not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
From what?
The book says they' r e probably very good problem solvers.
They' il find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
Ther e' s a coal chute in her e.
I can f eel air.
Me too!
It' s getting stronger.
I' m close.
We don' t have his medicine.
Don' t be af raid, Morgan.
We' il slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Br eathe like me.
I dr eamt this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It' il pass.
Don' t do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
The f ear is f eeding him.
Don' t be af raid of what' s happening.
Believe it.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don' t have to be af raid.
It' s about to pass.
Don' t be af raid.
Feel my chest.
Br eathe with me.
The air is going in our lungs.
We' r e the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray' s truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tr ee, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean -- pinned?
The truck -- the truck has sever ed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won' t be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it' s alive when it shouldn' t be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn' t f eel much, and she' s -- she' s talking almost like normal, and we didn' t pull the truck out
'cause we -- we wanted you to come down her e and be with her as long as she' s awake.
And that won' t be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I' ve told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I' m gonna talk with my wif e?
People think they came her e to take over the planet.
That' s bull.
I don' t think that.
My f riend and I saw them.
I f ound a pack of light bulbs.
They dragged them away.
This is a raid.
They came her e f or us, to harvest us.
We' r e lucky as hell they' r e leaving her e.
They' r e leaving?
That' s what they' r e saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
He said they had poison gas... they secr ete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they' r e leaving.
They left r eal f ast this morning,
like something scar ed them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why ar e they going?
People must have figur ed out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn' t think we' d make it through the night, did you?
Listen... ther e' s things I can take and a couple things I can' t.
One of them I can' t take is when my older brother, who' s everything I want to be... starts losing f aith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don' t want to ever see your eyes like that again.
I' m serious.
He' s been like that f or a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our ar ea?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties ar e clear ed... but who knows f or sur e?
He' s not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now --
I know.
We' d have to be sur e bef or e we opened up that door, Graham.
It' s good enough f or me.
Me too.
Get the syringes' well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
The atmospher e her e is cautiously optimistic.
-- People ar e celebrating.
-- They' r e dancing.
-- Do you want to see it? -- we will be left with a lot of questions.
-- I see the same expr ession on every f ace.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Thr ee small cities ther e f ound a primitive method to def eat them.
We have no f urther details at this time.
Merrill, wait.
I was... just taking a walk bef or e dinner.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don' t f eel much.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He' il always take car e of her.
And tell Graham --
I' m her e.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person ar e you?
Ar e you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible... ther e ar e no coincidences?
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
That' s why he had asthma.
His lungs wer e closed.
His lungs wer e closed.
No poison got in.
Give him a minute.
Don' t touch him.
What happened?
Did someone save me?
How' s that for a picture?
- It' s fabulous.
Just like a postcard.
- Is that the view from the hotel?
- We had that aerial up there.
And those smelly old mattresses.
Ellen was completely out of it after three cocktails.
She was so smashed there!
- She was so pissed there!
- He' s making me out to be a drunk.
I don' t find that funny.
They had 32 cocktails!
Could you please take that awful slide off now?
It' s embarrassing.
If I worked in television I' d use it as the test card.
That' s how he sharpens his beak.
Careful!
Stop it, you two.
- Carry on.
- Oh, all right.
Looks like someone shit in the sea.
That reminds me of my childhood at the lake.
I' m swimming along and see a floating turd.
When I came up I had a pile of shit on my head.
- Sleep well.
- Bye.
- Close the window, it' s cold.
- I' il drive.
- I' il drive.
- No, I' il drive.
- You' ve had too much.
- I can drive.
- Katrin!
- Yes?
- I' il call you to make a date.
I could pick you up or something.
Bye.
Wave goodbye.
Time for beddy- byes.
Yes.
- She can really get on your nerves.
- Yes, she' s unbearable at times.
- She never stops talking!
- I know.
- I think she' s unhappy with him.
- Oh, I don' t know.
- That was horrible of you.
- What?
Showing the picture.
- What picture?
- That awful one of me.
I was embarrassed.
- I thought...
I thought it was mean.
That was really rotten of you.
It wasn' t exactly flattering.
And then you leave...
What' s that in your hair?
Then you leave it on the screen for ages.
You know how I hate that.
Stop it now.
It' s embarrassing.
I mean, when we' re alone...
When we' re alone I don' t mind but not when we have guests over.
- There' s no need for that.
- Some of mine were terrible too.
- Did you see those?
- What do you want me to say?
I' ve found another shot.
- Down the hatch!
- I mean a slide.
Look at all the ash.
You' ve got to tip the ash inside.
Oh shit!
Shit, shit, shit!
It' s 5: 49 on Radio 24, playing hits of the last 24 years.
Broadcasting from the 24th floor of the Oder Tower.
This is Magic Chris.
Coming up, your personal horoscope.
Good morning!
This is Chris.
Good morning.
Mascha, Gregor!
Get a move on, it' s late.
Hurry up.
Get a move on.
We' re running late.
Bye, darling.
Bye, Gregor.
You be good now.
Hello.
No, this is Ellen speaking.
Ellen, really?
I wanted to remind Katrin to buy food because my daughter is coming today.
So she must have left her mobile there last night.
Morning.
So, everything ready?
Planning on tooting here all day?
Do you speak German?
Speak any German?
- Yes.
- You hanging around all day?
- Why not?
- Because I find it a bit irritating.
I' il come for something to eat.
Well, that' s good.
Maybe you could stand down there near the lamppost.
- Fine, but only because it' s you.
- I appreciate it.
I' il treat you to a beer later on.
I mean, I normally love music but...
Radio 24' s Magic Hour with your horoscope for today.
The stars favour change.
Put an abrupt end to all that boredom and try to spice up a dull day.
As you know, life is too short.
And this is to all Taureans.
Receive unexpected visitors with open arms.
Be sure to stock up your fridge.
Hi.
Come in.
- Sure?
- Yes.
- Got the phone.
- Sure.
- Hang on.
I' il only be ten seconds.
And that was Britney Spears.
Next up is the Happy Hour with Knut from the Tower.
A kiss from Chris.
- Quite a session last night.
- Indeed.
- There you go.
- That' s Katrin!
- I imagined this place to be bigger.
- It' s only a computer and a mixer.
It' s big enough.
Want to have a go?
Say something.
- Hello.
- Announce the time.
33.
- I think I' il leave that to you.
You have a fantastic view.
It' s even better from here.
You can see Poland, the stadium.
- You okay, Knut?
- You look and sound tired.
Knut, this is my girlfriend.
No, I mean this is...
This is...
- She' s my wife' s friend.
- Whatever.
Would you excuse me now?
- I have to go.
- So do I.
A nice evening, wasn' t it?
This thing takes ages.
Four.
I serve sausages, chips and schnitzel all day.
Soup is always popular.
Not surprising at 2 marks 50.
People like my soup.
Business is going well.
How long do you stay open?
Well, it depends.
I' m usually here till 10.
In the summer till 12.
Sometimes we stay open till 3.
I mean, if it' s someone' s birthday I' il be stuck here till 3.
I don' t mind though.
But it makes it difficult to spend time with the family.
You shouldn' t be filming this.
I' m not supposed to smoke in here.
If the health inspector turns up I' m in trouble.
I' il have to pay a 20 mark fine.
- 20 marks?
- Yes.
- Seriously?
- Yes, 20.
What happened, Uwe?
Oh shit, I don' t believe it.
That' s all I need.
- I' m sorry.
- We were supposed to meet.
- There' s not much time.
- We' re really busy.
- My break doesn' t last forever.
- All right!
- Look at how full this place is.
- I' m so thirsty!
- Eberhard?
- Yes?
- Got half an hour?
- Yes.
We' re buying a kitchen.
Hello.
- We want to look at some kitchens.
- Fine, go ahead.
Could you make a hamburger?
- It' s almost ready.
- Okay.
My break is almost over.
We have to hurry.
I' d like to know why we' re looking at kitchens anyway.
You always put a damper on things.
- You' ve seen our place.
- And our kitchen.
There' s no room for a proper kitchen.
There' s space even in the smallest place.
You always spoil it.
I' ve lost interest.
I see it as a living area.
A social area if you like.
In today' s houses kitchens tend to be bigger.
When I read this crap I' m glad they didn' t take me.
Can I take the car tomorrow?
No.
Did you drop something?
The glass from Aunt Trude.
Shit.
You married a klutz.
- Do you want some red wine?
- No.
That' il be Julia.
- So you decided...
- Hi.
Were you just going to bed?
Come in.
This is Jens.
This is my father.
Could you take your shoes off?
- That' s Katrin.
Jens.
I' ve got something for you.
A letter from mum.
- Who' s Jens?
- My boyfriend.
- I bought your cheese.
- You didn' t say he was coming.
I said I was coming so I figured...
- I didn' t think you' d mind.
Are we running a cheap hotel?
Who will she bring along tomorrow?
- So you' re Jens?
- Yes.
And what do you do?
That' s my dessert.
The dessert stays here.
I said the dessert stays.
Make yourself a sandwich.
Well, have a nice evening, Jens.
- What is it?
- Stressing about the dessert.
Jens.
We' il be seeing more of Jens.
Sleep well.
You too.
If you see a speed trap, call us.
0180242424.
This is Radio 24.
Nonstop power from the Tower.
Want to know what the stars have in store for you?
Stay tuned to find out what this day hol ds.
Coming up, the Astral Shower from the Power Tower.
With Chris, of course.
It' s 8: 06.
This is Radio 24.
Good morning.
Yuck, that is so gross.
What the hell is going on here?
We' il all go deaf soon at this rate.
Holy cow!
Are you losing it?
- Uwe!
- Is this an open- air concert?
Uwe, please come here.
Uwe!
- Ellen, come here.
- Uwe, you come here.
Ellen, come here, please.
Please come here.
Uwe, the raw meat in the bathtub.
- What did I tell you?
- It' s gross.
Notice anything?
Anything different?
Where' s the bird?
- Hans- Peter!
- Mascha, oh God, Mascha!
- Explain that to the kids.
- Hans- Peter!
Hans- Peter!
- Hans- Peter!
- Maybe outside.
He' s not in here.
- Oh God, no!
- Leave it open.
He might come back.
Uwe!
Be quiet.
I think I hear...
Where do we start?
I heard something here.
- Hans- Peter!
- Well, he' s not here.
- Do they fly very far?
- Why did you leave the door open?
- Maybe he' s on one of the balconies.
- That was pretty stupid.
- I had to air the flat.
- So it' s my fault.
- It' s always my fault.
- It just gets so smoky.
- I know, we need an extractor hood!
- Exactly!
It' s been a problem for weeks.
Now you blame me for airing.
Well, that' s just great!
Why do I bother anyway?
Shit.
- I' ve got to go to work too.
- I' m sorry.
Let' s have a look around the corner.
- I don' t have time now!
- It' il take five minutes!
I' ve really got to go.
I have to take the meat back.
This is pointless.
Where do you want to look?
- Birdbrain.
- He should be easy to spot.
I mean, he' s bright yellow.
- Hans- Peter?
Shit!
Do you work here?
Hi.
- I' d like to buy something.
- For yourself?
- For my better half.
For Katrin.
- Chris?
- Yes?
- Why did you get me this anyway?
- No special reason.
- Really?
The stuff cost enough!
Listen, darling...
Could you hang my T- shirt up so it doesn' t get a crease across the chest?
Yes.
I thought I' d be a pilot.
I wanted to fly planes.
I wanted to see different countries.
You say, "First finish your studies and there' il be plenty of time later."
Then you end up on a truckstop because there isn' t anything else.
And you kind of get stuck there.
It' s all very strange.
But we' re still young so it' s not too late.
Maybe Chris will get an offer in...
Vienna.
That' s a great city.
Vienna is supposed to be nice.
Yes.
Hi, this is Ellen.
Could I speak to Katrin, please?
Oh, that' s too bad.
That' s too bad.
Well...
So I can take time off.
We wanted to go to the pictures.
Katrin and I.
Oh well.
I can only manage today.
Really?
I mean...
Have you got time?
Really?
Yes.
Okay.
Bye.
Oh dear.
Hear the bird?
Hans- Peter.
- What?
- Our budgie flew away.
Do you feel guilty?
No, not really.
Neither do I.
Not in the slightest.
Who would have thought?
Me.
I' m serious.
Since yesterday.
Really?
You' re joking, right?
Me too.
Yes!
Hello, Uwe!
Katrin!
We' re doing fine!
Stop it!
Have you gone mad?
He' s gone absolutely mad!
Now my dick' s even smaller.
I want to go home!
The last time I was really happy?
That was when Ellen told me that she was having a baby.
I think that was it.
That was really great.
We were both pleased.
It was on holiday.
We had time for each other.
Time is pretty important.
You should take time for each other.
But we have to make ends meet.
We all have to make a living somehow.
Because money is something you need to live these days.
That was terrific.
Oh, here he comes.
- Evening.
- Hi.
So, what' s the problem?
One of the lights is broken.
- And now?
- Well...
- You drive me home.
- We have to take the scooter.
- It won' t fit.
- So it can go to the garage.
- Hi, Martin.
- Bye.
I can put the Vespa in the boot.
I' ve had much bigger things in there.
- Surely you can take me into work.
- I told you that I can' t tomorrow.
I have appointments and need the car.
Your wife will have no way to get to work tomorrow.
- Want me to skip work?
- No one' s saying that.
- I have a business trip tomorrow.
- Say I need a lift to my job.
Just lift it a little higher.
Just a bit higher.
- What?
- No.
- It won' t work.
- Fine, we' il try it the other way.
Do you have to work in the sticks?
It' s not funny.
Higher, higher.
It' il fit.
Another tight fit.
Uwe?
I' m going to bed.
I' il join you soon.
Sitting all the time exacerbates female problem areas.
Bottom, thighs and waist.
Many women suffer from tension.
They taste best.
The cream' s so fresh.
I' il change my image to a fat redhead.
Do you think red hair would suit me?
- Or darker.
- Like Milva.
Beautiful Milva.
I bet Chris wouldn' t notice anything if I dyed my hair.
- Sure he would.
- No.
Come off it.
Red hair?
He hasn' t been very attentive recently.
It' s like that when you' ve been together so long.
Not like it was when we first met.
Perhaps we should...
We should what?
Start again from the beginning.
That' s an idea.
You' re back again.
Brought a friend along?
Don' t stand there all day.
The stars are having a ball today.
Taureans and Scorpios particularly should now pay very close attention.
Your astral diagram is on the ascendant.
- Two hundred zlotys.
- Can I book for just a few hours?
- Yes.
Then it' s half price.
Chris?
You' re a sly fox.
Yes?
Do you think so?
It was no coincidence.
What?
You know.
The horoscopes.
What horoscopes?
Sparks will fly the 1001 st time.
Then we were together in the car.
Under the bridge.
You will have a great adventure.
Going over the border.
A new perspective.
That was today.
- Scorpio.
Do you believe all that stuff?
Yes, I do.
Well, it' s nice to have something to hold on to.
The whole world has taken on a magical glow in your eyes.
Your soul' s current high is set to continue.
The hearts of the world, one especially, lie at your feet.
I' m back.
I got out early today.
There was some sort of accident.
We were sent home.
The truckstop was dead.
Do you feel like going out somewhere?
Chrissy?
Chrissy, did you remember to...
Sorry.
Are you crazy?
What' s going on here?
Have you gone mad?
Katrin.
Christian.
My clothes.
My clothes!
My shoes!
Katrin, I' m sorry.
I should have told you.
Keep your hands off me.
Don' t stop me.
Let me out of here.
Let me go.
- Let me go!
- Where are you going?
Stay here.
What are you doing?
- Hi.
- What do you want?
Just thought I' d drop in.
- How often have I said to call first?
- I thought you' d be pleased.
You' ve picked a bad time.
That' s not my fault.
Oh, no.
Are you back already?
Stay where you are.
Don' t come into the kitchen.
Close your eyes.
Go on, close them.
Hi.
Keep your eyes shut.
Keep them shut.
Turn around.
Keep them shut.
Now.
Open your eyes.
It even has a light.
I had to move the cupboard.
It was a bit too wide.
But I thought the cupboard could go over there.
What do you think?
Very nice.
I deserve a drop too.
It' s okay, isn' t it?
Well, it' s great to see you so happy.
Is something wrong?
I' ve fallen for someone.
What do you mean, fallen for someone?
I' m sorry.
You can' t be serious.
Who is it?
That' s irrelevant.
It' s extremely relevant to me.
Who is it?
I want to know who he is.
Are you completely off your rocker?
You come in here and say you' ve fallen for someone.
Well.
It' s obvious now.
Logical really.
What an idiot.
Of course you had to work late!
Uwe.
Uwe.
I always used to think relationships had to last a lifetime.
Now I feel differently.
No endurance test.
And when you die you' ve crossed the finish line.
Perhaps this constellation doesn' t work.
What then?
Perpetual variety?
It doesn' t have to be perpetual.
It' s different if you have children.
If a whole family is involved.
But I don' t think you have to endure to the bitter end.
You could change partners every eight years.
That' s no bad thing.
You don' t gain much from it.
I used to think differently.
Excuse me.
Düring.
Now?
At the office?
I' il be there in ten minutes.
I have to go.
Uwe wants a man- to- man talk.
I' m going out.
Uwe.
To loosen our tongues.
I' m glad you' ve come.
Have a seat.
Do you want to buy a ring?
18- carat gold.
You can have it for a fiver.
After 13 years of wedlock.
Just like that.
"I' ve fallen for someone."
Man, I' m 40 now.
I can' t start again at my age.
I' m 37 myself.
Well.
- It can happen to anyone.
Crazy.
Don' t be so hard on Ellen.
Well, you' re a great moral support, aren' t you.
- Thanks a bunch.
- You expect me to boost your esteem?
I thought you' d hit me.
It' s not all Ellen' s fault.
- Well then.
Katrin is furious with Ellen.
What' s Katrin got to do with it?
She knows too.
She walked right in on us.
She caught us in the act.
I hadn' t told her anything.
What a predicament.
Ridiculous really.
Damn it.
Today really tops everything.
What an awful day.
No.
You' re pulling my leg, aren' t you?
Our number is 0180242424.
Megahits from the last 24 years.
From the 24th floor of the Oder Tower.
Nonstop power from the Power Tower.
Of course...
Shut your face!
Next stop:
Central Station.
Geminis, your day won' t be a bowl of cherries.
You are at odds with yourself.
Feel misunderstood.
Pick fights with your best friends.
Anger and frustration are in the air.
Your self- confidence is at rock- bottom.
Your best option is to sleep in.
16.
16 minutes past 7.
This is Radio 24 with the Magic Hour.
Good morning.
- Hi.
- Hello.
What are you doing here?
She sent us.
She told us to come to you after school.
- That' s right.
She' s crazy.
I don' t believe this.
I have to organize my catering.
Stupid cow.
Give us a kiss.
Sit there.
I' il be over right away.
Do you want some lunch?
- Egg and chips.
- Curry sausage.
Shit!
Sunshine, leave the kids alone.
I' m not doing anything.
Just looking.
I' m not causing trouble.
You' ve already caused enough trouble.
No, you have to...
- I was just...
- Stupid idiot!
I told you to stay away from the kids.
Clumsy oaf!
Get out of here!
Get lost!
Bastard.
No.
What a shame.
Pick that up.
Shake it off.
- It happens.
Come on.
- Well.
- Look at it!
- Shit.
- Look at it.
- He can redo it.
Would you let your son hand that in?
Do it again with him tonight.
I can' t...
- Who' s making trouble?
- Bumble.
You could grab a towel.
- Get me a towel!
Just stay cool.
- Strong and silent.
- Why should I be?
Everyone butting in.
So what?
- Strong and silent.
- Why are you poking me?
You always make mistakes.
It' s getting on my nerves.
Well.
This is all a bit strange, isn' t it.
But still.
I felt it was high time we talked about this.
Things can' t stay as they are.
It' s been going on a long time.
Quite a while now.
- Gregor.
- Go and tell him, please.
Please.
We had an agreement.
We' re all sensible adults here.
The situation we find ourselves in at the moment can' t continue.
We have a family.
We must sort this out somehow.
I don' t know.
And yours, of course, Ellen.
How do you plan to resolve this?
It' s been going on a good while.
Uwe, I don' t really know what you' re expecting to hear.
An answer.
I' m not promising anything.
I can' t do that.
You' re acting as if we were on trial.
But this isn' t something we planned secretly over a long time.
- It could as easily have been you.
- Hang on, Chris.
I can understand if you slip up and go too far.
Okay.
I can cope with that.
I can' t stand for it.
What' s the matter?
- Look, it' s turned out really well.
- That' s cute.
- Mascha' s a real artist.
Who is it?
- No one in particular.
- A lady.
But Mum and Dad have to discuss something important right now.
We' il have time later.
Why don' t you draw...
- Okay.
Thanks a lot.
- I won' t stand for it.
- I feel like I' m in kindergarten.
Who started this game, anyway?
It certainly wasn' t me.
- Sure you don' t want any cake?
- No, thanks.
- I' m not hungry.
- Here' s the ashtray.
Well, I think...
- I say you stop seeing each other.
That would be my suggestion.
I can' t promise that.
I' m not interested in talking.
I can see that, pal.
I may as well go.
Go then.
Don' t slam the door.
- I can do as I like in my own home.
- Yes, of course.
If I want to slam the door, I will.
- Does anyone want more coffee?
- No, thanks.
A totally male reaction.
- Yes.
- A 90% role, I' d say.
- Of course.
You criticized me from dawn to dusk.
Something' s happened.
All at once you start playing the injured party.
I' m glad I don' t have children.
Bye.
I think...
I see him in a new light.
I...
Now I find him very attractive again.
It sounds crazy.
And what she' s discovered in him.
Bye, Gregor.
Bye, Mascha.
Bye, love.
- Hello.
- Bye.
Our paths were bound to cross at some point.
I' m sorry.
Where are you going?
Away somewhere.
Please stay.
Just for a moment.
I want to know why.
I want to know what I' ve done.
You can tell me that at least.
- Just say what I' ve done wrong.
- I wish I could.
If it' s my bad teeth, I' il go to the dentist.
If you want a new kitchen, I' il buy you one.
What the neighbours think is more important, is it?
You' ve done nothing wrong.
I don' t understand you.
What' s the problem?
What does he have that I don' t?
Uwe, I...
- Don' t touch me.
Please.
- Please.
Please.
You made a vow to me.
A pledge.
You solemnly declared, "Till death us do part".
Don' t get sentimental.
Let me go.
- Please.
Don' t leave me.
- I won' t let you go.
- You won' t get me back like this.
This is simply ridiculous.
If you leave now, don' t bother coming back, stupid cow.
But what can I do?
I can' t change how I feel.
I can' t help it.
You can' t do anything.
The feeling is there.
I can' t resist it.
I really did try.
At first I was so careful.
I didn' t know where it would lead.
It kept going further, and...
It' s no longer just a flirt.
It' s an opportunity for me.
Düring.
Hello.
Here' s the information, all the figures and a floor plan.
This is the kitchen.
Big and spacious.
Plenty of room for a table and chairs.
- When did you want to move in?
- As soon as possible.
Let' s look at the other apartment.
It' s not ideal in my opinion.
- Living room.
- That' s stipulated?
You could use the other room as a living room if you so decide.
Lovely corner bathtub.
Great.
Is there a bath for grown- ups?
Stick your legs out.
This apartment' s cosy.
- All neat and compact.
- It' s a bit small.
Just three rooms.
But the rent for this is lower than for the other.
You could make kitchen cabinets.
If you go to all that trouble you have to stay here permanently.
We don' t quite agree on this yet.
We' il think about it.
Sleep on it.
Why all the fuss?
- What' s up?
- It' s fine.
Don' t spoil things.
- Too tiny for four.
Spare us your comments.
- She wants a sale.
We must find something.
We' il come back later.
- Well.
- We' il think about it.
It' s fine.
- We' d burst at the seams.
What' s all this about?
What are you playing at?
I' m speaking to you.
There' s your stuff.
I don' t want you in my room any more.
- Where can I go?
- Get set up in the spare room.
Katrin, it' s still our flat.
There' s more.
Here' s the perfume.
I hope you had fun at my expense.
We didn' t make fun of you at all.
Help me with this, please.
I won' t give you a hand.
I' il move your stuff, then.
- Stop this.
We' re still married.
- We' re no longer married.
- We' re still married.
- Stop flitting back and forth to her.
Our marriage isn' t ruined yet.
- We haven' t divorced.
- Isn' t ruined?
- Who destroyed everything we had?
- I just need a bit of time, damn it.
- All I need is a little time.
Is that so?
- My fling with Ellen may blow over.
- I need time too.
- You can' t promise?
You made me different promises a few years ago.
What' s the plan, anyway?
Are you going to keep coming back home?
- Just leave and move in with her.
- I need time.
Don' t run back and forth.
- I can' t leave.
Don' t you see?
- Wimp.
Yes, I' m a wimp.
And then you go back to her.
Calm down.
It' s okay.
Kiss me!
I have to pick up the goulash at 12.
It' s high time he came.
Here he is.
At last.
Sorry I' m late.
There' s been a serious accident on the autobahn.
It' s a miracle that I' m standing before you.
I really owe my life to your local radio station.
To be precise, the horoscope feature with Magic...
Magic Piss.
In the horoscope for today he strongly recommended stopping to have a break.
I regard this as a sign from heaven.
The stars are smiling on it.
We believe in Frankfurt- Oder as an industrial centre.
Time for the official ceremony.
Would you mind doing the honours?
This wasn' t planned, but...
This job is riddled with idiots.
I propose we cut the turf.
Let' s cut the first sod now.
If you both...
He' s back again.
You moron.
And wipe that smile off your face.
We have to go, don' t we?
Too bad.
Freezing cold today.
Oh, not again.
Listen to the wind out there.
Hi, Uwe.
What are you doing here, Katrin, love?
I heard you talking on my way past, so:::
What a nice surprise.
How are things?
What brings you to these climes?
Lost your way?
Laden with a rucksack, I see.
It' s sealed.
I had to get out.
I couldn' t just sit around.
Why should I wait until his lordship deigns to come?
Let' s have some music.
Leave it on.
I like that.
For a change.
Did he say he wanted to come home?
No, we weren' t that clear.
But probably...
I' ve had enough.
But I have to say, it was quite an absurd situation.
I open the bathroom door and what do I see?
The two of them in the bath!
And I say sorry and go back out again.
Honest.
I' ve been listening to that music for two weeks.
- Uwe, come on.
Can you do that?
You could join the circus.
Ms. Schröder would be impressed.
I can do it.
Katrin.
Katrin, I' m sorry.
I have to talk to you.
I' ve made a mess of everything.
And then...
If I could...
Who' s that?
- Chris?
- What' s going on?
Katrin said we could stay here and do what we like.
Turn the light off, please.
Katrin said that?
Yes.
Where is she?
I don' t know.
Please turn the light off.
That doesn' t mean you can...
Very funny.
Now they' ve invaded our bedroom.
A black hole of a day for you too.
A nasty lunar eclipse mars the night.
Venus is in reverse.
No cuddles today.
Everything is futile.
The Sun and Pluto are at loggerheads.
All in all a day to forget.
Later your energy cycle will slump to nothing.
Someone' s birthday?
- It' s for you.
- For me?
From some car dealer.
It might lift your spirits.
Dear Mr. Düring.
It saved my life.
Codswallop.
Bye.
- Hello.
Hi Mascha.
Hi Gregor.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Come to the table.
I' m in a hurry.
- Okay.
- What' s all this here?
You could clear the table.
- Must I do everything?
- We' ve just got in.
Get a move on.
Mascha?
- Dinner' s going cold.
- What is it?
Lovely curry sausage.
Tasty chips.
- Dad, not sausage.
- What' s up?
- They' re coming out of our ears.
I can' t do with fussy eaters.
With me you' il eat what you' re given.
- I' m due at the dentist.
- I don' t need this hassle.
Yes.
I can' t do everything at once.
I' m just warming it up now.
Well, so much for that.
Order a pizza.
- Where' s the number?
- In the kitchen.
- Where in the kitchen?
- I don' t know.
Use your eyes.
Shit.
Hey, Dad?
Dad, are you okay?
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I' m fine.
Dad' s listening down the toilet.
So what do you think?
This is it!
- Is the entire ceiling sloping?
- Yes.
It' s an attic apartment.
In a bad mood?
Like today' s horoscope.
You won' t get a bed up here.
This isn' t funny any more.
What' s wrong with you?
- I hate this ceiling.
- This is the seventh.
- You don' t want to move in with me.
- I don' t want to crawl everywhere.
Let' s go back down.
- No problem.
It' s not my cup of tea.
What' s wrong with you?
Nothing.
You' re looking at me strangely.
I have a funny feeling.
I' m sorry.
Sorry for what?
Bye.
Bye.
Chris?
One sign of bad breath is when your spouse says,
"You smell funny today".
Let' s take a look in your mouth.
Open your mouth, please.
Oh dear!
Let' s suck up this saliva.
There he is!
Look at this.
There' s a bit of root attached.
Uwe.
Uwe.
What are you doing here?
This won' t take long.
I came to tell you Ellen and I have stopped seeing each other.
So?
Best of luck, okay?
Hey, Chris.
Chris.
This one' s similar.
You need to have some kind of idea of what it is you want.
- Yes, I see.
Thank you.
Which one goes where?
This goes here.
May I?
- Something spicier, perhaps?
- No, thank you.
The open notes.
I like this one.
I need a little break.
This one has lovely packaging.
Let me know if you' d like to try another.
I' m starting to think...
- Thank you.
- Susanne, can you cover me?
- Evening.
I' m looking for Katrin.
- She' s not here.
- She' s gone?
- Yes.
Shit.
What' s going on now?
Why do these damned things always happen to me?
I don' t believe this.
Here you are.
It' s delicious.
The electricity company can' t explain the blackout.
The Frankfurt power cut was spookily predicted by Radio 24 presenter Magic Chris during his look at the stars on yesterday morning' s show.
Listeners were thrilled by the accuracy of his prediction.
What catastrophes lie in wait today, Magic Chris?
Well.
Nothing exciting today.
A special horoscope for Taureans.
Taureans born on 8 May.
So, here it is.
Wherever you are right now, you shoul d know that someone loves you very much.
He has severed all other ties.
He knows that he really messed things up.
It was probably the worst he ever made.
Give him a second chance.
You won' t regret it.
That was a special horoscope due to recent events.
This is Radio 24 with the hits of the last 24 years.
It' s 8: 50, that' s ten to nine.
Good morning from Chris.
Well?
Do you like it?
New kitchen, new joy.
My Ellen.
I' m so happy you' re here.
You...
You don' t understand, do you?
You just don' t get it.
I' m leaving.
I' m moving out.
Ellen.
Ellen.
Hans- Peter!
Easy does it.
How did you get here?
- Has no one called for me?
- No, no phone calls at all.
Okay, one last try.
- I can' t introduce you.
- Everyone knows me anyway.
Sorry.
That was Britney Spears.
Here is a special horoscope for Gemini.
Someone you' ve waited for a long time.
That person will call... now.
This big room will be the living room.
If we move in here.
So, this is the biggest room.
The stars favour a change of scene.
If you want to move, do it now.
Be brave and make your own decisions.
Don' t do what people tell you.
Pinching pennies won' t make them work harder.
Travel to foreign lands.
Live your dreams.
A good day for matters of the heart.
Don' t cling to the past.
Open your eyes, look around.
You may find true love too.
Sometimes...
Want to come inside?
Don' t you want to come in?
It' s raining.
Come inside.
Come in and listen to the music.
The French tried to build a canal here before the Americans.
At the height of their effort, 500 workers...... were dying every week from malaria and yellow fever.
They couldn' t come up with cemetery space fast enough...... not to mention the morale problem all those crosses would have made.
So they bought shiploads of vinegar in Cuba...... and in each barrel, they sealed one corpse.
And then they sold them as medical cadavers all over Europe.
And for a while, that was their principal source of profit.
You see, this place has always had a special way of dealing...... with both profit and death.
As some of you may have heard, there is a hurricane warning tonight.
Well, Rangers do not wait on good weather.
Oh, no.
Rangers are trained to operate in the worst possible conditions...... and take said conditions and turn them against their enemy.
You each have one rifle, one sidearm and one white phosphorus grenade.
This is a live E and E, so please keep those weapons safetied...... so as not to shoot off your nonexistent dicks.
The rally point is a bunker two clicks north of the LZ.
You will split into teams of two.
Each designated area has 20 reactive targets.
The first team to get all 20 and reach the rally point wins.
Anything goes pear- shaped out there, you pop white and radio in.
I will be in each area monitoring your progress.
If I see anybody drag ass...... I swear to God, you will swim the canal.
- Where is the original pickup point?
- About two klicks up the valley.
So this was a Ranger training team?
When were they due?
They missed contact six hours ago.
Colonel Styles, that doesn' t necessarily mean anything in a storm like this.
No, it wouldn' t be any wonder if they were delayed.
I' m not seeing them.
I' m gonna have to come back around.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I' m coming around to your side.
We got one -- No, maybe two.
Wait, I think he' s carrying somebody.
All right, let' s get down there.
What is that?
Is that live fire?
Get us on the ground.
Now!
You went out with your sergeant and six men last night on an exercise.
You came back a few men light.
Four, to be precise.
Where are they?
Not in this lifetime.
Captain...... if you don' t make progress on this, we' il have Washington crawling all over us.
What did he write?
Someone from off- post. "
Let me see it.
Nothing more.
I know somebody.
- Sir, I am confident that I can handle this.
- And I' m not.
Oh, God.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
- Tom, what' s wrong with your phone?
There' s a hurricane.
Everything' s shut down.
- Hola, Tommy!
- It' s carnival, come on.
- The girl' s name is Gabriella!
- She wants to meet you.
- Yeah, we' il samba!
- Are you coming?
I will.
You better.
I' m gonna come and get you.
- What' s that?
- Nothing like that.
Any time a cocaine dealer is suspected of bribing an agent...... we pull him off the assignment and run a check.
It' s not personal.
A drug lord that I helped bust says that he paid me off...... you guys believe him, and say it' s not personal?
Fuck you.
Relax, I' m sure you' il come up clean.
You' il be back on the job in a week.
With everyone looking at me sideways, wondering if I' m dirty.
Look, I' m DEA in cocaine central.
All we have down here is trust.
And after what you did, nobody' s ever gonna trust me -- Hold on.
Tom, Bill.
I need you to come down here.
- Come down where?
- Clayton, as soon as possible.
- Something happened.
- Are you all right?
No.
No, I need your help.
Sir?
Sir, this is completely unorthodox.
This guy isn' t even Army.
Go ahead, sir.
He was Army.
I hadn' t seen him in years...... until I ran into him the other night in a parking lot.
Trust me, he was Army.
He trained at Benning and here with me, so he knows the territory.
Before he left the service, he was the best interrogator I had ever seen.
Tom Hardy could get in your head faster than you could tie your shoes.
- Why did he leave the Army?
- I don' t know and I don' t care...... because there is nobody better in a room.
Sir, if he' s not Army, it' s not official.
Evening, sir.
It doesn' t get unofficialer than that.
- Hey, Bill, how is it going?
You?
Wet.
So how' s the knee?
They' re never gonna make me a general anyway.
Why am I here?
I' m curious about that myself, sir.
I am the provost marshal here.
- Osborne, do I look like a "sir" to you?
- Not particularly, sir.
Captain, Osborne is the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
How does that make you feel?
- Hostile and uncooperative, sir.
Okay.
Tom, look, before this hurricane hit...... I recalled all exercises except for one...... a six- man Ranger team and their Black Hat out in the bush.
- Not West?
Oh, tell me it wasn' t West.
- You know Sergeant West, sir?
- He was our Black Hat.
- That' s one way to put it.
West is a professional, the face of the modern Army.
You notice I' m no longer in the Army.
They were due for pickup at 18: 30.
No.
The problem is, one of them is dead...... one has a bullet in his hip and one won' t talk.
Now the one who won' t talk was exchanging live fire with the dead one.
I' m assuming that' s what made him the dead one.
Sergeant Mueller, killed right in front of me.
If Command finds out you' re using a civilian...... with my background, forget it, they' il cut you a new asshole.
Anything you uncover will be credited to Osborne.
- Well, then, let her do it.
- Sir, that is not a bad idea.
Captain, will you excuse us for a moment?
All due respect to Osborne, this is way out of her league.
This kid we have in interrogation requested a Ranger.
That' s you.
Jesus, Bill, he could have requested a sailboat.
It doesn' t mean you have to give it to him.
I don' t get this.
Any spooks involved here?
ClA?
Not exactly.
What does that mean?
There was a group of guys down here and they....
Come on, Bill, spill it.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
I know who you are.
The DEA is investigating you for bribery.
Suspicion of bribery.
It' s all in the wording, really.
I' m not comfortable having you involved with this.
Three things:
First, you don' t have a choice.
Second, I' ve never taken a bribe in my life.
And third, I' m still a little drunk from earlier today...... so if I skip over the witty banter...... and move straight into coming on to you, I hope you don' t take offense.
Levi?
Who would name their kid Levi?
General Jonathan Kendall, of the Joint Chiefs.
Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone.
Kendall Jr. will be unconscious for at least another hour.
The soldier we' re talking to first is Dunbar.
- Yes, sir.
- Move him.
- Why?
Interrogation rooms tend to look suspiciously like interrogation rooms...... which makes people uncomfortable.
- Excuse me?
- Dunbar, is he cute?
- lf you' re not gonna take this seriously -- - Is he handsome?
Does he carry himself well?
Does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor?
Does he have good bones, which suggests good breeding?
Does he slouch or sit up?
These are questions that reveal a great deal about a man' s character.
Get over yourself for two- and- a- half seconds and tell me, is he cute?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
I' il let you know how it turns out.
Agent Hardy, if this goes to trial someone is gonna have to testify...... about what' s said in interrogation.
And with your colorful background...... you' d be the most impeachable witness in history.
Now, I may be stuck with you, but you' re definitely stuck with me.
Okay.
At some point I want you to go bad cop on him.
- The signal will be my rubbing my nose.
Look for both.
Any donuts around here?
I questioned him for two hours.
He didn' t make a sound.
You try poking him with a stick?
I didn' t learn sophisticated techniques like that.
Ten bucks.
That' s without telling him I' m a Ranger.
Go.
Sergeant Dunbar, good evening.
I' m Tom Hardy.
I believe you' ve already met the vivacious Captain Osborne.
I understand that you' ve had a rough time of it out there...... and that you' re not talking.
Did they feed you yet?
You can still eat in front of someone and not talk.
My parents did it for years.
You want another one?
Maybe later.
Okay, Ray, I' m gonna be upfront with you.
I don' t know if you did what you did in self- defense...... and frankly, I don' t care.
The thing is, I made an agreement with a friend...... to talk to you till your transport showed up.
So....
You like baseball?
Oh, I could talk baseball for days.
You know, batting averages, ERAs, I got statistics in my brain.
I don' t know how I remember them.
It' s freaky.
You wanna talk baseball?
Oh, come on, Ray, we gotta talk about something.
We' re gonna be here for six hours.
Who do you like?
Sir, I don' t like baseball.
Why not?
I believe the game of baseball to be too slow.
Too slow?
It' s a game of anticipation.
That' s the beauty.
Well, sir, I just don' t like it.
I' m sorry I don' t have an adequate explanation.
Well, that' s all right.
I' m not gonna kneecap you or anything.
Sir, I requested a fellow Ranger.
I just....
It' s just that you thought I looked like a scumbag.
It turns a lot of people off.
You know, I was here in the 75th, under Sergeant West.
Yeah, he had a wicked- looking blade.
Yeah.
He still got that?
Yes, sir.
Well, the reason I remember is he would use me as his knife dummy.
- Oh, yeah.
What West used to do is he would say that he could...... slice a man from stem to sternum, the stem being your dick, okay?
Well, anyway...... if you' re his knife dummy, he would just ram this pipe into your balls all day.
And that was a long day.
By the way, Ray, I promised I would ask where West and the others are...... and can they be found?
There' s no need.
They' re dead, aren' t they?
Yes, sir.
You kill them?
Look, we got enough on you to deep- fry your ass!
Back to silent treatment, fine by me.
- I' m just gonna have to haul your ass -- - Okay, whoa.
Look, Ray, this is what you call "good cop- bad cop."
She shouts.
You' re grateful.
This establishes some sort of bond of trust.
I don' t wanna play games with you...... so I say we take a break.
And get you another donut.
You see if you wanna talk anymore.
- You set me up.
I believe somebody owes me 10 bucks.
You could have told me what you were planning.
By admitting it, I could gain his trust.
- You think he did it?
- No, sir.
Yes.
What about the rest of my people?
In 5 1/ 2 hours, it' il be out of our hands.
I' m gonna have a lot to answer for.
I' d appreciate it if you could get me some of those answers.
- Why did you ask for a Ranger?
- I' m not telling you what happened.
Why don' t you tell us about the others?
Tell us about Sergeant West.
Is he still the same prick?
I do not care that you are triple volunteers.
I do not care that you think you are hard.
And I especially don' t give a rat' s fuck what four- star general' s dick...... you sucked to get the privilege of being able stand before me today.
Those of you I deem unworthy will not remain.
Is that understood?
Hoo- ha, sergeant!
Those of you I find lacking will quit.
And those of you who refuse to quit will have a training accident.
This base suffers three training accidents a year.
Unfortunate accidents that I will not hesitate to repeat...... if you cross me.
Is that understood?
- Give me a "Hoo- ha, sergeant."
- Hoo- ha, sergeant!
- And what' s your name?
- Sergeant, my name is Pike, sergeant.
Pike, surrender your sidearm for inspection.
What the fuck are you doing?
Have you lost your fucking mind?
- You told me to relinquish -- - Are you talking?
Who the fuck told you to speak?!
A Ranger never relinquishes his weapon!
Everybody better give me a "Hoo- ha, sergeant."
- Hoo- ha, sergeant!
- Now, son...... there are people in this world that will kill you for no damn reason...... other than something passing through their mind!
I hail from Biloxi, Mississippi, where vanilla motherfuckers like that...... used to hang us from trees by our necks on a whim!
Does that sound like the kind of fucking place you want to grow up?
Sergeant, no, sergeant!
Are you implying something negative about the great state of Mississippi?
From the beginning, West had a chip on his shoulder for this guy named Pike.
By the time we did Green Hell, it was getting nuts.
Green Hell was 20 days in the Darien at 40 clicks a day...... with an 80- pound pack on your back.
We got real used to number oddities like that.
The course was called Jungle Leader and the idea...... was to teach you how to think when you were exhausted.
And West really knew how to get you exhausted.
We spent our nights doing escape and evasions...... with live fire snapping by our heads...... or else up to our noses in some damn swamp...... slapping bugs and dodging snakes.
The nights we did mock POW stuff, they wouldn' t let us sleep at all.
We humped over the Cordillera three times...... all the way to the Colombian border and back.
Some of that stuff is steep as hell and the rain never let up for days.
Those packs got heavy in the rain...... and nobody ever hated anything like we hated those damn packs.
There was this one escarpment, it wasn' t more than 500 feet...... but, Jesus, it was slippery.
Mr. Pike...
Mr. Pike...... can you tell me the muzzle velocity of an M- 16?
Yeah.
- Eleven hundred, sergeant.
- Eleven hundred what?
Meters per second, sergeant.
- Come on.
- Twenty....
Come on.
Too tired to think?
Zero, schmuck.
Moses wasn' t on the Ark.
Have you lost it?
Well, tell me this.
What is your weapon?
Your weapon, man.
Your weapon.
What keeps you alive and makes the other guy die?
What is your weapon?
It' s your brain, Mr. Pike.
Your smarts.
Your gray matter.
Your poise under fire.
Your wits, when all about you are losing theirs.
I think you came to this party unarmed, Mr. Pike.
Take off your pack.
Take it off.
Here, I' il help you.
You can' t complete this march without a pack, Mr. Pike.
I suggest you go back and get it, even if it takes 40 days and 40 nights.
That business bothered a lot of the guys...... even Mueller, who was a redneck you felt uncomfortable sleeping around.
Dumb shit.
So that' s what we were coming back from yesterday afternoon.
We figured we' d finally get a shower and a hot meal.
I mean, we were the walking dead.
We were about as ragged- out as a man could ever get.
Here comes Master West himself.
What we have here is an opportunity.
A unique opportunity for a spectacular training event.
Kendall.
Castro.
Weapons only.
- Jesus Christ.
- What was that, Mr. Pike?
You think a little rain is inappropriate for combat?
That the game should be called on account of weather?
Are you concerned for their safety?
What?
- No, sergeant.
- Good, then you can join them.
Those are the guys that went on the exercise with you?
Yeah, and that is all I' m saying.
Ray?
You smoke?
Is this a trick where you won' t give me a cigarette till I tell you more?
No, I just forgot mine in the car, and I was hoping that you had some.
My brand.
My lucky day.
You seem like a good guy, Ray.
You carried Kendall wounded to the pickup...... but I just don' t understand.
What did you do to make Mueller want to kill you?
I' m not saying anything else.
I just don' t understand why he asked for a Ranger.
The man' s in trouble.
- So?
- Ranger code.
Never leave a man behind.
What' s the matter?
This place gives me the willies.
- Not the happiest of memories, huh?
Kid gloves.
- I mean it.
Kid gloves.
I got it.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Tommy, that you?
How are you?
I' m good.
I know.
Let me guess, you two trained together?
Guilty as charged, Julie- bird.
What are you doing here?
- You' re not getting all nostalgic on me?
- No, I can' t tell you --
Yeah.
We' re busy as hell too.
Packing up supplies...... getting ready for the move stateside.
Who' d have thunk it?
Pete Vilmer, bettering society.
Shall we see Kendall or would you like to continue...... the backslapping for a couple of minutes?
"Julie- bird."
Now if I were a smart man, and I am not...... I could come to the conclusion that you two saw each other socially.
Oh, I' ve seen you around the base before, but...... well, are you in the Army or...?
Coast Guard.
We' re worried about Florida beaches.
Oh, I' ve seen you before.
You were in the newspaper.
You' re that DEA agent with friends in low places.
Oh, the price of fame.
Oh, no.
I' m really fatigued.
I feel all drugged- up.
Our collective hearts weep.
Well, we just wanna know what happened out there.
Oh, you wanna know what happened?
Well, there are degrees of truth, captain.
You know, there are always degrees and things are not what they seem.
You know, this is --
It is too late and I am too tired to give a shit...... about some pissant lieutenant' s bad version of intrigue.
You' re trying too hard, Levi.
You know how I can tell?
Because you' re sweating, and you' re sweating...... because you don' t know how much Dunbar told us already.
Excuse me.
- Those were kid gloves?
- I thought I did pretty well up till the end.
You mean when you yelled at him and walked out?
Well, that would be the end, yeah.
Go back?
We just blew it.
- I thought you didn' t have any cigarettes.
- I lied.
- Will you just wait?
- For what?
Excuse me.
A patient is asking for you.
Shall we?
My father is what you would call a very powerful man.
- So we' ve heard.
- Oh, come on, you know...... you don' t know the half of it.
You know, all my life he' s made me feel weak and insignificant.
Yeah, I think that is reason why I joined the military in the first place.
And how is that going for you?
Oh, it' s horrible.
I fucking hate the military.
You' re terrified of him, aren' t you?
No, no, we just hate each other.
You know, and normally he wouldn' t lift a finger to do anything for me...... but the one thing he cannot stand is a scandal...... and you know, a joint chief...... with a homosexual son in the military definitely qualifies as scandal.
Well, that blows "Don' t ask, don' t tell" out of the water.
So is this family history lesson coming to a point?
About four months ago, I began a relationship with a local...... and my father decided to intercede.
And Colonel Styles...... made the incident quiet.
But according to my father...... transferred me into West' s training course.
And, you know, West just hated that.
He made sure everyone knew where I was and all that.
Couldn' t kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
Well, he wanted more than that.
More intrigue, Levi?
I swear to God, you will swim the canal!
The teams are as follows...
Dunbar and...... Mueller.
Pike and Nunez.
Kendall and...... Castro.
You have one minute to touch down.
Get your shit together!
That' s when he did it.
It was clear as day.
Did anyone else see or hear this?
No, of course not.
There was a helicopter, you know?
- Nobody could hear anything.
- I don' t know how familiar you are...... with investigative work, but there' s this thing called motive.
And you just gave yourself one.
Well, you wanted to know what happened...
- What happened to degrees?
I didn' t kill him.
Thirty seconds to LZ.
Click in!
On the skids!
Lose the communicators!
I did want to tell someone, but Mueller would' ve just laughed...... and Nunez wouldn' t have given a shit.
I suppose neither would Pike or Dunbar.
Of course, West had me paired with Castro...... who treated me like a leper from the day that I met him.
I started getting it in my head that maybe West had paid him.
Maybe he was the one who was supposed to give me a training accident.
All I could think of was West was out here...... somewhere in this godforsaken swamp...... making us stalk around in this hurricane, and just waiting.
Hey!
What the fuck are you doing?
- This is fucking ridiculous!
- Shut up and shoot something!
I was terrified, and I wasn' t about to be...... the victim of some discriminative hate crime.
I was terrified.
You know, enough to want to murder somebody.
But you didn' t.
Come on!
Come on!
Is that West?
Whose area is this?
West.
- What did you do?
You kill him?
We found him like this.
Where' s Pike?
Where' s Pike?
- We got separated.
- Yeah?
- Before or after the explosion?
Before or after the explosion?
- I don' t know.
- What do you mean?
I mean, I don' t fucking know, okay?
We got separated, so shut the fuck up!
Shut up!
Exercise over!
Get out of here!
Radio' s had it.
- Are we gonna leave him like this?
The MPs will secure the site till the ClD gets here.
- What about Pike?
You can if you want.
Fucking do something, okay?
Where you been?
You guys all right?
Where' s Pike?
- What?
He took a phosphorus grenade in the back.
- No.
He' s out there smoldering.
How long have you guys been here?
Ten minutes.
-... we heard an explosion.
- That' s your story?
- Yeah, that' s our story, Nunez.
- Watch it, motherfucker!
Hey!
Hey, calm down!
Everybody just calm down!
Where the hell is Pike?
We got separated, okay?
She just doesn' t remember if it was before or after the explosion.
- Before the explosion, all right?
- Yeah.
- Before the explosion.
- So you think Pike did it?
Does anybody know the shit that we are in, how fucked we all are?
Kendall!
Let me see your grenade, Nunez.
- Yeah, let' s see it, Nunez.
- Let' s see that.
- Get off!
This is bullshit, man.
This is so bullshit.
I' m so sick of you guys.
Are you happy now?
One.
Here it is.
You see it?
So sorry to disappoint you.
You' re not gonna have a strip- search tonight.
The man is fucking dead, all right?
So, what happened?
- Must be a level three out there.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Pike, you got your grenade?
No, I used it.
You know West is dead?
Of course I do.
I killed him.
- He admitted it?
- He thought we would all be on board.
He was that type of guy, I guess.
You know, apparently, Pike wasn' t even his real name.
He changed it --
Come on, come on, focus, Levi.
Okay, fine.
So then Mueller went after him...... and we had to pull him back and calm him down...... and we said that we would turn Pike in.
So then everybody agreed...... and....
Kendall!
Come here.
Come here!
Come here.
Don' t tell me that you ain' t glad that West is dead.
Now we got a opportunity here.
- I don' t know what you' re talking about.
All right?
Now, all we gotta do is get rid of Mueller and Nunez.
We get the other guys to play along...... and we can be the men that took down our sergeant' s killers.
All we gotta do is tell the story right.
You' re out of your mind.
After I woke up, I saw Pike and Dunbar talking.
No!
You sack of shit!
It was just a reflex.
I must' ve passed out, because the next thing I knew....
- Mueller was chasing Dunbar?
- Because he had shot Castro.
Why did he carry you out?
I don' t know.
Maybe he wanted somebody to cover for him.
But I can' t.
I know what I saw.
And he killed those men.
Of course.
Okay.
That' s it.
What did Dunbar say to you?
I don' t drink beer.
What about the case?
You don' t drink beer?
Who doesn' t drink beer?
Me.
What about the case?
The case is done, with two hours and 40 minutes to spare.
What do you think?
- You believed Kendall?
- Absolutely.
Because Dunbar wouldn' t tell us everything.
Because he did it.
Dunbar came back for Kendall.
I don' t think he' s capable of murder.
- How long you been doing this?
That means less than a year.
Osborne, murder is basic.
No conspiracies, no grand mysteries...... no puppet masters behind the scenes pulling the strings.
Everyone is capable of murder.
Dunbar' s our guy.
Look, there' s no physical proof.
From Dunbar?
Forget it.
You' re not gonna talk that kid into giving himself up for the death penalty.
- Nevertheless.
- Nevertheless what?
Kendall will testify.
That' s all we need.
It' s not enough for me.
Hey, Ray.
Had a nice talk with your buddy, Kendall.
- That son of a bitch.
- Well, that' d be my reaction too.
- He' s lying.
Why didn' t you say something?
We would' ve dropped the charges.
I' m serious, goddamn it!
Fuck your "serious." Right now, we' d take the word of a crackhead over yours.
Say it.
Did Kendall tell you about the drugs?
- About the business Mueller ran?
He sold them out of the hospital for 50 bucks a pop.
West is easier to handle when you can' t feel the pain.
Oh, that' s good, Ray.
- It' s not like that.
Then why didn' t you bring this up before you were accused of murder?
Don' t say it.
I' il tell you.
Drug charges in the Army come with a 20- year sentence.
You figured Kendall fucked you, you' il fuck him right back.
- I didn' t shoot West.
- I know.
Pike did.
You think you know everything, don' t you?
You haven' t even scratched the surface.
I know enough to know that you' ve got two choices.
You can sign a confession and spend the rest of your life in a cell...... or you can tell us to fuck off and you' il be hanged.
Now...... am I scratching your surface yet?
Dumb bastard!
- Excuse me?
- The next time...... I wanna borrow your balls, I' il ask you.
Tom?
Where are you going?
I' m out of here.
What about the confession?
Why don' t you confess?
The only reason you brought me here...... was to protect your career.
People are dead and you don' t give a shit.
You' re the base commander.
You know what he' s all about and you stood by.
He deserved it.
Now, there!
There' s your fucking confession.
Hardy?
Hardy!
What about Dunbar?
What about what he said about the drugs?
You are incredible! lf someone said "Santa Claus," you' d say:
We haven' t explored the flying reindeer angle! "
- No, no, wait!
You stop right there.
I was there!
I was tortured by that guy!
I wanted him dead 1 5 years ago!
And now, I should feel bad about someone who offed him?
Forget it.
- So fuck the Army, right?
- That' s right.
Yeah, all they wanted to do is serve their country and take a stand...
-... and protect assholes like you!
Don' t you talk to me like some recruiting poster...
-... because I did my time!
- And you couldn' t hack it!
- Yeah.
You were like me once.
You believed in the whole honor and duty thing...... and trying to make a difference.
Isn' t that what you said?
- I was trying to get your number.
- 334- 5644.
- Thank you.
- You believed it.
I saw it in your eyes.
You believed in it and those kids did too.
Now they' il never tell their story.
Never gonna get to expose West for the monster you say he was.
I thought you wanted me gone.
You grew on me.
Look, I' m gonna go in there, and I' m gonna talk to Kendall...... and to Dunbar, and I' m gonna try to figure this whole mess out...... because I care what happened out there.
And I think you do too.
- "I didn' t shoot West."
That' s what Dunbar said.
"I didn' t shoot West." West wasn' t shot.
Kendall said he was burned by a phosphorus grenade.
Dunbar never saw the body.
Hey, look, I apologize.
- You saw West' s body?
- Of course I did.
- Where?
- Down by the creek bed.
- Yeah.
What about the phosphorus grenade?
One went off, yeah, but it didn' t touch him.
Tell us.
- What did you do?
- We found him like this.
You kill him?
We found him like this!
Kendall said that only Nunez showed up at the body.
- You were at the bunker with Mueller.
- He' s lying.
I was at the body.
- Where you been?
- West.
Back up.
- Mueller was alone in the bunker?
- Yeah.
What are you doing here alone?
Pike and I got separated, then I heard gunfire.
Well, so did we.
Why you didn' t come?
So where' s your grenade?
And I didn' t buy it, but Mueller still had his grenade.
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
Okay, what happened next?
Pike came back.
Mueller, what the hell happened to you?
Where were you?
One minute you' re next to me, the next you' re gone...
-... the sky lights up like Christmas.
- Where' ve you been, Jay?
There' s a hurricane out there, okay?
My radio' s busted.
- Where' s West?
- Yeah, right.
Shut up.
West is dead.
What?
- Where' ve you been, Jay?
- I said, I couldn' t --
No, no, no, no.
Fuck you.
- Fuck you!
Stop it!
No!
- Okay, hello!
We just wanna see your pack.
- Why?
That' s why.
A dead body shows up and just put it on the darkest face in the room?
- It' s not like that and you know it.
Do I, Dunbar?
I just want you, papi, to show them your pack.
Right now.
Good.
Tie him up.
Come here.
Come here close, I wanna talk to you.
We' re friends, right?
- Ray, we' re friends, right?
- Yeah.
Well then, come on, man, untie me!
You know that I didn' t do this.
- You hated West more than any of us.
- Maybe, but not enough to be a killer.
- You' re the one missing a grenade.
- Anybody could have taken that out.
Did you check your pack coming in on the bird?
Look, you know I don' t have this in me.
- lf not you, then who?
- Mueller, that' s who.
Oh, come on, man.
We were scanning the area together then he just ups and disappears?
- That' s what he says about you.
- Who you gonna believe...... a redneck or your friend?
- Listen, check my pack.
That' s a combat cocktail.
Demerol and anabolics.
- Mueller gave it to me.
- You' re lying, man.
Does that look like I' m lying?
It kills the pain, focuses the brain, man.
I' ve been using for about eight weeks solid.
After that first night, man, it was bad.
Malnutrition and exposure.
I needed something to keep me from crashing and Mueller hooked me up.
The way I see it, West knew.
He found out and was gonna report him.
Yes!
Mueller and Castro.
They must' ve sabotaged the radios and...... one of them must' ve taken a grenade out of my pack on the chopper.
Who popped white?
What the hell' s going on?!
I don' t know, sarge!
I don' t know what happened!
Get down!
How was he killed?
His chest was hamburger, Jake.
See, that' s close range.
You go full- auto on somebody, close range...... they' re gonna be swimming in blood.
I don' t have a drop on me.
Now, how about Mueller?
When I walked in, he wasn' t wearing shit.
- I don' t know, man.
This is a lot of shit to digest!
I gotta think!
Come on, Ray, man, we don' t have time to think!
We need to go now!
No, listen.
Let' s wait till we get back, then we' il tell everything to the MPs.
If we wait, I am a dead man.
I have a black face and there are a hundred men out there...... dying to testify how much I hated West.
My court- martial will take five minutes.
I don' t got that time.
You gotta make up your mind, man.
Untie me.
Come on, Ray.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, wake up!
- Hey, hey.
This place is gonna go!
- You were gonna cut him loose!
- Why?
- Because I didn' t do it, Nunez!
- We all know what you did, Pike.
Ask him where his shirt is!
My shirt?
I was soaking wet.
That' s a convenient excuse for the murderer.
- I was freezing from the hurricane!
- So you took your shirt off?
I wasn' t wearing a poncho, goddamn it!
Hey, what about him?
Maybe you brought an extra shirt.
- We' re not going anywhere.
Sergeant Mueller, you are under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant West.
- You have no authority -- - It doesn' t matter...... because you will be charged with murder!
- You will be court- martialed....
- What are you doing?
- Shut up, you dumb fucking nigger!
- You fucking white- trash motherfucker!
I saw you do it!
Jesus!
- He wouldn' t shut the fuck up!
So you killed him?
Put the gun away!
- You too?
Pike got free.
That' s our story.
- West was one thing, but this is -- - Shut up!
We have two dead bodies and a story that explains them.
That' s what we' re gonna say.
- You' re either with us or against us.
- Castro, put it down!
Which is it?
Castro!
Goddamn it, now we' re gonna have to shoot them both.
Can I get some more coffee?
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
Okay.
So the plan was kill West, blame it on Pike.
And for that to work, okay, you need a witness.
- Exactly.
So it' s a good plan, but it goes wrong.
Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy...... so they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into their cover story.
And Kendall might' ve agreed if the hurricane hadn' t butt- fucked the bunker.
"Butt- fucked the bunker"?
Well, I just -- Well, you know.
What do you think?
I think we' re gonna need proof.
And, Ray?
Ray?
Otherwise, this is just another story.
Pike said the supplier was somebody over at the hospital.
Guy named Vilmer.
Oh, my God.
I haven' t had one of these since college.
- How long you and Pete been together?
- On and off for two years.
Serious?
Semi.
For you or for him?
You don' t get to interrogate me, Hardy.
Know about the drugs?
- Sorry, I gotta ask.
Did you?
- No!
Gotta put him in a room, you know.
Try and stop me.
Yes, sir.
Guy named Vilmer.
Well, shit, if it' s on tape, it' s gotta be true.
Piece of advice?
Charming' s not the tack to take with us right now.
I want a lawyer.
No.
Excuse me?
No, you can' t have a lawyer.
Fuck you, Julie- bird.
Uniform Code of Military Justice says I get a lawyer.
I don' t have to say shit to you.
How about them Yankees?
Now, Peter, what I just did is illegal.
It' il kill my career in the Army.
And that will end any chance of going to law school...... so I don' t have anything to lose.
Now, do you really want to go round two?
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck!
I called them "combat cocktails." Okay?
I got them hooked, I had them push, once they were in, they couldn' t get out.
It was a perfect goddamn crime.
How' d you get around the drug testing?
Who do you think administered the tests?
I swapped their dirty piss for someone else' s clean.
They could use all they wanted and never pop positive.
- Who else was involved?
Who else was involved?
Mueller and that kid who took a bullet.
What, you didn' t know that?
How' d you recruit them?
You know how it is in Panama, Tommy.
It' s easy to spot the bad eggs.
After that it was smooth.
That' s it.
When did West find out?
I didn' t know he knew.
I just supply.
That' s real noble.
Thanks for clarifying.
How long have you been doing this?
Gee, I wasn' t looking at my watch.
- Were you doing this while we were --?
- While we were fucking?
Yeah.
Right under your nose.
- Riggs?
- Yes, ma' am.
Read this gentleman his rights and...... see to it that he gets medical attention and stick him in a cell.
Yes, ma' am.
Nice seeing you again, Pete.
Why would he risk 20 years in prison just to sell a few painkillers?
Doesn' t add up.
Kendall' s the key.
Ma' am, colonel' s looking for you and Mr. Hardy.
Tell him we' il be right up.
How far do you want to go with this?
I think we should go see Bill, hand over Vilmer...... give him Dunbar' s confession and forget about Kendall.
So Vilmer admitted to supplying the drugs?
Yes.
- Christ.
- Now, look, Bill...... you know, you got Vilmer' s confession, Dunbar' s confession...... that is more than enough to clear you with ClD.
Good.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Then we' il get out of here.
There is one more thing, sir.
Vilmer says Kendall was involved in the drug scam.
Captain, I don' t wanna hear this.
Well, actually, Kendall did try to burn Dunbar with us, so...... that usually means someone' s involved.
Captain Osborne, you are not to go near Lieutenant Kendall.
Understood?
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar.
Why don' t you ask him about the murders...... he' s covered up for his drug dealer?
Or do you just not think about it?
Running out of time!
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.
Mueller shot Pike point- blank in cold blood.
Don' t get me wrong.
Mueller was perfectly capable of murder.
He was the type of guy that you felt uncomfortable going to sleep around.
Why did you pin three murders on Dunbar?
The man saved your life.
Oh, so I should cover up for his misdeeds?
- What?
I was just telling you the truth.
- Not according to Pete Vilmer.
Vilmer.
Vilmer.
Vilmer, Vilmer, Vilmer.
Is that what you think you have on me?
You have to do better than that.
You guys are on drugs.
- What do you mean?
What Kendall' s saying about "the type of guy you feel uncomfortable...... sleeping next to"?
That' s what Dunbar said about Mueller.
Hardy, they planned this.
Not bad for hostile and uncooperative.
- You' re running out of time now!
- You and Dunbar got your story straight.
You two just kept bouncing us back and forth, trying to...... figure out the differences, killing time till transport can whisk you away.
You' re accessory to murder, you understand that?
Right, Hardy?
- lf he' s lucky.
- You know what?
You' re full of shit.
You are fucking full of shit.
What, you scared, Levi?
Is that why you' re laughing?
You think we got nothing on you?
No, it doesn' t.
Know why?
We' il find one of those bodies...... and I' m gonna make sure it has a bullet in it that matches your weapon.
What' s going on?
What' s happening?
Kendall?
Suction!
Give me suction!
- Get that tube in there!
- Hold him!
Sir.
You' re relieved of your duties until further notice.
- Yes, sir.
- You' il be lucky if I don' t put you in...... for a court- martial.
- He was dirty, Bill.
- He' s dead, Tom!
And don' t think you' re not on my shit- list too.
We found the bunker.
No bodies.
Come on, a hurricane like that could' ve blown them three counties away.
What happens to Dunbar now?
In 10 minutes he gets on a plane, which means you' re done.
You' il understand if I don' t walk you out.
- Strange kid.
- What?
Kendall.
Even while he was dying he was making jokes about infinity.
What?
What?
Dunbar wrote this when he asked for a Ranger.
There' s an 8 on it.
I don' t know.
Okay.
I' il find out by myself.
Stop.
Okay.
FBl?
Not exactly.
- What' s that mean?
- There was a group of guys down here....
There was a group of guys down here who were way out on the hairy edge.
They did covert stuff and they --
They what?
They went renegade.
Dropped off the face of the earth, disappeared into drug land...... and with their special skills cut one hell of a swath through the competition.
West trained some of these guys.
And he hated them for what they did, and they hated him.
- Who knows about this?
How do I know?
They' re ghosts, right?
They' re dead.
None of this could be true.
But the note that that kid wrote...... had an 8 on it.
Section 8.
Section 8?
You mean, like, they' re crazy?
- How could you keep that from me?
- Classified.
You son of a bitch!
Mister, I' ve had it with you!
Okay, so are you happy?
Is that a no?
Ma' am.
Need your signature for this guy' s transport.
Sure thing.
What the hell happened to you two?
None of your business.
Kendall' s dead and you' re going to jail.
ClD' s here to take you to Washington.
Guess I' m on the same transport as Pike.
Hey, Julie- bird, you bitch...... why don' t you go on and get me something to eat?
- What did you say?
No, no, no, before.
What did you say?
What, that me and Pike were on a transport plane going to D. C. together?
You mean Dunbar.
No, Pike.
The one that they just hauled out of here.
The guy that they brought in with Kendall on the chopper.
That was Dunbar.
That' s not right.
What do you mean?
Why not?
Tom...... Ray Dunbar is black.
Son of a bitch did the whole thing!
All he had to do is switch dog tags.
- Hangar Four.
Move it.
Come on, go!
Go!
- Sir!
- What, captain?
- I need to take him back for questioning -- - We' re not finished with you yet, Pike.
Hey!
Hardy, what the fuck are you doing?
- Sir!
We have tried to -- - Come on down, Pike, come on down!
You wanna talk baseball now?
I don' t think so!
What are you gonna do?
- You' re not gonna shoot me!
- You see what happens when you lie?
You got --
Hardy, what are you doing, man?
Stop that!
- Let him go!
- Stand down!
Tom, what the fuck are you doing?!
Stand down, goddamn it!
Well, well, well.
What have we got here?
I told you he knows.
Now, wait.
Knows what?
About the other operation.
What other operation?
The coke.
They were sending pounds of it back to the States, using military supply lines.
Vilmer would hide it in crates of files.
Hell, he' d ship it in a corpse if he had to.
West figured it out about a week ago.
He was gonna go to the colonel.
Kendall and Mueller must' ve decided to take him out of the equation.
You have got to be the dumbest bunch of sons of bitches on God' s green earth.
You think you can ship that shit right under my nose?
Mueller, what are you doing?!
Get his weapon.
Castro, wait!
- Fuck you, let him go!
This ain' t some drive- by!
You think you can kill a man face to face?
- Put it down, Pike!
- He' il fucking shoot you!
You fire, I fire.
You can' t trust him.
Maybe I' il take one or two more of you before you take me.
The odds are in your favor that at least two of you walk out of here alive.
Conversely, there' s absolutely no way I should be able to walk out of this bunker.
This is bullshit!
I' il do it!
So pretty.
So dead.
Kendall, what are you doing?
Kendall!
What, you don' t believe me?
Medical crate 8469846 in Shipping D awaiting transfer.
See for yourself.
Vilmer and whoever his partner was must have been making millions.
Where did the coke come from?
I mean, this is Panama.
Throw a rock in any direction, you' il hit three cartels.
About an hour later, Kendall and I found Dunbar.
Put it down!
Put it down, son.
- I just wanna go!
- Understandable.
Now, put it down.
- Look, I never meant to hurt anybody!
- Let' s keep it that way!
You surrender, I take you in.
I know it sounds like a shitty deal, but you get to live.
I' il go my way, and you go yours, okay?
Not gonna happen!
You either surrender or we die where we stand.
- Sarge!
That' s why I took Dunbar' s dog tags.
Oh, God!
Mueller didn' t die after all.
Came after us with a vengeance.
How' d you get Kendall to go along with switching Dunbar' s dog tags?
I gave him a choice.
How about the bodies?
That hurricane almost lifted me off the ground.
It' s there, just like you said.
So you' il testify to all of this?
I don' t think you' re gonna get any deals.
I don' t want any deals.
I' il take him now, if you don' t mind.
We should' ve died out there with the others.
Did you get what you wanted?
Not even close.
Just that one thing that I wanted to ask you about.
- Say when.
- Yeah, this is Hardy.
Oh, really?
Thank you.
The kid said that West waited till the end of the week to tell the colonel.
Now, why would he wait until the end of the week to tell you?
I mean, that doesn' t sound like the West that we knew.
You think the kid was lying?
No.
I don' t.
- What?
I do.
I think you' re lying.
I do.
And you told Mueller and Kendall to kill him.
Then what did I do, go and poison Kendall?
- Well, who said he was poisoned?
The hospital found out three minutes ago.
- I was on the phone with the pathologist.
- Golly, Tom, the kid was puking blood...... all over the hospital.
You know, gunshot and childbirth just didn' t seem to fit...... so I took a wild- ass fucking guess.
Was that really the pathologist?
No, that was my message service.
Even if it was, does that prove anything?
You keep forgetting...... I don' t have to.
- What?
- I don' t have to prove anything...
-... because it' s not my job.
- I mean, golly, Tom....
I just have to get you to the real guys.
One- third.
You' ve never met a bribe you didn' t like.
Oh, I see.
I see.
You called me so in case I stumbled upon something...... you' d just buy me off.
Crossed my mind.
Like I said, they were never gonna make me a general anyway.
This is about quality of life.
Tom, you' ve had a hell of a run of bad luck.
Bounced out of the Army...... hanging by a thread at the DEA.
You' re gonna wind up a fucking process server.
If you lose enough times, what you are is a loser.
Forty percent.
Once I' m up and running again.
Up and running again?
This is just a hiccup.
I can get another three, four months before they close the place down.
I' il have to think about that.
And then I saw the gun and then he drew it...... so I had no choice but to fire.
Three, maybe.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Now what?
I' m gonna go home and get drunk and try to forget all of this.
Well, in that case...... there you go.
Yeah, I thought maybe later I' d slip by and we' d do the old --
It' s just in case you need me to testify about the shooting.
But you don' t worry, they' il clear you on that.
He was your friend.
Yeah, but he was a lot of other things too.
Besides, my friends don' t betray their country.
Tuesday?
Tuesday, pick me up at 7?
Tuesday at 7.
You' re one of the good ones, Osborne.
I don' t want you to worry about what happened.
All we gotta do is tell the story right.
All we gotta do is tell the story right.
And we can be the men that took down our sergeant' s killers.
- Tell the story right.
-- friends in low places.
-- wasn' t even his real name.
Pike wasn' t even his real --
They' re ghosts.
And they hated him.
I wanted him dead -- I wanted him dead --
I am your objective, right?
Osborne?
If you don' t like the music, just say so.
Don' t move.
Put your hands on the table.
Who are they?
They are my colleagues.
And they' re discussing breakfast recipes.
- You knew about the coke.
- Yes, I did.
You knew about Vilmer.
You knew about Styles.
In fact, they work for you, because you' re Section 8.
You planned all this.
And you killed West.
Give me one good reason why I should not fucking blow your head off right now.
Tom?
Why did this young woman have a weapon pointed at your head?
This is Captain Osborne, and she has had a long day.
Oh, I' il bet it was something you said.
She thinks I killed you.
He didn' t.
I thought you hated each other.
I' m not particularly fond of him, and he is sort of a jerk, but what can you do?
- Slack?
Did he say "slack"?
Sit, it' s safe.
You wanna talk about slack?
You take a simple find- out - who' s- working- for- who operation...... next thing I know, there' s corpses flopping around like it' s raining fish.
- Yeah, but I rescued your ass.
- Did my ass need rescuing?
- Don' t put me in this.
You stumble upon a drug operation...... in the middle of 1 0, 000 heavily armed men...... and you didn' t have to be pulled out?
See now, that' s different.
I was going to retire early anyway.
So you found out about the coke and you told Styles?
Yeah, who did nothing.
Except order Kendall and Mueller to kill you.
And you figured that they were gonna do it in the jungle.
Breakfast is ready!
Do you remember the triplets?
- This is hotter.
- This might eat me!
Captain.
Dunbar.
- Oh, actually it' s neither, ma' am.
- Right.
- So you' re not Nunez.
I' m afraid I' m not.
Right.
You' re all dead.
Well, you could refer to it as bureaucratic absence of presence.
But we' re not here.
I mean dead.
You are on it today!
What are you laughing at?
The idea that you just transferred into his unit.
I just transferred to Arlington Cemetery.
You keep talking shit and you' re liable to make roll call.
- So you' re all Section 8?
- I told you she was smart.
What did he say she was?
- Hot.
- Hot.
We' re officially Section 8.
And what about the story about you guys being all...
- More like ragamuffins.
That' s been our unit' s cover story since the beginning, ma' am.
And it' s a story that scares the frijoles out of the Colombians.
Okay, so now that I know all this, what happens?
I get a needle in my arm and wake up tomorrow morning with no memory?
Isn' t that what you guys do?
We actually thought you handled yourself quite well in this situation.
We were gonna offer you a job.
Did she tell you the story about the carnival last night?
- Shit.
- What do you want to know?
- Miss Festival Party Lady.
What do you wanna know?
Don' t act like you weren' t all over this man.
Yeah, tell him the truth.
So, what are you gonna do?
I think I need a beer.
Here you go, colonel.
Colonel?
Los Angeles Tower, this is Transworld 22 Heavy.
We are going down!
Repeat, engines two and...
Mayday!
Andrew, this is your father.
Hello?
Look, you don' t call me back, so I don' t know how to do this.
If you' re not gonna return my calls... then there' s no way for us to communicate...
Look, I don' t know how to do this... but you' re gonna need to come home now.
Last night...
Your mother died last night, Andrew.
She drowned.
Last night, she drowned in the bath.
Ten résumés just today.
They come in every day from Idaho or Milwaukee or Florida.
And you know what they want even more than a guest spot on Everybody Loves Raymond?
They want your job.
This will never happen again.
You are 30 minutes late.
Todd Slauson from Duluth, Minnesota.
Sparkling or flat?
Waiter 10, do you have your earpiece in?
You forget the order 41 for Table 101.
What, are you on break?
Nah, I' m just messin' with you.
Uh, we' il have four Ketel Red Bulls and...
And I' il have a Ketel cosmo with a Red Bull and some bread ASAP.
We don' t have bread.
How can you not have bread?
Uh, we' re a Vietnamese restaurant.
We just don' t have bread.
But you' re not Vietnamese.
No, I' m not.
Can I have something to chew on?
Fuck.
Bamboo, whatever.
I' il see what I can find.
Flight Number 121 with nonstop service... to Newark International will be departing from Gate 32.
Shit, yo.
Holy shit.
What' s up, man?
Largeman, what are you doing here?
Uh, that' s my mom.
Yeah.
So, welcome back home.
Thanks.
So what have you been doing?
You still, uh, acting and shit, right?
- L- In L. A., right?
- Yeah.
- That' s cool.
I hear that place is, like, fucking crazy.
My cousin' s a writer out there.
Says that place is mad crazy.
He' s, like, writing a movie about snowboarders or some shit.
I don' t know.
Um, but I should introduce you to him, Largeman.
Maybe you two could do something together.
Yeah, definitely.
What are you doing tonight, man?
Uh, nothing.
No real plans.
I' m just in town for a couple days, so...
You should come out with us.
We' re gonna go over the Gleasons' house.
They' re having some... fucking huge party or something.
- Supposedly.
Supposedly.
- Really?
- He lives up on the hill.
We' il probably go over there after we bury your mom.
- Same.
Do you know your mother redid the hallway bathroom?
What?
I' m sorry.
Since I met her, she never showed an interest in anything.
All of a sudden, a month ago, she wakes up... she wants to redecorate a bathroom.
I helped her.
- Oh, must have been fun.
- Well, I sew.
It' s a shirt.
Thank you.
Will you try it on now?
Now?
In case I have to fix it before you leave again... and we don' t see you for another nine years.
I wanna make sure it fits.
You' re gonna love the material.
I used the leftovers from your mother' s design.
Gorgeous.
- How you doing?
"Well, besides that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show?"
You know, I' m not really sure what to say here, Dad, so I' m sorry.
Mm.
How are you?
I' m okay.
I' ve been getting these really bad headaches though.
09: 12 2004- 12- 15129
It' s like a... just a little lightning storm in my head.
Just for a second, and then it' s gone.
I just thought maybe you could help me get that checked out while I' m home.
Go see Dr. Cohen first thing in the morning.
He' s a neurologist in my building.
He' il fit you in.
I' m sure it' s nothing to worry about.
Place looks good.
Oh, that' s nice.
Yeah, we' ve been doing a lot of work on it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I don' t know why I just said that.
Someone redid the, uh, hallway bathroom.
That' s new.
I' m glad you' re here.
Saying good- bye is important.
I' m glad you could fit it in.
- Put your hands on your head, please.
I said put your motherfucking hands on your head!
Please.
Eighty- two in a 25.
What are you gonna tell me, you' re late or just tired?
- I was...
- Shut the fuck up!
- Largeman.
- Kenny?
Holy shit!
Oh, man.
How you doing?
I' m great.
- Your mom just died!
- Yeah.
You' re a cop, Kenny?
- Yeah, I know.
I don' t know.
Couldn' t think of anything better to do.
No, but it' s really cool though, man.
People really listen to you.
I mean... they have to!
- Yo, and check this shit out.
That' s the safety.
And plus, the benefits, man.
If I get shot, I' m like... rich!
But, Kenny, the last time I saw you, you were doing coke lines off a urinal.
No, I had to grow up, man.
Plus, I wasn' t making shit in that fish market.
No one knew who I was, couldn' t get laid.
It' s a much better situation for me, man.
Speaking of which, um, how' d I do?
What do you mean?
I don' t know.
You know, just the whole...
You mean, like, as a cop?
The whole, "Shut the fuck up!"
Well, I thought you were a dick, so I guess that' s good.
Nice.
So, what the fuck, man?
You' re this huge movie star now?
I heard you did some... you played a big football player or something.
- It was just this thing...
- Fucking De Niro and shit.
- He' s awesome.
- Deer Hunter?
- Yeah.
Man, we should sit down and we should talk... because I' ve got some really good ideas for movies.
- Stories from the Force.
- Yeah.
Yeah, definitely.
- Holy shit!
- What' s up?
- How you doing, man?
- How you doing, man?
- Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you.
This guy does not wait for a beer.
He' s a movie star.
Like, uh, Jersey' s De Niro and shit.
- Largeman, man, what are you doing home?
- I, uh...
Fuck, yeah!
Serpico and shit.
"Attica!"
Shut the fuck up, man.
You like that?
Like, uh, "press junket"?
That' s improv, bitch.
Right?
Let me show you something.
Oh, whoa!
What' s going on, man?
How you been?
How are you, brother?
- How' s it going, man?
I heard you' re kicking ass.
Oh, um, basically the man bought my silent Velcro patent.
- What?
- I developed this little item.
It' s just like Velcro, but it doesn' t make that... the Velcro noise.
- So how much did they buy it for?
- A lot, man.
So wh- what are you doing with yourself?
Um, nothing.
I' ve never been so bored in my whole life.
First month I went out.
I bought a whole bunch of shit.
But, y...
Nothing.
Someone got a joint for me?
Oh.
No, thanks, man.
I thought you were a big movie star and shit.
- Well, then here.
Eat this.
Welcome home.
I guess I' il see you guys later.
Should we play a game?
Let' s play "spin the bottle."
I' m not playing "spin the bottle."
How old are we?
- Or more importantly, how old are they?
- Oh, they' re all legal.
I think.
Well, wejust ate all this fucking "X," so what the hell else are we supposed to do?
Girl has a point.
- Fucking right.
- I' m in!
- Largeman, this is Dana.
- Hi.
Hi.
This is gonna be a good night.
It' s good, isn' t it?
I always try to save a couple of the marshmallows till the very end... but I never make it.
I always end up with... a bunch of flake things and pink milk.
My mind wanders.
So, Tim...
How long have you been working at Medieval Times?
B- But I' ve only been a knight for two.
You have to pay your dues.
I worked in the stables and helped in the kitchen.
When I started, he was making the coleslaw.
It hasn' t been the same since you got knighted.
But I really just stirred it.
Don' t be modest.
Mr. Modesty won the joust last night.
- It' s not that big a deal.
What was it that happened to you in high school?
You had a thing.
- He got the shit kicked out of him.
- No, he didn' t.
How do you know?
He got the shit kicked out of him by Tyrell Freedmen.
- He knocked your teeth out.
He only chipped one tooth.
So, uh, w- what are you up to now, Mark?
You' re digging graves?
Mark' s getting into real estate.
- Tim can speak Klingon.
- No, I can' t.
- Yes, you can.
- What the fuck is Klingon?
- Yeah, he can speak their language.
- No, she' s kidding.
Why are you being shy?
- Yeah, don' t be shy, Tim.
- It' s just...
This guy who plays the wizard at work is a Trekkie.
- Don' t be shy.
Tell them what you said to me last night.
Say what you said to her last night.
You gotta be kidding me.
It means, "I like to mate after battle."
- That' s not what I said.
- Yeah.
No.
That wasn' t the one I said.
This one means, "Kill Kirk"... and also "Hallelujah," depending on the context.
You must have got it confused with, uh...
- Honey, that is good.
- You know what that means, Tim?
Well, I do.
It means, "Get the fuck out of my house... before I chop your fucking head off."
Mark, he' s a knight.
He' s just a fast- food knight.
I should get going.
Thanks, uh, for the cereal.
I had a lovely evening.
By the way, it says "balls" on your face.
- Asshole.
- My mom did it.
In the spring... the hungry gator must find new and clever ways to find food.
Did you tell Large about... the tapes?
I' m not doing those stupid tapes.
- What are the tapes?
You can make up to $100, 000 your first year.
You should have seen the boat this Oriental guy had.
He even had his own game show in China, he had so much money.
I think Mark would be perfect at it.
Okay?
Well, I' m doing it.
I' m saving up for those tapes.
Because I know what you could be if you just apply yourself.
I do apply myself every day, Mom.
I work my ass off burying dead people.
I' m only 26.
I' m not in any rush.
Just let me be.
I don' t rush you.
Then I' il do 'em myself.
Fine.
Okay, then I won' t let you on my yacht.
Large, you can come anytime you want.
Just don' t bring your friend here.
I got to go to my meeting.
Okay.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- Large, it was nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.
Oh, you guys, don' t stay in here all day...
'cause I took the batteries out of the carbon monoxide detector.
It was beeping all night.
She drives me crazy!
She gets all baked out and makes me feel like I have to impress her.
And you know what?
I' m okay with being unimpressive.
- Hey, what time is it?
I gotta go.
Hi, I' m Andrew Largeman.
I' m sorry.
- I' m really late for my appointment.
Andrew.
I' m gonna need you to fill out this paperwork for me.
As soon as we' re ready, we' il call you in.
I' m sorry.
Have a seat.
- Hello, Miss Lubin.
- Oh, hello there.
Just have a seat.
We' il be with you soon, okay?
- Thank you.
How' s it going?
Get off.
Heel.
Got any suggestions?
Oh, what?
- You got any suggestions?
Kick his balls.
Yeah, but I don' t wanna destroy future generations of charitable dogs.
Don' t worry about it.
If I didn' t kick them in the balls regularly, I' d never get anything done.
But he' s gotta be close to finishing by now.
Not yet.
Here comes the lipstick.
We' re ready for you now.
Okay.
I feel so used.
For, at least, your good intentions.
- I recognize you.
- Oh, did you go to Columbia High?
From TV.
- Didn' t you play the retarded quarterback?
Are you really retarded?
No, I' m not.
Cool.
I mean, I thought you were really retarded.
You' re just as good as that Corky kid, and he' s actually retarded.
If there was some sort of retarded Oscar... you would win like hands down, kick his ass.
Well, thank you.
I have to fill out this form though, so...
- Right on.
My cousin' s an actor.
Jake Ryan Winters.
He was, like, on Xena once as a gnome or something.
That' s really cool though.
Thanks.
Oh, my God.
That scene.
That last scene... where you give the speech to the whole stadium... and your dad... oh, your dad gives you the thumbs up.
That was emotional.
So, you got anything else coming out?
You know, I' m auditioning...
I can' t believe you' re not really retarded.
You can' t really tell on Xena 'cause he' s in the hairy gnome suit... but when we were little, he used to put on these really, really low- budge... renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals in our attic.
And they were awful!
Like, so bad.
It sucks, though, because there' s not that much work for little people, you know?
Anyway, I' m talking too much.
You got to fill out your forms.
What are you listening to?
The Shins.
- You know them?
- No.
It' il change your life.
I swear.
You gotta fill out your forms.
Think you could, uh...
- maybe listen while you fill out your forms?
- I think I can handle it.
It' s good.
- So, what are you here for?
You?
I, uh...
Oh, fuck, that was nosy.
I didn' t...
I didn' t mean to be.
I' m sorry.
I get these headaches.
Cool.
- Andrew Largeman?
- We' re ready for you now.
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you.
Nice meeting you.
Andrew.
Nice to meet you.
Good luck with your head.
Thanks.
Don' t worry, Sam.
- Mr. Andrew Largeman?
- Yes, hi.
- There' s absolutely nothing wrong with you.
- What?
I' m Dr. Cohen.
What can we do for you today, Andrew.
Um, I' ve been getting these really intense headaches.
Um, they last for like a split second.
It' s like lightning, like a surge of electricity, and then it' s gone.
Lithium?
How long have you been on the lithium?
Um, I' ve been on some form of it since I was 10 or so.
And the Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa...
Depakote... did they, uh, help you at all?
No.
I mean, I don' t know.
It' s recently occurred to me I might not even have a problem.
Only, I' d never know it because as far back as I can remember, I' ve been medicated.
I left them in L. A. Though.
This is, uh, the first time I haven' t had medicine in my body for... a long time.
You know that stuff will leave your body pretty fast.
- I can write you a prescription.
- Actually, I was thinking about taking a little vacation.
Uh, well, my psychiatrist is my dad.
So I think he' d prefer me to stay on it.
He... likes to think it makes me happy.
You know, our bodies are capable of doing some very funny things... when they' re consumed with stress and anxiety.
I found my ex- best friend' s cuff links in my wife' s purse.
I couldn' t get an erection for a year and a half... for example.
But I don' t really think that' s it because I don' t...
I don' t really feel like stressed or anxious at all.
'Cause all the lithium he' s had you on.
Look, Andrew, uh, first of all...
I think you do need to find a psychiatrist that isn' t your father.
That' s something that should have been remedied years ago.
And secondly, uh, I' m in no position to comment on... whether you should stay on the meds or not because I don' t know your story.
But my opinion, since you' re paying for it... is that, yeah, those drugs may help you as a means to an end... but sooner or later, if you' re not in some sort of therapy... whatever' s going on in your mind will find a way to peek its little head out of the water.
- Are you all right?
Yeah, you' re all right.
You' re alive.
Come on.
I' il take a look at you.
I' il need you to take your shoes off.
So why were you really there?
I' m a robot.
- Do you lie a lot?
- What do you consider a lot?
Enough for people to call you a liar.
- People call me lots of things.
I could say no, but how would you know I' m not lyin '?
I guess I could choose to trust you.
- You can do that?
Whose bike is that?
It was my grandfather' s.
It was the only thing he left to anyone in my family, and he left it to me.
So this is the point in the conversation where you ask me if I' d like a ride home.
- It is?
Would you like a ride home?
But I' m not getting in that sidecar.
- Why not?
Anyone who rides in that is automatically your bitch.
Thus, I will ride on the back.
- Whoa.
Okay.
My hair is blowin 'in the wind.
What, are you like a hang glider?
My boyfriend was gonna pick me up so I brought it.
- What does he have?
One of those tandem things?
He drives a Ninja.
Goes way faster than this guy.
- But what kind of helmet is that?
- You can wear it on a bike.
- Anyway, how' s your head?
- I should live through the day.
Cool.
Are you doing anything right now?
- I know this guy, Jesse.
He bought this mansion that' s right up here... and he wants me to come visit him.
I was thinking, like if you came too...
That' s pretty damn random of you, Andrew.
- "Nice to meet you.
- No.
- It' s the Hollywood in you, I guess.
Come on.
It' il be fun.
I' il tell you what, we can have like...
like a signal.
Like, when you pull on your ear, that' s the code.
And then I' il be like, "Oh, I got to take her home." And then we' il go.
Can we have code names too?
But don' t try and like kidnap me or anything...
'cause my step- uncle' s a bounty hunter and he could have you tracked and killed.
You' re such a liar.
You ready?
I' il be fine.
But, um...
I lied to you before when I told you my boyfriend drives a Ninja.
- No, I don' t have a boyfriend.
But, you know, he might drive a Ninja.
- Wow.
We' re off to a great start.
So sometimes I lie.
I mean, I' m weird, man.
About random stuff too.
It' s like...
It' s like a tic.
"Wow, that wasn' t even remotely true."
So how do people know what' s real?
Well, I always feel bad afterwards and admit them when they' re lies.
Can you trust that?
Open the door.
Kevin, down.
Kick him in the balls.
Kick him in the balls.
Mom!
Everybody down!
Do you want to eat?
Then get the fuck off him.
Get off!
I' m so sorry.
Wejust don' t have the time to train them.
Who' s got the time to train them?
- Mom, this is Andrew.
Welcome.
I' m sorry the place is a wreck.
Honey, I asked you to get the metal wheel out of the hamster cage.
- I forgot.
- Well, you forgot and now Jelly' s dead.
We have to get the only hamsters on planet Earth... who can' t figure out a stupid hamster wheel.
There' s a tin box on the kitchen counter.
You can do the honors.
- It' s nice to meet you.
- Yes.
Very nice to meet you.
So this is it.
- It' s nice.
Don' t say that just 'cause you can' t think of anything else.
I' m not.
It' s very cozy.
When it got to be fall again... we figured, "Just leave it up."
You' re totally freaked out.
- You, like, can' t wait to leave.
- I' m not.
I like it.
- Well, you wanna see my room?
Sure.
- Hey.
Titembay, this is my friend Andrew.
Andrew, this is my brother, Titembay.
It' s very nice to meet you.
- Oh, it' s nice to meet you.
- I' m sorry aboutJelly.
I saved some mac and cheese for you.
It' s in the fridge.
Anyway, I' m late for class.
It' s nice meeting you.
- See you later.
So here we are.
It' s nothing fancy, but you know...
Uh, it' s...
Titembay, right?
Yeah, it' s weird, huh?
You' re, like, so freaked out right now.
You' re running for the door.
You can go.
It' s really...
- Stop doing that.
I wanna be here.
Trust me, my family is way more fucked up than yours.
Okay?
Okay.
So, Titembay.
- Yeah, he' s my brother.
- Is he adopted or...
My mom adopted him from Sally Struthers like years ago.
One of those "For the cost of a cup of coffee a day" sort of things.
Where she' s like, "How can you just sit there and not help the children?"
So we start sending him like pictures and letters and stuff for years... but then I got really into ice- skating, so we sort of forgot about him.
Then one day we get this phone call and it' s Titembay.
And he' s at the dry cleaners around the corner.
I live in the dorms... but I' m used to living with my tribe so I' d rather live with a family. "
Wow.
He' s the most amazing guy.
He struggled through so much because he wanted to learn.
When I think of what he' s accomplished, I just...
He' s studying criminal justice at Rutgers, and when he was a baby... he was one of those kids with, like, the flies all over his face.
Wow.
I mean, i- it' s a crazy story.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, that' s a true story.
This is Tickle.
- What is Tickle?
- Tickle' s my favorite thing in the whole world.
It' s all that' s left of Nanny, my blanket.
- Mm- hmm.
- Was there like a hurricane or something?
No, I mean, I' ve had this since I was a baby.
It' s what they brought me home in from the hospital.
- It' s like the Wailing Wall.
Uh, the Wailing Wall is like this, uh...
It' s like the most holy place forJews to go and pray in Israel.
It' s all that' s left of this enormous temple that was destroyed by the Romans.
So you' re like reallyJewish.
- You are, aren' t you?
- No, I' m not.
L- I' m Jewish, but I' m not reallyJewish.
I don' t do anything Jewish.
I don' t go to temple or anything.
TheJews I know, they go on one day.
- It' s Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance.
Did you know that most temples are built with moveable walls... so that on the one day of the year when everyone comes to repent... they can actually make the room big enough to hold everyone?
I don' t really believe in God.
- Just Tickle.
- We' re not gonna make out or anything.
I just totally ruined that moment, didn' t I?
- No, no.
- It' s just that we' re not gonna make out, okay?
- Oh, no, I hadn' t planned on trying...
I am so lame.
I' m sorry.
I am...
- You know what I do when I feel completely unoriginal?
And then I can feel unique again even if it' s only for like a second.
So, no one' s ever done that?
You just witnessed a completely original moment in history.
- It' s refreshing.
You should try it.
- No, come on.
- I think that was good enough for both of us.
Come on.
This is your one opportunity to do something... that no one has done before and that no one will copy again throughout human existence.
A- And if nothing else, you' il be remembered as the one guy who ever did this.
How was that?
So, uh...
Wanna help?
- Yeah.
- I mean, this is, uh...
It' s not that we' re bad pet owners or anything.
It' s just, you know, we' ve had so many of them over the years.
After you.
All right.
Sit down.
What are you thinking about?
- Now?
- Right now?
Right now, I was thinking I' ve been going to a lot of these things lately.
- What, dates?
- Not dates.
Is this a date?
This isn' t a date.
Funerals.
Oh, uh...
That' s why I' m home actually.
My mom just died.
God, that' s weird to say that out loud, but, uh...
My mom just died.
And, uh...
Yeah, that' s why I' m home.
I' m so sorry.
God, I' m so sorry.
And here I am, like, putting you through another one of these.
Not thatJelly' s like anywhere near your mom' s.
I mean, we loved Jelly but...
I' m so sorry.
No, it' s okay.
It' s all right.
I' m all right with it.
Anyway, I think it' s what she wanted, so...
She drowned actually.
Yeah, my, uh...
She was in a wheelchair so she, uh...
I guess she was taking a bath... and she must have slipped or something.
That' s what they say.
I don' t know.
But... needless to say, she drowned and... that' s how she... sh- she died.
This was, uh...
Oh, my God.
Why are you crying?
I don' t know.
I' m not usually like this.
It' s just like...
It' s just so sad.
You know, it' s like...
It' s like...
It' s like real life tragedy or something.
Anyway, let' s change the subject, okay?
'cause what could be ruder than talking about someone else who died... when you' re in the act of burying a close friend?
- Well, what should we do?
- I don' t know.
I' ve only been to one of these things.
You appear to be the expert.
Okay, uh, I' il go first.
Didn' t really know you, Jelly.
- Little trouble with the wheel but...
- That' s not funny.
Jelly, you were a great pet.
I' m sorry I forgot to take the wheel out of your cage.
Good- bye.
I hope that you liked me.
Holy shit!
You scared the shit out of me.
- Why are you always doing that?
I know.
I' ve been catching up with people around here.
Dr. Cohen called.
Yeah, I think I' m starting to figure that out myself.
- When are you thinking of leaving?
Um, you know, I got a lot of stuff I got to take care of in L. A.
- Probably have to find a newjob, so...
- We need to talk.
Yeah, uh, how?
What are you doing... now?
Uh, now' s not so good.
I told my friend Mark I was gonna meet up with him.
- Okay.
Then we' il talk.
We owe that to each other.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sorry I scared you.
How could you leave all that lithium?
I was totally going to hit you up for some, man.
This fucking guy.
I' m glad you' re back, man.
This town is so messed up.
Everyone' s got their drug of choice.
It' s like in Brave New World.
You ever read that book?
Who wrote that?
Um, Aldous...
Aldous something.
Aldous, uh...
Anyway... there' s like Alphas and Betas and Epsilons and all sorts of people.
Huxtable.
Aldous Huxtable.
- Mom, no.
- Absolutely.
She was so ahead of her time.
She could have gone to the Olympics.
No, no, no, no.
I couldn' t have.
Yes, you could have.
Don' t blame it on the epilepsy.
- You had a gift.
- Come on.
Let' s just show him the "Florida Stars of the Ice" opening.
- Mom, I' m asking you, seriously.
- Come on.
Let me see it!
Oh, she wants you to see it.
How could you not want him to see how talented you are?
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Ohh!
- I' m dusting for prints.
Well, could we move the crime scene into the kitchen?
I want to show Andrew Sam' s skating.
But someone' s been pissing on my GameCube, and I' m about to close the case.
It wasn' t me, Your Honor.
The paw prints point to a canine.
Andrew, come on.
Sit down here on the couch.
I can' t believe you' re actually showing him this.
Look, there she is.
- You' re the alligator?
- You can tell by the hands.
- Here comes the double axel.
- Land!
Oh, I mean, come on.
- Wow, she' s great.
- Wow.
- Shut up.
- No, I mean, your mom was right.
You' re really good.
- All right.
- Mom, come on!
My baby!
Go on.
Get away.
Wait a minute.
Gimme a hug.
I love you so much.
I' m so proud of you.
- I love you too.
- Have a good night.
- Thanks for dinner.
You' re giving me a hug too.
Come on.
- I' il take a hug.
See you later, Tim.
- Bye, Tim.
Peace out, player.
Pretending to be someone else.
That is not funny.
You gotta see that' s a joke.
If you can' t laugh at yourself, life' s gonna seem a whole lot longer than you' d like.
All right, so what are we laughing at you about?
Mm.
- I have epilepsy.
- Which part are we laughing about?
I, um...
I had a seizure at the law office where I work.
And they told me their insurance wouldn' t cover me unless I wore preventative covering.
- What' s preventative covering?
Oh, come on!
That' s funny.
That' s really funny.
Well, what do you do?
What do you do?
You laugh, you know?
I' m not saying I don' t cry.
But in- between, I laugh.
Plus, I look forward to a good cry.
Feels pretty good.
I haven' t cried since I was a little kid.
I tried, you know?
I thought of all the saddest things I could think of.
Like, things in movies, this...
There' s this image from Life magazine that' s always haunted me.
But nothing came.
That actually made me sadder than anything... the fact that I just felt so numb.
- Just that...
Hey, Vagina!
Hey, what' s up, guys?
- Hey.
- What' s up?
Hey, nice to meet you.
I' m sorry I said "vagina" just now.
- Oh, that' s okay.
Nice.
Let' s get fucked up.
Whoo!
- Largeman, get the fuck in the pool!
It' s so warm!
Of course I can swim.
I don' t know C. P. R.
You look like a wet beaver.
There' s a handful of normal kid things I kind of missed.
There' s a handful of normal kid things I kind of wish I' d missed.
You know that point in your life when you realize the house you grew up in... isn' t really your home anymore.
All of a sudden, even though you have some place where you put your shit... that idea of home is gone.
I still feel at home in my house.
Just sorta happens one day, and it' s gone.
You feel like you can never get it back.
It' s like you feel homesick for a place that doesn' t even exist.
Maybe it' s like this rite of passage, you know?
For your kids.
For the family you start.
It' s like a cycle or something.
But I miss the idea of it, you know?
A group of people that miss the same imaginary place.
Maybe.
How about some fuckin 'furniture, dude?
- Where is it?
- It' s keeping us warm.
You lucky motherfucker.
I feel like if I had showed up at school and presented the idea of silent Velcro... they would have sent me away a whole lot sooner.
Listen to this girl.
- They didn' t "send me away."
- You just said they sent you away.
I mean, they sent me away.
They sent me to boarding school.
"Sent me away" sounds like I went to some asylum or something.
- There were no straps involved.
- Why did they send you to boarding school?
"Oh, are you freaked out?
- You can go.
Don' t feel bad. "
- That' s really funny.
It' s really funny.
Why would they think you' d be dangerous?
- Want to know?
- Yeah.
You' re gay.
Drumroll.
I was the reason she was in a wheelchair.
I pushed her.
So there that is.
- Fuck off.
- No.
- Why?
It was just a complete freak accident, you know?
It' s one of those things you replay a million times in your head... and you see how clearly it was just a complete freak thing.
My- My whole life, she was depressed for no reason.
I was a little kid.
I pushed her.
I was just completely frustrated.
- 'Cause you couldn' t make her happy?
Fuck, yeah!
And any other time, you know... any other day, she would havejust yelled at me and sent me to my room.
But this day... on this particular day... the door of the dishwasher... had fallen open... the latch on it was broken.
And it would just randomly fall open.
That fuckin 'latch, you know.
But...
So, anyway, she, uh... she fell back over the door... and, uh, hit her neck on the kitchen counter, paralyzing her from the waist down.
- Still want to compare fucked- up families?
Yeah.
Well, I was nine.
So they sent me to therapy and put me on these drugs... that were supposed to "curb my anger," and I' ve been on some form of them ever since.
And when I was 16, my psychiatrist dad came around to the conclusion that... it probably wasn' t the best environment for me to be growing up in, so... he sent me to boarding school.
- Until now.
- For her funeral.
- Till now for her funeral.
I can' t believe the retarded quarterback' s a pill- popper.
- Jesse?
- I' il show her.
- No, I- I got it.
- No, you get her a towel.
Wait.
Want a ride, sweetheart?
You' re in it right now, aren' t you?
- My mom always says that when she can see...
I' m, like, working something out in my head, she' s like, "You' re in it right now."
And I' m lookin 'at you, and you' re... telling me that story, and... you' re definitely in it right now.
I am in it.
Let' s just...
- Good stuff?
- Yeah, like "glass half- full" shit.
- What do you got?
Got that.
- What you got?
- I got a little buzz goin '.
And I like you.
I guess I have that.
You want to see me tap- dance?
I would love to see you tap- dance.
- What are you doing?
Fuck yeah.
Those things are collector' s items, man.
You have any idea how much those things are gonna be worth one day?
- Hell, yeah.
That' s just like an investment.
I have lots of little investments all over the place.
One day I' m gonna sell all of' em just fuckin 'live off of it.
- Which?
- "Night Vision Goggles."
Mint?
- Dollars?
- Yeah.
It' s too early.
You don' t sell 'em yet.
Don' t you know anything about investing?
I' m gonna live off that shit.
If you have a complete set, it' s worth, like, thousands.
- Almost.
The corners are bent on my "Friendly Fire," and someone stole my "Wolf Blitzer."
Now, look.
'Cause, uh...
I got you a little going- away present... but, uh, I gotta kind of track it down first.
- Uh, yeah.
I just, uh...
- What?
- No, nothin '.
I just, uh...
Say it.
Speak.
- She can come.
I don' t care.
I really don' t want to be in Handi- World.
We' re getting money for your present.
Don' t look so guilty.
- Andrew Largeman?
- Oh, no.
Benson.
- Oh, no.
- Who is that?
- Just don' t give him your number.
- Holy shit!
- How' s it goin '?
- I haven' t seen you since, like, junior year.
- I thought you killed yourself.
- What?
- No, no.
That wasn' t me.
- That was the Gleason kid.
- Oh, and Tina.
- Tina who?
- You remember Tina.
- She was anorexic, did gymnastics...
- How' d she do it?
- I don' t know.
She wasn' tJewish.
I think it was sleeping pills.
Or that car in the garage thing.
I forgot.
- Uh, sorry, this is Sam, Karl.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Uh, you two stay here.
I' il be right back.
Okay.
- Hey, weren' t you on a TV show or something?
- Yeah, it was just this show.
That' s cool.
Only for a little while.
I' m opening my own business.
Actually, I should talk to you about it.
I' m lookin 'for smart people like you, Large.
- I should get your number.
That' d be...
That' d be cool.
I' d like to talk to you... both... about a good opportunity for you and your loved ones.
I know I do!
I' d like to talk to you about an exciting opportunity that people are talking about.
- Oh, okay.
It was good to see you, Karl.
- Hey, I should get your number.
- Yeah, definitely.
Well, I' il call you because I think he has it in his book.
Nice to meet you.
Why is it always the losers that get caught up in the pyramid schemes?
Why can' t it be some charming, hot girl nagging you incessantly to buy some shit?
- Yeah.
It' s detergent or some shit.
I don' t need knives.
- I' d like to return these.
- You got a receipt?
- Actually, no.
They' re a gift.
- Why are you returning these?
- They' re not sharp enough.
No.
Not for what we need them for.
- They couldn' t cut cans.
- You bought them to cut cans?
No, but in the commercial, it said if I wanted to cut cans, I could.
- With these knives, I can' t.
- It comes with a sharpener.
- Yeah.
They' re just...
- I don' t want them.
- Okay.
A major loophole in the Handi- World return policy is that they permit returns... without receipts on items below $40.
So, how often do you go?
I hit every employee once, and then I wait until they hire new ones.
- Except for Karl Benson.
- You know, Mark, it' s my last day in town.
- I don' t need your money.
- I' m making my own right now.
The guy' s a millionaire.
I don' t take anybody' s money.
Okay, Andrew?
Favors are bad news.
Okay?
Let' s go.
I gotta see a guy about a nitrous tank.
- What is this place?
I think you can see into the hotel rooms.
Oh, yeah!
I' m gonna fuckin' cum!
That shit was hot.
I gotta go drop some knowledge on that ho right there.
How do you know she' s a hooker?
Of course she' s a fuckin 'hooker.
Girls who look like her do not fuck guys that look like him... unless it' s for coke, money or fame.
Well, Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett.
- This is Sam.
No offense, man.
But why are you bringing these fuckin 'people here?
Wait.
Okay?
- Could you just tell us where to go now?
- That thing come with balloons?
What am I, a fuckin 'birthday clown?
Suck it off the tap.
And I need it back when you' re done...
- All right.
Hold up!
Who here just saw some titties?
Raise you hand if you just saw some titties.
Thank you!
So everybody just calm the fuck down!
You know where Kiernan' s Quarry is?
- Yeah.
It' s at the bottom of Hillside and Rivington.
You can' t really see it from the street, but it' s there.
Park your car at the gate and hop the fence.
Albert.
All right?
I' il call him right now and tell him to expect you.
What the fuck are we doin '?
- Just be patient, man.
- We' ve been patient all day... but it' s my last day and you haven' t told us what we' re doin '.
If you told me we were going on a six- hour hunt for blow, I would' ve passed.
We would have been rolling five hours ago.
I think we corrupted this innocent girl enough.
- Yes, you are!
All right?
That' s what I like about you.
I don' t want this guy taking you to, like, some sketchy quarry... in the middle of nowhere to find, like, crack whores huffing turpentine... or pit bulls raping each other or whatever it is you have us doing!
Wow.
That' s like the most worked- up I' ve ever seen you.
- So?
- He likes me.
- Don' t be cute.
He' s my knight in shining armor.
It' s a sore subject.
- Pun intended?
Oh, you' re fuckin '...
- Wow!
I' ve heard about it.
Yeah.
I remember reading about that in the paper, that they were... digging or something, and they break into this natural phenomenon.
It' s like an underground Grand Canyon or something.
Now they' re in some huge legal battle over whether they can build here or not.
Can you imagine the guy whose job it is to fight for his right to build a mall... on some, like, geological phenomenon?
All right.
Let' s find this guy and get out of here.
- You' re not gonna tell us what we' re getting?
You' il see.
I think it' s gonna rain.
So this is it.
So knock!
Knock and barter for Desert Storm trading cards.
I don' t tease you about being an asshole.
Okay!
- Yeah.
Albert?
Come on in.
You guys must be freezing.
Make yourselves warm by the fire.
Okay?
I' il be right back out.
Ah, I must say, I' m continually impressed with how each place you bring us...
- continues to be weirder and weirder.
- What do you mean?
This is nice.
Oh, nothing.
Just hangin 'out on an old boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark.
It' s hardly the bottom, dude.
Did you check out that cliff down there?
This is my wife, Faye.
Hi!
Please.
Have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Man, it' s really comin 'down out there.
- It just started pouring all of a sudden.
- Well... in a bad storm, I like to pretend that this old boat' s my own private ark.
- I' m not quite sure it still floats.
- I' d love some.
Thank you.
Do you want some?
I' il be right back.
What is this place?
What is it that you do down here?
It' s, uh...
No one really knows what it is because we haven' t been able to explore it.
- to make sure no one comes inside.
But what they don' t know is that at night I climb down.
So, how deep does it go?
Thank you.
No one really knows.
But I like to pretend it' s infinite.
- Guardian of an infinite abyss.
Yeah, I guess it is.
But we also trade and deal in antique jewelry.
- No.
- Not at all.
- Never crossed my mind.
Why?
What is it that you think you' re gonna find?
I guess I just like the idea of discovering something.
Of doing something that' s completely unique... that' s never been done before.
- Well, maybe.
Who knows?
But, you know what?
None of that really matters.
If I get to be with this person right here... and our beautiful baby... that' s all I need.
Oh, yeah.
That' d be great.
It took me a while to track this piece down... but I owed Diego huge.
That' s it.
Thank you so much.
- Yeah.
- Really.
Good luck in the rain.
Um, do you guys want some garbage bags or something?
- Yeah.
That' d be great.
Good- bye!
- Yeah?
Good luck exploring the infinite abyss.
Hey!
You too.
So, uh, I don' t know if I' m gonna see you, man.
Don' t you want to know what' s in the bag?
To be honest, I don' t even care anymore.
What is it?
It' s my mom' s favorite necklace.
I' d be lying to you if I told you it was my plan all along.
I got it back to you, right?
That' s gotta be worth something.
This whole day was about this?
You didn' t want it down there with her.
It' s better it' s with you.
Okay.
If you ever need a Kato, you know where to find me.
This, uh...
This necklace reminds me of this really random memory of my mother.
And, uh...
She was just like, you know, cradling me and rocking me back and forth.
And, uh...
And there was just, like, snot dripping down my nose, right?
She gave me her sleeve... and she told me to blow my nose into it.
And I remember thinking, even as a little kid, like...
"Wow!
This is love. "
"This is love."
- Shut up.
- Yeah, I do.
Wait, wait.
We should save it or something.
Okay.
We could put it in my scrapbook, if I had a scrapbook.
- I think so.
I don' t really feel any more coming.
I' il get the cup, okay?
This was such a good idea.
- Who are you?
- I' m your new friend Sam.
Tissue?
Come here.
Yeah, I know.
But that is life.
If nothing else, that' s life, you know.
It' s real.
Sometimes it fuckin 'hurts.
To be honest, it' s sort of all we have.
How are you feelin '?
Safe.
When I' m with you, I feel so safe.
Like I' m home.
Dad.
- I' m sorry I woke you up.
No, I was just reading.
Where have you been?
Everywhere.
Been on sort of a crazy journey these last couple days.
You' ve been avoiding me.
No, I haven' t been.
Okay, maybe I have been.
I' m sure you can find lots of things in your life... that you can be angry about.
But what I do not understand is why you' re so angry at me.
All I ever wanted was for everyone to be happy again.
- That' s all I ever wanted.
- When were we all ever happy, Dad?
You always say that, but when was that?
When was this time that we were all so happy?
'Cause I don' t have it in my memory.
Maybe if I did, I could help steer us back there.
You know, you and I need to work on being okay... if that' s not in the cards for us.
Well, we might have a shot at it... if you can forgive yourself for what you did.
What I did.
Okay, let' s- let' s do it.
Okay, we' re here, right?
I' m gonna forgive myself for what I did.
Are you ready?
That' s what I think.
That' s what I think about the whole thing, okay?
They left me completely fuckin 'numb.
I have felt so fucking numb to everything I have experienced in my life, okay?
For that, I' m here to forgive you.
You always said all you wanted was for us to have whatever it is we wanted.
Maybe what Mom wanted more than anything was for it to all be over.
And for me... what I want more than anything in the world is for it to be okay with you... for me to feel something again.
Even if it' s pain.
That' s a pretty weighty experiment to take on, don' t you think?
This is my life, Dad.
I spent 26 years waiting for something else to start.
So, no, no, I don' t think it' s too much to take on... because it' s everything there is.
I see now it' s all there is.
You and I are going to be okay.
You know that, right?
We may not be as happy as you always dreamed we would be, but...
for the first time, let' s just allow ourselves to be whatever it is we are.
And that' il be better, okay?
I think that' il be better.
What are you thinking about?
- You' re not coming back, are you?
- Of course I am.
- No, you' re not.
You don' t realize this is good.
In your life, you know?
I mean, this...
We can work this stuff out.
I want to help you, you know?
We need each other.
I haven' t even lied in, like, two days.
Is that true?
No.
This isn' t a conversation about this being over.
I' m not puttin 'a period at the end of this, you know?
I' m puttin ', like, an ellipsis on it.
Because I' m- I' m worried that if I don' t go figure myself out... if I don' t go, like, land on my own two feet... then I' m gonna fuck this whole thing up, and this is too important.
L...
I gotta go find a new one.
Look, I' m gonna call you when I get there.
I' m gonna call you.
Look at me.
Look at me.
You changed my life.
You changed my life, and I' ve known you four days.
This is the beginning of something really big.
But right now, I gotta go.
Come here.
Take your seats as quickly as possible.
- What are you doing?
- and then finding you once I figured stuff out?
- The ellipsis?
Yeah.
It' s dumb.
And I' m not gonna do it, okay?
'Cause like you said, this is it.
This is life... and I' m in love with you, Samantha.
I think that' s the only thing I' ve ever been really sure of in my entire life.
But I don' t want to waste any more of my life without you in it, okay?
- Yeah.
- And I think I can do this!
I mean, I want to.
- We have to, right?
- Yeah!
- Right?
- Yes!
So what do we do?
What do we do?
Guys, settle down.
Settle down, you guys.
Who just threw that?
I' il throw something back at you.
No, no more soda, you guys are crazy.
Taxi, taxi!
No, no, I got that.
- It' s okay...
You' re stupid!
That' s just stupid!
Hey, motherfucker!
Where' s the wallet?
<i>Where' s Paul? </ i>
- Maurice?
- Oh shit, Mr. Duncan.
You know this dude?
I had Maurice in my ninth grade bio class about five years ago.
I guess those extra help sessions didn' t quite do it for you.
Let' s go, man.
He' s the best teacher I ever had.
Let' s go.
Sorry about this, Mr. Duncan.
Honest mistake.
<i>Got things under control? </ i>
I ran into an old student, I got held up.
- Mm- hmm, did you get the present?
- Yeah, yeah, voilà.
Gorgeous.
Clara, get the lights.
- Finally.
Ready?
Everybody, everybody!
How you doin ', Jeff?
<i>Where is he? </ i>
- Hey!
- Dad.
<i> # Happy birthday to you # </ i>
How, you doin '?
<i> # Happy birthday to you! # </ i>
- You made me laugh.
- Mars.
- Oh, that' s hilarious.
It' s in the suburbs, a half hour away.
It' s a great offer, but Paul hasn' t made up his mind yet.
I bet that' s a change from the school you teach at now.
Oh yeah, less crack, better cafeteria selection.
He' s still grappling with his conscience.
Mom, Dad, this is the coolest present ever!
Oh- ho, it looks good too, right?
Do you think he needs more sugar?
Yeah I know, I' m breaking every rule.
- Hello, is Steggie in here?
- Beware.
Hey, cake for Steggie.
- He can' t eat that, it...
- Why not?
He' s an herbivore.
Oh, oh, he' s an herbivore.
Okay, then I' il just take it back.
- Wait, maybe leave it, just in case.
- Take it back.
- That' s what I thought.
- Good birthday?
- Yeah.
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.
What was your favorite present?
- My jacket...
- Yay!... You got me.
- You look so good in red.
What' s on your agenda tomorrow?
I have to get a new pair of sneakers for Adam.
I could take care of that right now.
Have you thought about that job offer?
You do realize it' d mean moving, right?
So, we' d move.
You know we used to think we were pretty hip living down here.
I also used to think four Merit Lights and a Diet Coke constituted a meal.
Honey, I love this place as much as you do, but we' ve got a kid to think about.
Plus, you' d be making twice what you' re making now.
I' m just not sure the timing' s right and your photography is starting to take.
This is not about my photography.
I' d be selling out.
Listen... you know how much I respect your ethics.
But this is about Adam.
Sometimes, ethics have to take a back seat.
<i>Okay, your turn. </ i>
- Okay, I' m going to a picnic...
And I' m going to bring an ant, a bagel, a croissant,
- a ding dong...
- Like you?
- Mom!
- A ding dong...
- Uh...
- Shoe store, 3: 00!
- Take my hand.
I think if you pump them any more, they might explode.
Really?
- Kaboom!
- Do you want 'em or not?
- Yeah.
- Do you want this?
- Yeah.
I' m just gonna go test these outside, okay?
Okay, but don' t go too far, okay?
And how would you like to pay for this?
A credit card, please.
I need your signature.
All right, sorry.
- Thanks.
- Great.
<i>Hello! </ i>
You guys!
Where' s my greeting committee?
Jess?
Jessie?
You have four new messages.
Paul, I...
- God be with you.
- Thank you for everything, father.
Honey?
Excuse me, Jessie?
Jessie Duncan?
Yeah?
It' s Richard, Richard Wells.
Richard?
It' s been years.
Actually, Richard, it' s... it' s kind of a bad time.
I know, I read about it in the paper.
- Thank you.
- Actually, do you have a minute?
I' m sorry, I know this is a terrible time.
Not right now.
The truth is, I went to some trouble to find you.
I' d like to help you.
Help us?
I specialize in fertility.
If we could just talk, it won' t take long, I promise you.
We can go to a restaurant right over there.
I finished the residency in ob- gyn, but my real passion is research.
- What is it you do, Paul?
- I teach biology.
- You do?
- Can you tell us what this is about?
Yeah.
The truth is, there is... there' s no easy way to present this to you, so I' m just gonna come out and say it.
My clinic has perfected a procedure by which a single cell could be used to create a genetically- identical fetus... a fetus which could be carried to term and, in effect, be reborn.
Yes.
Yes.
This would be the identical boy down to the last chromosome on the last hair of his head.
This is how you wanna help us?
I used to be affiliated with a hospital here and I had a chance to review Jessie' s records.
You did what?
I' m aware of the complications surrounding Adam' s delivery, <i>that it' s impossible</ i> <i>for you to conceive again. </ i>
<i>You looked at her records? </ i>
I had to be certain that Jessie' s condition didn' t preclude carrying a child and it doesn' t, so yes, I can help you.
You can have him back, your son Adam, to birth again, to raise.
Paul.
- My son is dead!
- Paul, please.
You come at me with this?
The last thing I want to do is make this time any harder.
But the truth is I can do this, and I want you to know.
What you' re talking about is illegal, not to mention potentially immoral.
Immoral, no.
We' re talking about using life to create life, that' s all.
You' ve successfully cloned a human being?
No, I haven' t but only because I' ve been looking for an ideal candidate.
- in what I' m proposing here...
- What are you proposing here?
- That' s not true...
Still, it does come down to trust.
- You' d be...
- Excuse me, your menus.
You' d be gambling on me as much as I' d be gambling on you.
My clinic is some 300 miles from here.
If you were to do this, it would mean moving there and I' il be honest with you, changing your lives entirely.
Paul' s right, this is extremely against the law.
You' d have to sever all ties with family, with friends, with anyone who ever knew Adam.
Of course I would help with the relocation, and I can get you a job at the local high school.
- You know what, I' ve heard enough.
- Paul, please.
- I know how upsetting this is.
- No, no, no, you don' t know!
You could never know.
<i> - Let' s go! </ i>
<i> - You' re right. </ i>
- Jessie...
- Jessie!
I can be reached at this number.
But Adam' s cells will only be viable another 72 hours.
<i>I can' t believe you' re considering this! </ i>
I can' t believe you' re not considering this.
Any idea how much could go wrong?
Honey, I... listen, I love you, I love you.
But only the tiniest thing has to go wrong and so much has to go right.
But what if it did?
It would be an identical twin.
But he' d have the same face and the same laugh.
- No, we can' t.
- You know we can' t.
We can have...
I don' t want another child!
I want Adam!
I want him back.
You know what I kept thinking while I was waiting for paramedics... and he was in my arms... and I was watching him die?
"This is the last time I' il ever get to hold him."
My little boy.
- Hello.
- <i>Paul. </ i>
I just heard.
I' m so sorry.
<i>Thank you, Sam. </ i>
Um... so... how' s Jessie taking all this?
Actually, she' s... she' s not so well.
<i>Right, of course. </ i>
Look, would you please just pass on my condolences to her?
Yeah, I will.
Hey, Sam, can I... can I ask you something?
<i>Have you ever heard</ i> <i>of a doctor named Richard Wells? </ i>
Sure I' ve heard of him.
Why do you ask?
He was an old teacher of Jessie' s.
He' s the stuff of legend.
He was doing really advanced work on gene mapping.
We' re talking way ahead of his time.
Anyway, last thing I heard, he sold his findings to a huge firm, made a ridiculous amount of money, and then just sort of dropped out of the game entirely.
<i>Every once in a while I come across</ i> <i>an article of his in a journal, </ i> <i>consistently brilliant. </ i>
<i>Like I said, he' s... </ i>
Yeah, I know.
<i> - Paul, I' m so very sorry. </ i>
<i> - Okay, thanks. </ i>
- <i>Or you go like that. </ i>
<i>One... </ i>
- <i>Oh, ooh! </ i>
Can' t you see this?
<i>Three, two, one. </ i>
<i>The game is live! </ i>
<i> - I' m right side up! </ i>
<i>Wait a second, </ i> <i>you' re confusing me. </ i>
Do you think that' s a good idea?
No, I think we should call it Adam.
- <i>Guess who? </ i>
<i> - It' s me, Adam. </ i>
<i> - I don' t think I know an Adam. </ i>
<i> - I' m your son. </ i>
<i> - The family jewels. </ i>
<i>Are we all in? </ i>
- <i>Damn, what a handsome group. </ i>
- <i>Hi, Mom! </ i>
<i> - Adam! </ i>
- This hat.
I' ve never seen you wear this before.
I' ve never seen you wear any hat.
<i>All cells are</ i> <i>in essence clones... </ i> <i>identical copies</ i> <i>of one original cell. </ i>

She did great.
But she did wonderfully.
She has to lie down for at least an hour, so why don' t we go look at the house and I' il show you around?
She' s in good hands.
So, all these people and no one else knows?
The procedure doesn' t differ much from a standard implant.
- Dr. Wells?
- Thanks, George.
There you go.
Riverton' s a great town, I think you' re really gonna like it here.
It' s a bit secluded maybe, but a wonderful community.
Nice people, lots of families... perfect place to raise a child.
So why don' t you follow me?
I' il show you around.
<i>Beautiful country, isn' t it? </ i>
<i>This whole area</ i> <i>has a lot of history. </ i>
<i>And the house itself</ i> <i>is 100 years old at least. </ i>
So I took the liberty of ordering some.
It should be here sometime tomorrow.
What if this didn' t work, Richard?
What if the implant doesn' t take, the procedure' s a bust... what then?
- It' il work, Paul.
Look, no one can say anything with any certainty.
I mean, even a routine pregnancy is fallible.
But if I can speak plainly, what more do you have to lose?
Her.
She' s pinned every hope in the world on this.
And I won' t let her down, or you.
You have my word on that.
Is this for real?
For now.
I can' t believe this place.
Hey.
- What is that?
Oh my God, Paul.
You know what we could put down here?
Darkroom?
- How are you feeling?
- I' m okay.
Jessie!
I' m home to our... big home!
Hey!
Hi.
You said we' d never have a party in here.
- I can' t!
- No, it hurts.
- Yes.
You' re fully dilated, the head' s already crowning, you just need to now push.
- Something' s wrong.
Something' s wrong, I' m telling you.
It' s fine.
- Keep pushing.
Push, push, push.
- Keep pushing, push.
- <i>Come on, push, push, push. </ i>
<i> - Come on, come on. </ i>
Oh, there we go, okay.
All right, all right, we' re out, we' re out.
- That' s it.
It' s okay.
let me just hear you scream.
- Come on, come on.
That' s great, honey.
It' s great.
I just need some breath from him.
He' s all right.
<i>Okay, how long? </ i>
<i>30 seconds, 31, 32... </ i> <i>33, 34, 35... </ i>
- 38, 39...
- What' s wrong?
<i> - 40 seconds, 41... </ i>
- 42, 43...
- Come on, come on.
- 44...
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby, thank God.
This is the same as last time, remember?
It' s him.
You wanted to give us a scare, didn' t you?
Oh, thank you, God.
Thank you.
Here you go, kiddo.
Good night, Adam.
My little boy.
Huh- uh.
It' s always been his name...
<i> # Happy birthday to you # </ i>
There you go, buddy.
Uncle Richard!
Happy birthday, Adam.
Cake! </ i>
It' s good.
It' s good... nice kids, bright too.
I don' t know, sometimes I feel like I' m teaching fish to swim... at a Club Med.
You don' t still miss your old school?
No, it' s more like I miss missing it.
Uncle Richard, want to help me fly it?
<i>Let' s get it up there. </ i>
Keep it away from the trees.
So what was this word you said?
<i>Reeservoier. </ i>
We' ve been learning about natural resources in school.
Oh, you mean a "reservoir."
Well, that' s a lot like a lake, only it' s a man- made lake.
But I thought God made everything.
Well, in a way He did, if you believe He created those people who figured out how to make a reservoir, right?
<i> - See you later, Adam! </ i>
- <i>Thanks, Paul, see you later. </ i>
Bye, Adam!
Why don' t you come on inside, say goodbye to your friends?
<i>Thank you, Adam. </ i>
<i>Bye, Adam! </ i>
- Bye.
- Bye, Paul.
<i>Adam! </ i>
Hey!
Birthday Boy!
How many times I gotta tell you, you can' t leave your toys around?
Somebody' s gonna trip and...
For those of us who don' t wear helmets in the house...
What you doing?
Where did you get this?
It was a birthday present from Joey Smoyer.
<i>Do you like it? </ i>
Yeah.
Why don' t you get some sleep?
Dad, I' ve been thinking...
About what?
I don' t think I like you so much anymore.
- Gotcha!
Ohh, somebody is in some very serious trouble.
- I' m gonna smother you now.
And then...
Iook at him.
I honestly forget sometimes, you know?
And then something like that... that toy dinosaur thing will happen.
It' s okay, it happens to me too.
- What?
- He won' t find out.
What if he did?
About what it would mean to him.
<i>I just love him so much. </ i>
Both of you.
No!
No!
Help!
<i> - Adam! </ i>
- Adam!
It' s okay, I' m right here.
<i>Who are you? </ i>
- Adam!
<i> - No. </ i>
Mom!
Adam?
Adam!
- Go away!
- It' s okay, okay!
- No!
- Stay away!
- Jessie!
It' s okay.
- Get away from me!
Okay, okay!
- Get off!
- All right!
It' s okay.
- Get off me.
- Ow!
- Oh, God!
- What happened?
I don' t know, he just collapsed.
- Call 911!
- I' m calling Richard.
Richard, thank God.
Paul, my staff and I can handle this.
They don' t need to.
It' s the same as always... we' re close friends.
You know our arrangement.
It' s five hours, he' s still unconscious.
His respiration and color are good and he' s responding to low- level stimuli.
Except for some reason, he' s not waking up.
- He seems to have night terrors.
It' s a sleep disorder.
He may sit up, walk, even talk, but all attempts to wake him are futile.
This is something entirely different.
All right... hold on a minute.
I know it' s scary, but we talked about this... the possibility that things could change once Adam crossed the age at which he died.
<i>Well, it' s been eight years. </ i>
<i>As of now, he' s crossed it. </ i>
Because I couldn' t have known.
Look, he is the only one, period.
<i>We are and always have been</ i> <i>at the mercy of that fact. </ i>
Adam' s first eight years.
But now we' re entering uncharted territory.
We have no way of knowing who the Adam of age nine, age 10, age 50, is going to be, what problems he may or may not have.
I promise you, there' s nothing more a hospital would be doing for him.
What' s happening here, Richard?
My feeling is it' s probably nothing.
Let' s just give it a little time, okay?
Yeah.
I' ve always had this feeling that somehow we wouldn' t get away with this.
Not that someone would find out, just... somehow, we' d lose him again.
We' re not gonna lose him.
We' re not gonna lose him.
It' s okay, it' s okay.
Boo!
- Oh, Adam!
- Oh my gosh!
- Hey.
- He' s fine.
- You okay?
I' m feeling hungry!
- Mommy!
- Everything' s okay.
This is fantastic, fantastic.
- You feel good?
- <i>Ahh! </ i>
<i>My God, </ i> <i>you slept enough. </ i>
- I' il see you all tomorrow.
<i>Adam, dinner' s on. </ i>
Jessie, he' s not up here.
<i>Adam! </ i>
Hey, come on.
Adam!
<i>Hey! </ i>
Adam?
Adam?
Adam!
Adam?
There you are.
<i>What are you doing here? </ i>
Didn' t you hear me calling you?
Hey... are you all right?
I' m talking to you.
Adam?
Hey!
Answer me.
Yes, Daddy?
Did you hear me calling you?
Your dinner is ready.
Go in the house.
No, Paul just said it was kind of a strange moment.
No, he seems fine.
Yeah, that' s what I' m hoping... it' s probably nothing.
I don' t think it' s anything to worry about, okay?
All right, take care and I' il see you soon.
All right, well, thanks, Richard.
Take care.
I think we should take him to a specialist.
And his word' s gospel?
How long are we supposed to live like this?
When does all this gratitude end?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
Bye, Mom.
- Anybody know what this is?
It' s a big ugly visual aide.
Let' s do it like this.
If you think of DNA as a fuse box, aach of the genes are either switched on or off, depending on which cell we' re talking about.
So that the genes responsible for say the length of Kevin' s...... nose hair wouldn' t be much use in his pinky toe.
So what, the gene isn' t present?
No, no, it' s present, it' s just inactive.
It' s turned off.
It' s dead.
You know what?
Why don' t you just take a look at chapter 11 for the rest of the period and then, you know, go?
I' m going to put on a little show for you guys and you' re going to pay me your lunch money.
I' il beat the crap out of you for the rest of your life.
How about this?
How about... yes!
What are you going to do about it, huh?
You' re a tiny little boy.
Listen, maybe it' s significant, maybe it isn' t,
But the fact remains that any changes in health or behavior
- If that' s what they are.
Paul, it' s a common sleep disorder.
What do you want me to say, Paul?
That there' s something seriously wrong with him?
- You don' t think I' m just as concerned?
You have every right to worry.
But for eight years, we' ve known what to expect.
From now on, neither do we.
- You know what I meant.
Can I get back to my patients, please?
Ever want to have any children of your own, Richard?
- It seems like such a shame.
- Paul, he' s your son.
Believe me, I know what he means to you.
But maybe you can keep in mind what he does mean to me.
- Oh, hey there!
There you are.
Why so glum, chum?
There' s this new kid, Roy Hazen, he' s always showing off,
- He' s a total ass wipe.
Where did you learn that language?
I don' t know.
I don' t like it.
Get in the car.
- Oh, God!
- Adam.
- Adam!
I' m sorry.
Oh, God, I didn' t see you.
Do you know that?
Do you?
- Daddy, you' re hurting me!
- To keep your bicycle off the street?
What' s the matter with you?
<i> - You okay, honey? </ i>
<i> - Yes. </ i>
You sure?
Yeah, I would, actually.
Let me get a pen.
Dr. Lieber?
In Beauford?
Great.
Sam, I appreciate this.
Talk to you soon.
Bye.
Wrong number.
<i>Adam! </ i>
Adam?
Adam, open the door.
<i>Open the door, son. </ i>
Open the door!
<i>Adam? </ i>
God damn it!
Open the door, son.
What... why is the door locked?
- What?
- The curtain.
He was under there.
No, no, no, no, look.
What are you talking about?
- Look, it' s fine.
- No, no.
Don' t let him hurt me.
Look, look, look, it' s okay.
Shh, calm down.
I think you just had a bad dream.
- No.
- Huh?
- I saw it.
What did you see?
Adam, talk to me.
Please.
I can' t help you if I don' t know what this is.
I know something.
Okay, what?
Something bad is going to happen.
No, it' s not.
I' il never let anything bad ever happen to you.
Not to me.
Listen to me, you' re my son, you understand that?
Huh?
- I' m your son.
That' s right.
We' re gonna be okay.
So, how many eggs did you retrieve?
I only retrieved three.
- Richard, hi.
- Hi.
I' m sorry if this is a bad time.
No, it' s fine.
- Excuse us.
What' s the matter?
I need to speak with you about something...
I have to stop off at home for some papers.
Why don' t I fix us some lunch?
Hey, hey, how would you like that?
<i>I just got an idea. </ i>
How about we have a swinging contest?
- You guys will be the judges.
- Yeah.
Ladies first.
Don' t go too high, you' il start crying.
Don' t break a nail, oh, no!
<i> - Come on, you chicken. </ i>
- Oh, what' s that for?
- Nasty monkey.
No spitting.
Come on, come down from there.
Come down right now.
No... hey!
- Hey...
So what you' re saying, these nightmares might have started at this age anyway?
Or possibly triggered by any number of things... school, stress, tension at home.
Paul is convinced that somehow Adam' s cells have...
Retained memories of his first life?
There' s an often cited experiment... a rat was trained to run a maze, killed, then ground up and fed to a second rat.
<i>The second rat, when presented</ i> <i>with the same maze, </ i> completed it in record time, proving that memory lived on in those ingested cells.
It' s fascinating, really, also a bunch of nonsense... <i>an urban legend. </ i>
So, it' s not possible he' s remembering?
No, no.
Thank God.
Frankly, I' m more concerned about Paul' s working up these strange theories.
Paul is just having a tough time right now.
It' s good.
He' s never felt as comfortable here as you, has he?
No.
You don' t think he' d ever try to leave, do you?
Jessie, that can' t happen.
Out here in the middle of nowhere, it' s easy to forget the consequences of what we' ve done.
But if anyone ever found out, <i>you might</ i> <i>never see Adam again. </ i>
I know.
I can trust you to rein Paul in?
Yes.
Sorry, I just got the message.
They called me at the high school.
Apparently, they couldn' t reach you?
How' s Adam?
- He' s fine, Mrs. Duncan.
I have him waiting in my office right now.
I don' t know exactly how to say this, but... <i>his behavior has distanced</ i> <i>some of the other children. </ i>
And the thing is, he could have seriously injured himself.
Let' s go in and see him, okay?
Is that wine on your breath?
- I was having lunch.
- With who?
<i>Why are you so upset? </ i>
It was just lunch.
I just wanted to talk to him about Adam.
God, Paul.
To get a second opinion.
Are you kidding me?
Am I smiling?
<i>About these night terrors... </ i> you' re confident that' s what this is?
I see it in a number of kids Adam' s age.
Scares the bejesus out of the parents, but the kids outgrow it.
As for Adam' s recent changes in behavior, well, he' s poorly rested...
No, you don' t know him.
This is something else.
- <i>Who? </ i>
<i> - Zachary. </ i>
Mr. Duncan, who is Zachary?
Is he a boy in his class?
I don' t know.
Honey, who is Zachary?
He' s the boy who lives in my dreams.
This boy told you his name was Zachary?
Not really, I kind of just know.
And you' ve never seen his face?
He doesn' t like to show it, but I know because of his jacket.
What kind of jacket?
It' s red with white sleeves.
<i>Where are we going? </ i>
<i>Where are we going? </ i>
- Adam?
- Zachary.
Zachary?
- Where we live.
I don' t want to do this.
This is crazy.
According to who?
Richard?
<i>The way he is handling this, </ i> <i>the way he stays so close to us. </ i>
- I don' t...
Zachary, Zachary, where are you?
- Tell me about Zachary.
- He' s never even known a Zachary.
Say it.
- Say it!
- That' s enough, stop it.
- Tell us what you' re trying to say.
If you don' t understand it, how do you expect to beat it?
- I don' t want to understand it.
- Paul, watch out!
Are you okay?
Honey, you okay?
- Is he all right?
- He' s okay.
I' m sorry.
Okay, kiddo, there you go.
You' re home now, all right?
You just go to sleep, all right?
<i>Dad... </ i> did I die?
Of course not.
Go to sleep.
Oh my God, that' s what this is.
He' s remembering his first life in his dreams.
- Kids say things like that.
Jesus, it' s possible.
- He' s not remembering.
- How can you say that?
Because he can' t.
Honey, wake up.
We' re at school.
<i>Okay now, I want</ i> <i>to see everyone in your family</ i> outside your houses in the pictures, okay?
Take your time.
<i>And don' t forget</ i> <i>to write your name on it. </ i>
<i>Nice and big.
I want to put these up</ i> <i>around the classroom. </ i>
<i>Beautiful. </ i>
<i>You can put pets</ i> <i>in your pictures... </ i> <i>dogs and cats. </ i>
<i>Have some fun. </ i>
- Hi, Pat.
- Hi, Jessie.
I just thought I' d stop by to see how the stuff' s doing.
Come in.
Richard Wells was in yesterday.
He bought this big one and these three small ones on the spot.
- That' s great.
- Hi.
<i> - Richard, hi. </ i>
I just thought I' d see how Adam' s doing.
<i>Not so well, actually. </ i>
He had another night terror last night.
I' m wondering if we can use his ability to vocalize in that state to our advantage.
What would that entail?
Well, for starters, I' d like you to bring him in again.
I' m not sure Paul would be comfortable with that.
- I know we did.
<i> - Please do. </ i>
<i>I need to go, Richard. </ i>
Come on, you guys, let' s go!
Come on, you chickens!
Wussies!
Let' s go!
I' m doing it!
<i>Are you afraid of something? </ i>
<i>Let' s go! </ i>
<i>Come on, let' s go! </ i>
<i>Let' s go! </ i>
<i>Come on, come on! </ i>
<i>Come on, I' m doing it! </ i>
<i>You can! </ i>
You want your ba- ba?
<i>Who' s there? </ i>
Please be okay.
Please don' t touch this.
Jessie?
<i>You down there? </ i>
- Did you hear me?
- Huh?
- Are you hungry?
Hi, Mom.
Yeah.
<i> - Hello? </ i>
No, I' m sorry, Tanya, he isn' t.
Tanya, slow down.
Hold on, I' il ask him right now.
Adam, roy' s mother says he hasn' t come home from school yet.
- No.
Wait, wait, wait.
What were you doing down at the river this afternoon?
Just playing.
With who?
I' m not supposed to say.
Adam, can you answer me?
Go to your room.
Now!
I' m sorry, Tanya, he doesn' t know.
Yeah, good luck.
You said Richard mentioned using his ability to vocalize to find out more.
Call him.
We' il bring Adam in tomorrow.
Adam, what' s the name of the school?
Can you tell me the name of the school?
Pius...
S- s- street.
Could it be Saint Pius?
Are you sure this can' t hurt him?
We' re just poking around to see what we dig up.
Right Paul?
Yeah.
Adam... is Zachary in there?
They all are.
They all are.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Z- zachary.
Clark.
<i>Z - zach... </ i>
Zachary Clark?
<i>Who is Zachary Clark? </ i>
They think I' m him.
Are you him?
Who are you?
They think I' m him.
- They think I' m him!
They think I' m him!
- No!
- Adam?
- Richard, release him.
- It' s hurting him.
- Hot!
Hot!
Adam?
Goddamn it, do something!
Hot! </ i>
<i> - Adam, wake up.
Adam? </ i>
Honey?
- Daddy?
- Yeah.
<i>You' re okay.
You' re okay. </ i>
Hey, why' d you call him Zachary?
Answer me, Richard.
Because he wasn' t responding to his own name.
That' s bullshit!
- You set me up!
You needed my okay to push him, but you wanted him pushed.
- Paul, you' ve gone completely...
- Stop telling me what' s wrong with me, and tell me what' s wrong with my goddamn son!
I wish I could help you.
Adam' s changing.
Sometimes it' s like there' s two of him.
He' s destructive.
He' s tried to harm himself.
The other kids at school are scared of him, Richard.
There' s something you' re not telling us.
There have been times I' ve seen you talking to him and he' s in that same blank state, but he listens to you, doesn' t he, huh?
Adam' s all I care about in the whole world.
You understand I' il go public?
I swear to God, I' il tell the whole goddamn world what you' ve done.
What <i>we' ve done, Paul. </ i>
What <i>we' ve done. </ i>
Maybe he is remembering.
Or maybe it' s something else.
Why that name, Zachary Clark, or the school?
Look, I have tomorrow off,
It' s a few hours drive into the city.
- I' m gonna look into it.
- If Richard found out...
- He won' t.
<i> - Paul, no. </ i>
Hold on.
<i>No!
No! </ i>
Let me go!
Let me go!
<i>Nooo!
No! </ i>
Let me go!
My baby!
<i>My baby! </ i>
My baby!
No!
My baby! </ i>
Jessie, can I see you?
Now?
I told you.
It doesn' t mean...
You' re the one who said he never got along with that boy.
The twins said they saw Roy playing down by the water, that he' d been showing off.
I' m not sure of anything right now.
No matter what he does, he' s still our son.
Huh?
What are you saying?
You wish we' d never done this?
Good night, baby.
Mommy loves you.
You scared me.
It' s okay, Mommy.
Shit.
Sorry, there' s nothing here.
Are you sure this is the only Saint Pius?
Like I said, they' ve been closed for some time now.
What about past student records, like a search by name?
I' m looking for a Zachary Clark.
Well, by name could take a while.
A few weeks?
- Hi.
My name' s Paul Duncan.
I know this sounds crazy, but I' m here about Zachary Clark.
<i>Does that name mean</ i> <i>anything to you? </ i>
<i> - He' s a young child, a boy. </ i>
<i> - No, I' m sorry. </ i>
Did they have any children?
Melinda.
I' m sorry.
No, there were no previous owners.
My husband and I bought this place about six years ago <i>when it was just</ i> <i>a burnt- down shell. </ i>
And he' s an architect, so we restored it.
- So, it was just vacant?
<i> - Well, for a few years, yeah. </ i>
But I don' t know anything about its previous owners.
- I' m sorry, I just...
Sorry, the nanny... we interviewed quite a few nannies, mostly by phone, but I remember speaking to one who I could have sworn said she used to work for the family who used to live at this address.
I think that I saved her contact information, if...
Great, thank you.
Cora Williams?
You don' t know me, but I need to talk to you.
It' s about Zachary Clark.
Come in.
You have no messages.
Damn it!
<i>I had hoped I' d never</ i> <i>hear that name again. </ i>
What did he do?
There had been incidents at school.
He never had any friends, used to come home with all sorts of scrapes.
A teacher finally found him, terrified and shaken.
But that was before he started acting up.
<i>Pretty soon, </ i> <i>those kids got wise</ i> <i>and just left him alone. </ i>
Then there was the fire.
The fire at Saint Pius?
Cora:
<i>They never found out how</ i> <i>the fire got started, but I knew. </ i>
<i>And when Zachary came home, </ i> <i>I asked him about it. </ i>
<i>He just gave me this smile. </ i>
Adam?
I didn' t see anything but evil behind them.
<i>I kept my distance. </ i>
<i>I was scared of what else</ i> <i>he might be capable of... </ i> <i>all these terrible thoughts</ i> <i>running through my mind. </ i>
It was just the two of us at home that day.
He was taking his bath <i>when it suddenly became</ i> <i>clear to me what I had to do. </ i>
<i>He never even</ i> <i>heard me come in. </ i>
<i>I tried</ i> <i>to go through with it. </ i>
<i>I swear I tried, but... </ i>
I couldn' t.
I just couldn' t.
Zachary didn' t say a word about what I' d done.
Are you here?
<i>I was at home the next day, </ i> <i>when I was struck</ i> <i>by the most awful premonition. </ i>
<i>I hurried right over. </ i>
<i>Two blocks away, I could</ i> <i>already hear the sirens. </ i>
<i>Then I saw all that smoke. </ i>
I rushed into the house, blinded by all those flames, praying I wasn' t too late.
But you were.
<i>It turned out his mother</ i> <i>was already dead by then. </ i>
<i>I remember it was</ i> <i>freezing cold that day. </ i>
<i>It was always cold</ i> <i>in that big house. </ i>
Adam?
<i>So she went down</ i> <i>the stairs to the basement, </ i> <i>to check on</ i> <i>the water heater. </ i>
Are you down there?
<i>And that' s where he was... </ i> <i>just waiting for her. </ i>
So you' re saying Zachary killed his mother.
He used a hammer he took down from the wall.
And when he was done, he set a fire.
<i>Then he went upstairs</ i> <i>and finished playing. </ i>
That' s where they found his body.
Where was his father?
Oh, he was at the hospital like always.
The hospital, he was a doctor?
Only, he seemed more like a scientist to me.
- <i>Come on, come on. </ i>
Come on.
Goddamn it!
<i>Are you home?
Jessie? </ i>
<i>Pick it up</ i> <i>if you' re there, please. </ i>
<i>Listen, I gotta talk to you</ i> <i>right away, it' s important. </ i>
<i>Call me as soon</ i> <i>as you get this. </ i>
<i> - I love you. </ i>
<i>Adam? </ i>
Honey, you shouldn' t have opened that.
You shouldn' t have touched that box.
Adam?
Is this me?
Honey, let me explain.
Adam.
Zachary.
- What?!
I need to speak with Richard Wells.
<i>I' m sorry, but Dr. Wells</ i> <i>is at the Hazen funeral today. </ i>
Honey, don' t be scared.
It' s okay.
Just be careful, okay?
What was that?
Honey...
<i>Mommy? </ i>
Adam, where are you?
Adam?
Adam can' t come out to play right now, Mrs. Duncan.
Wait.
Wait!
Let me explain.
Adam.
You couldn' t use him, could you?
Zachary.
Maybe it never even occurred to you to try.
No, it occurred to me.
But the fire destroyed him, right?
His genetics I could salvage, but it was no more than pieces of a map.
I was this close to perfecting the procedure, you can' t possibly fathom that kind of torture.
To have this knowledge, this power, and know there' s nothing more you can do about it.
Once you had Adam' s cell, you could preserve his physical characteristics and manipulate certain genes... intangibles, like cognition, personality, his memory.
- I' m right, aren' t I?
There was no way to predict the results.
Lived on?
Do you have any idea what you' ve done to my son?!
I' d think you of all people would understand, seeing as we were both after the same thing.
I just wanted him back.
You experimented with a human life!
So did your wife.
No, I would say there' s a huge difference...
We trusted you, goddamn it!
We had no way of knowing.
Beyond what?
Tell me something.
If I' m not supposed to do this, Paul, then how is it that I can?
Because you' re a scientist.
Only this isn' t about science or evolution... it' s about moral trespass, about your ignoring what' s right and wrong.
Have you trespassed?
I don' t know.
Yeah, maybe this is my punishment for wanting something that I never should have had.
And if that' s the case, then so be it.
But believe me when I tell you, I' m gonna do everything in my power to save my child and see that you pay for what you' ve done.
- No, this is over, you understand?
We' re gonna go to the police, and then we' re gonna find someplace, anyplace that can help him.
That was an experiment.
We can always terminate and try again.
Terminate?
That' s my son you' re talking about.
Our son!
He' s yours because I gave him to you.
You stay away from him!
You hear me?
You stay away!
You were lucky to have him as long as you did.
You had nothing when I found you.
Anything in your life that you value, I provided.
You remember that, you... you ungrateful piece of shit!
Why, why, why didn' t he listen?
Adam!
Adam?
Are you in here?
Adam, where are you?
Let go.
Let go of the axe.
Adam.
Adam.
Yes, Daddy?
Who are you?
I' m your son.
Goes upstairs.
All right, if you guys can paint that out by Thursday, that' d be great.
- Great.
- How are you doing?
- All right.
These are going downstairs.
Hey, how do you like your new room?
It' s not finished yet.
Hey, kiddo, look...
But those doctors you' ve been working with, they all say this change could be really good for you, right?
Sweetie, you' ve been doing so great.
And I bet... in a new town, with new friends, you' re gonna do even better.
I know.
Duncan? </ i>
Coming.
I got three boxes downstairs
And they' re all labeled...
How about you give me a hand unpacking 'em?
Yeah?
<i>Where would you like these? </ i>
Oh, careful with that, it' s going downstairs.
Hey, kiddo, I thought you were...
Adam?
Ahh!
God!
I thought you were coming down.
Are you all right?
You' d tell me if there was anything...
I' m fine.
All right.
Trust me.
It' s a place we can start all over.

Hi.
I' ve got an appointment with Mr. UIlman.
My name is Jack Torrance.
His office is the first door on the Ieft.
Thank you.
Mr. UIlman?
I' m Jack Torrance.
Come on in, Jack.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
This is my secretary, Susie.
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?
No problem at aIl.
I made the trip in 3 1 / 2 hours.
That' s very good time.
Sit down a minute, Jack.
Just make yourself at home.
Like some coffee?
If you' re having some, I wouldn' t mind.
Thanks.
- Susie.
- Sure.
And ask BiII Watson to join us.
Yes, I wiIl.
Mom?
Yeah?
Do you reaIly want to go and Iive in that hoteI for the winter?
Sure I do.
It' II be Iots of fun.
Yeah.
I guess so.
Anyway, there' s hardly anybody to play with around here.
I know.
It always takes a Iittle time to make new friends.
Yeah, I guess so.
What about Tony?
He' s Iooking forward to the hotel, I bet.
No, I ain 't, Mrs. Torrance.
Don' t be siIly.
I don 't want to go there.
How come you don' t want to go?
I just don 't.
Did they give you any idea in Denver...... about what the job entails?
Only in a very generaI way.
The winters can be fantasticaIly cruel.
The basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage...... and depreciation which can occur.
This consists mainly of running the boiler...... heating different parts of the hoteI on a daily rotating basis...... repairing damage as it occurs...... and doing repairs so the elements can' t get a foothold.
That sounds fine to me.
PhysicaIly, it' s not a very demanding job.
The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter...... is a tremendous sense of isolation.
That just happens to be exactly what I' m Iooking for.
I' m outlining a new writing project.
Five months of peace is just what I want.
That' s very good, Jack.
Because, for some people...... solitude...... and isolation...... can, of itself, become a problem.
Not for me.
Do you think they' II take to it?
They' II love it.
Great.
Before I turn you over to BiIl...... there' s one other thing I think we should talk about.
Not to sound melodramatic...... but it' s been known to give a few people...... second thoughts about the job.
I' m intrigued.
I don' t suppose they said anything in Denver...... about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970.
I don' t believe they did.
My predecessor in this job...... hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker.
He came up with his wife and 2 Iittle girls of about 8 and 10.
He had a good employment record, good references.
And from what I' ve been told, he seemed...... Iike a completely normaI individual.
But at some point during the winter...... he must have suffered some kind of a complete mentaI breakdown.
He ran amuck...
... and kiIled his family with an ax.
Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing, and then...... he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.
The police thought...... that it was what the old- timers used to caII cabin fever.
A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur...... when people are shut in together over Iong periods of time.
That is...... quite a story.
Yeah, it is.
It' s stiII hard for me to believe it actuaIly happened here.
But it did.
I think you can appreciate why I wanted to teII you about it.
I certainly can.
I also understand why your people in Denver...... Ieft it for you to teII me.
Obviously, some people can be put off...... from staying in a place where something Iike that happened.
You can rest assured that' s not going to happen with me.
And as far as my wife is concerned...... I' m sure she' II be absolutely fascinated when I teII her.
She' s a confirmed ghost story...... and horror film addict.
Tony, do you think Dad' II get the job?
He already did.
He' s going to phone Wendy up in a few minutes to tell her.
- Hi, hon.
How' s it going?
Great.
I' m at the hoteI and I stiII have a Iot to do.
I don' t think I can get home before 9 or 10.
Sounds Iike you got the job.
It' s a beautifuI place.
You and Danny are going to love it.
Tony, why don' t you want to go to the hotel?
I don 't know.
You do too know.
Now come on, teII me.
I don 't want to.
Please.
No.
Now, Tony, teII me.
We must reaIly be high up.
The air feels so different.
Dad?
I' m hungry.
You should' ve eaten your breakfast.
We' II get you something as soon as we get to the hotel.
Okay, Mom.
Wasn' t it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
I think that was farther west, in the Sierras.
What was the Donner party?
They were a party of settlers in covered wagon times.
They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.
They had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive.
You mean they ate each other up?
They had to, in order to survive.
Jack.
Don' t worry, Mom.
I saw it on TV.
See, it' s okay.
He saw it on the television.
- What time does the plane Ieave?
- 8: 30.
That gives us plenty of time to go over everything.
- Goodbye, Mr. UIlman.
- Bye.
I hope you haven' t been waiting too Iong.
No problem.
We had time to grab a bite to eat.
Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.
Is your family having a Iook around?
No, my son' s discovered the games room.
- Has your Iuggage been brought in?
- Right there.
In view of aII we have to cover today...... I suggest we have a quick Iook at your apartment and get started.
Have the Torrances' things brought to their apartment.
I' d better coIlect my family first.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
It' s beautiful.
My God!
This place is fantastic, isn' t it, hon?
It sure is.
This is the staff wing of the hotel.
None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
- Goodbye, Mr. UIlman.
- Goodbye, girls.
And here are your quarters.
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.
And a smaII bedroom for your son.
Perfect for a child.
When was the Overlook built?
Construction started in 1907.
It was finished in 1909.
The site' s supposedly on an Indian buriaI ground.
They had to repeI a few Indian attacks as they were building it.
That' s our Snowcat.
Can you both drive a car?
That' s fine.
BasicaIly the Snowcat operates very much Iike a car.
It won' t take you Iong to get the hang of it.
This is the kitchen, huh?
This is it.
How do you Iike it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?
It' s the biggest place I ever seen.
This whole place is such an enormous maze.
I' II have to Ieave a traiI of breadcrumbs every time I come in.
Don' t Iet it get you down.
It' s big, but it ain' t nothing but a kitchen.
A Iot of this stuff you' II never have to touch.
I wouldn' t know what to do with it if I did.
One thing for sure, you don' t have to worry about food.
You could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice.
Right here is our walk- in freezer.
This is where we keep aII of our meat.
You got 15 rib roasts...... 30 ten- pound bags of hamburger.
We got 12 turkeys, about 40 chickens...... 50 sirloin steaks, two dozen pork roast...... and 20 Iegs of Iamb.
You Iike Iamb, Doc?
You don' t?
What' s your favorite food?
French fries and ketchup.
I think we can manage that too, Doc.
Come along.
Watch your step.
How' d you know we caII him Doc?
- Beg your pardon?
- You caIled Danny "Doc" twice.
I did?
We caII him Doc sometimes, Iike in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.
But how did you know?
I guess I heard you caII him that.
But I don' t remember...... caIling him that since we' ve been with you.
Anyway, he Iooks Iike a Doc, doesn' t he?
What' s up, Doc?
Now, this is the storeroom.
In here is where we keep aII the dried goods and the canned goods.
We got canned fruits and vegetables...... canned fish and meats, hot and cold cereals.
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes, Sugar Puffs...... Rice Krispies, oatmeal, Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.
You got a dozen jugs of black molasses.
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...
How' d you like some ice cream, Doc?
... Sociables, finger roIls...... and 7 kinds of what have you.
We' ve got dried peaches, dried apricots...... dried raisins and dried prunes.
You know, you got to keep regular if you want to be happy.
- How' re you getting on?
- Fine.
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We' re on our way to the basement.
I promise we won' t keep her very Iong.
No problem.
I was just getting to the ice cream.
You Iike ice cream, Doc?
I thought so.
You mind if I give Danny some ice cream?
- Not at aIl.
- We don' t mind.
- Sound good to you, Doc?
Okay, you behave yourself.
What kind of ice cream do you Iike?
Chocolate.
Chocolate it shaII be.
Come on, son.
It' s amazing, aII this activity today.
The guests and some staff Ieft yesterday, but the...... Iast day' s always hectic.
Everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By 5: 00 tonight, you' II never know anybody was ever here.
Just Iike a ghost ship, huh?
Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?
You know what I' m talking about, don' t you?
I can remember when I was a Iittle boy...... my grandmother and I could hold conversations...... entirely without ever opening our mouths.
She caIled it "shining."
And for a Iong time I thought it was just the two of us...... that had "the shine" to us.
Like you probably thought you was the only one.
But there are other folks...... though mostly they don' t know it, or don' t believe it.
How Iong have you been able to do it?
Why don' t you want to talk about it?
I' m not supposed to.
Who says you ain' t supposed to?
Tony.
Who' s Tony?
Tony' s the Iittle boy that Iives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that teIls you things?
How does he teII you things?
It' s Iike I go to sleep and he shows me things.
But when I wake up, I can' t remember everything.
Does your mom and dad know about Tony?
Do they know he teIls you things?
Tony told me never to teII them.
Has Tony ever told you anything about this place?
About the Overlook Hotel?
I don' t know.
Now think reaI hard, Doc.
Think.
Is there something bad here?
You know, Doc, when something happens...... it can Ieave a trace of itself behind.
Say, Iike...... if someone burns toast.
Maybe things that happen Ieave other kind of traces behind.
Not things that anyone can notice.
But things that people who shine can see.
... sometimes they can see things that happened a Iong time ago.
I think a Iot of things happened right here...... in this particular hoteI over the years.
And not aII of them was good.
What about Room 237?
Room 237?
You' re scared of Room 237, ain' t you?
No, I ain' t.
Mr. HaIlorann, what is in Room 237?
Nothing.
There ain' t nothing in Room 237.
But you ain' t got no business going in there anyway.
So stay out.
You understand?
Stay out!
Good morning, hon.
Your breakfast is ready.
What time is it?
It' s about 11: 30.
Jesus!
I guess we' ve been staying up too Iate.
I know it.
I made them just the way you Iike them, sunny- side up.
Nice.
How about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast?
I suppose I ought to try to do some writing first.
Any ideas yet?
Lots of ideas.
No good ones.
Something wiII come.
It' s just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day.
That' s aII it is.
- AII right.
- And you' re going to Iose.
And I' m going to get you.
You' d better run fast!
Look out!
I' m coming in close.
Loser has to keep America clean.
Keep America clean.
Danny, you win.
Let' s take the rest of this walking.
Give me your hand.
Isn' t it beautiful?
Dead end.
We made it.
Isn' t it beautiful?
It' s so pretty.
Did you?
Hi, hon.
How' s it going?
Fine.
Get a Iot written today?
The weather forecast said it' s going to snow tonight.
What do you want me to do about it?
Come on, hon.
Don' t be so grouchy.
I' m not...... being grouchy.
I just want to finish my work.
Okay.
I understand.
I' II come back Iater with a couple of sandwiches.
Maybe you' II Iet me read something then.
Wendy...... Iet me explain something to you.
When you come in and interrupt, you' re breaking my concentration.
You' re distracting me...... and it wiII then take time to get back to where I was.
Understand?
Fine.
We' re making a new rule:
... or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here...... when I' m in here, that means I am working.
That means don' t come in.
Do you think you can handle that?
Fine.
Why don' t you start right now and get the fuck out of here?
Missed!
Don' t have!
No fair anymore.
I knew it.
This is KDK 12 caIling KDK 1.
KDK 12 to KDK 1.
We' re receiving you.
Over.
This is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel.
How are you folks getting on up there?
Over.
We' re just fine.
But our telephones aren' t doing too weIl.
Over.
Yes, quite a few of them are down due to the storm.
Over.
Any chance of them being repaired soon?
Wouldn' t Iike to say.
Most winters they stay that way untiI spring.
This storm is reaIly something, isn' t it?
Over.
It' s one of the worst we' ve had for years.
Anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Torrance?
I suppose not.
Over.
If you folks have any problems up there, just give us a caIl.
And, Mrs. Torrance?
It might be a good idea if you leave your radio on all the time.
We' II do that.
It was reaI nice talking to you.
Bye.
Over and out.
HeIlo, Danny.
Come and play with us.
Come and play with us, Danny.
... and ever...... and ever.
Tony...... I' m scared.
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.
"It' s just like pictures in a book, Danny.
It isn 't real. "
Can I go to my room and get my fire engine?
Come here for a minute first.
How' s it going, Doc?
Having a good time?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
I want you to have a good time.
I am, Dad.
Do you feeI bad?
I' m just a Iittle bit tired.
Then why don' t you go to sleep?
I can' t.
I got too much to do.
Do you Iike this hotel?
I do.
I love it.
Don' t you?
I guess so.
Good.
I want you to Iike it here.
I wish we could stay here forever...... and ever...... and ever.
What?
You would never hurt Mommy or me, would you?
What do you mean?
Did your mother ever say that to you?
That I would hurt you?
No, Dad.
You sure?
Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny.
I love you more than anything else...... in the whole world.
I would never do anything to hurt you...... never.
You know that, don' t you?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
Mom, are you in there?
What happened?
Honey...... what' s wrong?
I had the most...... terrible nightmare I ever had.
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It' s okay now.
ReaIly.
I dreamed that I...... that I kiIled you and Danny.
But I didn' t just kiII you.
I cut you up into Iittle pieces.
My God.
I must be Iosing my mind.
Everything' s going to be aII right.
Let' s get up off the floor.
Now sit up.
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
Danny!
Everything' s okay!
Just go play in your room for a while.
Your dad' s just got a headache.
Go play in your room.
Honey, Iet me just get him out of here.
I' II be right back.
Why don' t you mind me?
Oh, my God.
What happened to your neck?
What happened to your neck?
You did this to him...... didn' t you?!
You son of a bitch!
You did this to him!
Didn' t you?!
How could you?!
How could you?!
I' d give anything for a drink.
I' d give my goddamn soul...... for just a glass of beer.
Hi, Lloyd.
A Iittle slow tonight, isn' t it?
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.
What wiII it be?
I' m awfuIly glad you asked me that, Lloyd...... because I just happen to have two twenties...... and two tens right here in my waIlet.
I was afraid they' d be there untiI next April.
So here' s what:
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...... a Iittle glass and some ice.
You can do that, can' t you?
You' re not too busy, are you?
No, sir.
I' m not busy at aIl.
Good man.
You set them up...... and I' II knock them back, one by one.
White man' s burden, Lloyd, my man.
White man' s burden.
Say, Lloyd...... it seems I' m temporarily Iight.
How' s my credit in this joint, anyway?
Your credit' s fine, Mr. Torrance.
That' s sweIl.
I Iike you, Lloyd.
I always Iiked you.
You were always the best of them.
Best goddamn bartender...... from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.
Thank you for saying so.
I never Iaid a hand on him, goddamn it.
I didn' t.
I wouldn' t touch one hair on his goddamn Iittle head.
I love the Iittle son of a bitch.
I' d do anything for him.
Any fucking thing for him.
But that bitch!
As Iong as I Iive...... she' II never Iet me forget what happened.
I did hurt him once, okay?
It was an accident.
Completely unintentional.
Whoa! '
'Our summer romances are in full bloom, and everybody, but everybody' s in love!'
'So, cousins, here' s a great song from the Four Seasons.'
That was the summer of 1963, when everybody called me "Baby" and it didn' t occur to me to mind.
That was before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles came, when I couldn' t wait to join the Peace Corps and I thought I' d never find a guy as great as my dad.
That was the summer we went to Kellerman' s.
Oh, my God.
Look at that!
You said I was taking too much.
Well, sweetheart, you brought ten pairs.
But the coral shoes matched that dress.
A tragedy is three men trapped in a mine or police dogs used in Birmingham.
Monks burning themselves in protest.
Butt out, Baby.
Okay, we got horseshoes on the south lawn in 15 minutes!
We' ve got the still life art class.
And for you older folks, we got sacks!
Doc!
Max!
Well, doc, after all these years I finally got you up on my mountain.
So, how' s the blood pressure, Max?
I want you girls to know if it were not for this man,
I' d be standing here dead.
- Billy, get the bags.
- Right away, doc, right away.
I kept the best cabin for you and your beautiful girls.
Hey, thanks a lot.
You want a job here?
There' s a merengue class in the gazebo in the next few minutes.
Used to be a Rockette.
Take it easy.
Three weeks here, it' il feel like a year.
Stomp those grapes and stomp some more!
Listen to the music!
Sorry.
One, two, three, four!
Start the trance!
Follow me into a round robin!
Ladies, the inner circle!
Come on, ladies!
God wouldn' t have given you maracas if he didn' t want you to shake them!
Okay now, ladies, when I say "stop", you' re gonna find the man of your dreams.
Stop!
Now remember, he' s the boss on the dance floor, if nowhere else.
Mom, Dad, I' m going up to the main house to look around.
There are two kinds of help here.
You waiters are all college guys and I went to Harvard and Yale to hire you.
Why?
This is a family place.
That means you keep your fingers out of the water, your hair out of the soup and show the goddamn daughters a good time.
All the daughters.
Even the dogs.
Schlepp 'em out to the terrace, show' em the stars.
- Got that, guys?
Hold it.
Well, if it isn' t the entertainment staff.
Listen, wise ass, you got your own rules.
Dance with the daughters.
Teach 'em the mambo, the cha- cha, anything they pay for.
That' s where it ends.
No funny business, no conversations and keep yer hands off!
Some ass in the woods, but no conversation.
Watch it, Rodriguez.
What you can and can' t lay your hands on?
Just put your pickle on everybody' s plate, college boy, and leave the hard stuff to me.
Sit down, sit down and I' il get you some wine.
Thank you, Max.
This is Dr. and Mrs. Houseman, Baby, Lisa.
Tthis is your waiter, Robbie Gould.
Yale medical school.
Robbie, these people are my special guests.
Give them anything they want.
- Thanks, Max.
Oh, look at all this leftover food.
Are there still starving children in Europe?
- Try Southeast Asia, Ma.
- Oh, right.
Robbie, Baby wants to send her leftover pot roast to Southeast Asia, so anything we don' t finish, you wrap up.
Max, our Baby' s gonna change the world.
- And what are you gonna do, Missy?
- Oh Lisa' s gonna decorate it.
She already does.
Doc, I want you to meet someone.
Goes to the Cornell School of Hotel Management.
Oh, Baby' s starting Mount Holyoke in the fall.
Oh, great.
Are you going to major in English?
Economics of underdeveloped countries.
I' m going into the Peace Corps.
I' m going to Mississippi with a couple of busboys, freedom ride.
This is our own Tito Suarez.
Yeah!
Come on!
Who' s that?
Oh, them.
They' re the dance people.
They' re here to keep the guests happy.
That' s not gonna sell lessons.
Having fun?
- Yeah.
I' m in charge of the games tonight.
Say, would you like to help me get things started?
Sure she would.
This' il only hurt for a minute.
You' ve got Blue Cross, right?
Was that good for you?
And for being such a good sport, here you go!
Dresses like her, acts like her.
My father doesn' t like her!
Go figure.
- How' d you get here?
- I was taking a walk.
- Go back.
- No.
What' s up there?
House rules.
Why don' t you go back to the playhouse?
I saw you dancing with little boss man.
Can you keep a secret?
Your parents would kill you.
Max would kill me.
Where?
I don' t know.
Kids are doing it in their basements back home.
Come on, Baby.
Can you imagine dancing like this on the main floor, home of the family fox- trot?
Max would close the place down first.
That' s my cousin, Johnny Castle.
He got me the job here.
- Yeah.
You' d think they werea couple, wouldn' t you?
- Aren' t they?
- Nah, not since we were kids.
Yo, Cous, what' s she doing here?
She came with me.
She' s with me.
I carried a watermelon.
I carried a watermelon?
Watch my eyes.
Good.
That' s better.
Good.
Now roll this way.
Now watch.
Look.
'Ladies, join our hair- raising wig show.'
'or Elizabeth Taylor- Cleopatra wig.'
- I' il knock with three.
- Look at that, look at that cute fella.
They' re golden hands.
My God, it' s Cleopatra!
I feel like such an asp.
You look ten years younger.
'on the psychology of insult comedians.'
So I say, "Ask not what your waiter can do for you, but what you can do for your waiter."
You know, if tips keep up, I' il have enough for my Alfa Romeo.
That' s my favorite car.
Ladies, you look very lovely.
Tell Mom and Daddy I went to lie down.
Where are you going?
To the golf course.
There' s a pretty view from the first tee.
Thanks.
So, you were really a Rockette?
I think you' re a wonderful dancer.
Yeah, well, my mother kicked me out when I was 16.
I' ve been dancing ever since.
It' s the only thing I ever wanted to do anyway.
I envy you.
- Aren' t you dancing, doc?
- We' re waiting for a waltz.
Aren' t my dance lessons starting to pay off?
You look great, Vivian!
Terrific!
That' s Vivian Pressman, one of the bungalow bunnies.
That' s what we call the women who stay here all week long.
The husbands only come up on weekends.
He' il join our game.
- Moe coming up on Friday?
- Friday.
I know.
It' s a hardship.
Where' s Penny?
Everybody' s been asking for her.
What do you mean, where' s Penny?
She' s taking a break.
She needs a break.
As long as it' s not an all- night break.
Let' s take a walk.
I love to watch your hair blowing in the breeze.
Maybe my parents are looking for me.
Baby, don' t worry.
If they think you' re with me, they' il be the happiest parents at Kellerman' s.
I have to say it.
I' m known as the catch of the county.
- I' m sure you are.
I took a girl away from Jamie, the lifeguard.
And he said to her, right in front of me, "What does he have that I don' t have?"
And she said, "Two hotels."
Robbie.
I don' t hear an apology.
Go back to Mommy and Daddy and keep listening, Lisa.
Maybe you' il hear one in your dreams.
I' m sorry you had to see that.
Sometimes in this world...... you see things you don' t wanna see.
You hungry?
Come on.
You can have anything you want.
A brownie, some milk, leftover rice pudding...... beets, leftover cabbage roll...
... fruit salad, sweet gherkins?
Oh, Neil, look, I' m sorry.
Yeah.
Why' s she here?
- I brought her in case Neil comes back.
- Penny just doesn' t think.
She wouldn' t do anything stupid, would she?
So, what' s wrong?
What' s the matter with her?
- Billy!
- What' s he gonna do about it?
- "What' s he gonna do about it?"
Oh, it' s mine, right?
- Right away you think it' s mine.
- But I thought the...
Johnny' s here.
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
I' m never gonna let anything happen to you.
We got to go.
Just hold on.
Good girl.
You' re in trouble, you talk to me.
I' il take care of it.
You should' ve come to me in the first place.
I' m not taking what' s left of your salary.
- Penny, that' s my business.
- Besides, it wouldn' t be enough.
Oh, God, it' s hopeless!
Don' t say that.
There' s gotta be a way to work it out.
Baby?
Is that your name?
Well, you know what, Baby?
You don' t know shit about my problems.
I told her.
Jesus, Billy!
Now she' s gonna run and tell her little management boyfriend and then we' il all get fired.
Why not skywrite it?
Robbie?!
- Look...
- No, Baby, Baby.
One of the counselors knows a doctor, a real MD, just traveling through New Paltz for one day next week.
We can get her an appointment, but it' d cost $250.
But if it' s Robbie, there' s no problem.
I know he has the money.
- I' m sure if you tell him...
Go back to your playpen...
And just where do you get off telling me what' s right?
- But you can' t just leave her.
- I didn' t blow a summer hauling toasted bagels just to bail out some little chick who probably ball every guy in the place.
A little precision please, Baby.
Some people count and some people don' t.
Read it.
I have notes in the margin.
You make me sick.
Stay away from me, stay away from my sister or I' il have you fired.
What am I doing wrong?
You' re lining it up a little wrong, Marge.
You know, if your mother ever leaves me, it' il be for Arnold Palmer.
- Daddy, someone' s in trouble.
- Besides your mother?
Now, you' re overcorrecting, Marge.
You always told me if someone was in trouble, I should try to help.
Could you lend me $250?
Are you all right, Baby?
No, no, it' s not me.
Could you loan it to me?
That' s a lot of money, Baby.
What' s it for?
Baby, stand up straight.
I can' t tell you.
It' s hard for me to say that to you, but I can' t.
You always said you could tell me anything.
I can' t tell you this.
It' s not illegal, is it?
No, Daddy.
That was a stupid thing to ask.
Forgive me.
I' il have it for you before dinner.
- Is everything all right?
Thanks.
Here' s money.
- You mean Robbie?
- No, you were right about him.
- Then where' d you get it?
- You said you needed it.
- Is this kid for real?
- Yeah, takes a real saint to ask Daddy.
Thanks, Baby, but I can' t use it.
You should take the money.
I can only get her an appointment for Thursday.
They do their act at the Sheldrake on Thursday night.
If they cancel, they lose this season' s salary and next year' s gig.
It' s another hotel where they do their mambo act.
Can' t someone else fill in?
Somebody else can' t fill in.
And Janet has to fill in for Penny.
Everybody works here.
What, do you wanna do it?
You wanna take time out from "Simon Says"?
It' s not a bad idea.
It was a joke, Billy.
She can move.
No, it' s the dumbest idea I ever heard of.
- See?
You can lead anybody.
She can' t even do the merengue.
She cannot do it.
- Oh, sorry.
Sorry.
You don' t step on the one.
You gotta start on the two.
You understand?
I told you I never did any of these dances before.
Now, it' s one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
Got it?
Relax, relax.
Breathe.
Frame.
Nope.
Again.
Lifting up.
Two, three, four, two, three, four.
Again.
And concentrate.
And...
Don' t put your heel down.
I...
Just listen to me.
Feel the music.
It' s a feeling, a heartbeat.
Don' t try so hard.
Close your eyes.
Breathe.
Head up.
Lock your frame.
Lock it.
Look, spaghetti arm.
This is your dance space.
You gotta hold the frame.
Again.
Frame.
Easy.
And lift - you' il learn that later.
And come on.
Twist.
- Sorry.
- You trying to kill me?
You gotta concentrate!
Is that your idea of fun?
Oh yes, as a matter of fact it is.
We' re supposed to do the show in two days, you won' t show me lifts, I' m not sure of turns.
I' m doing all this to save your ass, but what I' d really wanna do is drop you on it!
Let' s get outa here.
Shit!
I locked the keys in the car!
You' re getting wet, right?
- You' re wild.
- What?
You' re wild!
Now, the most important thing to remember in lifts is balance.
I got it now.
So where' d you learn to be a dancer?
And he said that Arthur Murray was giving a test for instructors.
So, if you passed...
... they teach you all this different kinds of dances, show you how to break 'em down, how to teach' em, you know.
What?
No.
Right here.
And...
Now, bend your knees and go up.
Go, go.
Good.
Now, you' il hurt me if you don' t trust me, all right?
Go.
Good.
Now, I' m gonna go up, all right?
You know, the best place to practice lifts is in the water.
And... go.
Good.
Now hold the position.
Hold it.
Good.
Don' t break!
Let' s do it again.
All right.
One, two, three.
Oh, sorry.
Good.
Keep the pos...
It' s not too bad.
- One more time?
Go.
I can' t believe it' s tonight.
We' il change in the car.
Mrs. Schumacher.
Hey, Mrs. Schumacher, wait, we' il help you.
Such junk.
That' s where I went.
George Burns was a teacher.
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
So I' il just keep my shoulders down, my head up...... my frame locked, stay on my toes...
What if I forget the steps?
And remember, let him lead you.
I' m afraid I' m gonna forget to spike, get dizzy and fall on my face.
No.
I don' t look at my feet, keep my head up, my eyes open...... tension in my arm, my frame locked, seat pulled up...
Thanks, Baby.
Look, I just want you to know that I don' t sleep around...... whatever Robbie might have told you.
And I thought that he loved me.
I thought it was something special.
Anyway, I just wanted you to know that.
So, how does it look?
I' m scared.
I' m so scared, Baby.
Don' t worry.
You' il be fine.
You' il be fine.
'Bingo!
That' s right.
- Hey, how about a dance later?
Who knows?
Lisa, you just gotta do something for me.
I don' t just gotta do anything.
Just tell Mommy and Daddy I' ve got a terrible headache and I' m in bed and check on me once, okay?
Bye.
'The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present'
'Johnny Castle and partner in "Mambo Magic."'
Relax.
Cross- body lead.
Wrong way!
Over here.
Ready for the lift?
Come on.
Keep goin '.
What a show.
Here are The Drifters. '
You did good.
I saw that old couple from Kellerman' s and I thought that was it.
Me too.
You know, but... by the second turn you really had it.
- But I didn' t do the lift.
- You did real good.
Johnny!
It' s Penny.
- You didn' t call an ambulance?
She made me promise.
He didn' t use no ether, nothing.
I thought you said he was a real MD?
The guy had a dirty knife and a folding table.
And I swear to God, Johnny, I tried to get in, I tried.
Johnny' s here.
What?
What is it, Baby?
- No.
Excuse me.
Everybody clear out, please.
We' re gonna take care of that.
- Who' s responsible for this girl?
- I am.
Please, is she...
Doc, thanks a lot.
Mr. Houseman, I don' t know how to thank you, to tell you..., to...
Was that what my money paid for?
I never meant to lie to you.
I' m not sure who you are.
But I don' t want you to have anything to do with those people again.
You' re to have nothing to do with any of them ever again!
I won' t tell your mother about this.
Right now I' m going to bed.
And take that stuff off your face before your mother sees you!
Is everything all right, Jake?
Go back to sleep.
Can I come in?
You probably got a great room.
This... it' s a great room!
No, leave it on.
I' m sorry about the way my father treated you.
Your father was great.
The... way he took care of Penny.
Yes, but I mean the way he was with you.
It' s really me it has to do with.
Johnny, I came here because my father...
I mean, I could never do anything like that.
That was something.
I mean, the reason people treat me like I' m nothing is because I' m nothing.
That' s not true!
You... you' re everything!
You don' t understand the way it is...... I mean, for somebody like me.
This month, women are stuffing diamonds in my pockets.
I' m balancing on shit, as quick as that I can be down there again.
No, it' s not the way it is!
It doesn' t have to be that way!
You look at thew world and you think you can make it better.
Somebody' s lost, you find 'em.
Somebody' s bleeding and...
That' s really brave, like you said.
That took a lot o 'guts to go to him!
I mean... you' re not scared of anything.
I' m scared of everything!
I' m scared of what I saw.
And most of all I' m scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life...... the way I feel when I' m with you!
Dance with me.
What, here?
Here.
'Singers, dancers, actors, this is your lucky day!'
'beginning in the playhouse.'
- So, everyone gonna be in the show?
Miss the weekend traffic.
But Jake, we' re paid up till Sunday.
Daddy, and miss the show?
I said we' re leaving tomorrow.
But Daddy, I was going to sing in the show.
People bring their own arrangements.
Oh Baby, I need you for props.
Jake, why would you wanna leave early?
It was just an idea.
We can stay if you want to.
So, Lisa, what were you planning to sing?
Or "I Feel Pretty."
What do you think, Daddy?
You look much better.
You just missed your father.
He' s such a wonderful man.
I didn' t realize...
Oh, you couldn' t have.
It' s okay.
- So, how you doin '?
Yeah?
I can still have children.
Oh, Penny, that' s great, that' s really great.
- So, how did it go last night?
Fine.
I didn' t do the lift, but it was good.
I guess I' m gonna go.
Bye.
See you.
- Johnny, what are you doing?
Don' t worry about Max, I' il tell him your grandmother died or something.
How many times have you told me never get mixed- up with them?
I know what I' m doing, Penny.
You listen to me.
You' ve got to stop it now.
I got a lesson with the Kramers.
You gotta go.
See you.
Pin the tail on the guest. '
'Win ten boxes of Kleenex or a billy goat!'
I' m so sick of this rain!
Remind me not to take my honeymoon at Niagara Falls.
So, you go to Acapulco.
It' il be fine.
Where is my beige iridescent lipstick?
I know I put it in this drawer.
Baby, where are you going in this weather?
Uh, they' re having charades in the west lobby.
Oh, quite the little joiner, aren' t we?
Have you had many women?
- Have you had many women?
Baby, come on.
I wanna know.
- No!
Look... you gotta understand what it' s like, Baby.
And these women...... they are throwing themselves at you and they smell so good.
And they really take care of themselves.
I' d never known women could be like that, you know.
And they' re so rich, they' re so goddamn rich you think they must know about everything.
- different women.
And... oh why, you think "Hey..." "... they wouldn' t be doing this if they didn' t care about me, right?"
You were just using them, that' s all.
No.
No, that' s not it.
It wasn' t like that.
They were using me.
What' s your real name, Baby?
Frances.
For the first woman in the Cabinet.
That' s a...... that' s a real grownup name.
I' ve decided to go all the way with Robbie.
Oh Lisa, no, not with someone like him.
Do you think if we came back here for a tenth anniversary, it would be free?
It should be with someone...... it should be with someone that...... that you sort of love.
You don' t care about me.
You wouldn' t care if I humped the entire army...... as long as I were on the right side of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
What you care about is that you' re not Daddy' s girl anymore.
He listens when I talk now.
You hate that.
My frame.
Where' s my pleasing arc?
Spaghetti arms!
Would you give me some tension, please?
You' re invading my dance space.
This is my dance space.
Let' s cha- cha.
Don' t look down.
Look right here.
- "Sylvia" - "Yes, Micky?"
- "How you call your lover boy?"
- "Come here, lover boy."
- "And if he doesn' t answer?"
- "Oh, lover boy."
- "I simply say"
"Baby Oh, baby"
"My sweet baby"
"You' re the one"
Baby, takin 'dance lessons?
I could teach ya, kid.
I wanna talk to you about the last dance.
- Yeah?
I' ve got a lot o 'ideas.
- Like those...
It' s a way over your head here.
I thought, you always do the mambo, huh?
Now, why not dance this year' s final dance...... to the pachanga?
Right.
- Sure, Neil.
Great idea.
Sometimes he' s hard to talk to, but the ladies seem to like him.
See that he gives you the full half- hour you' re paying him for, kid.
That little wimp.
He wouldn' t know a new idea if it hit him in the pachanga.
I could have told him some new ideas.
Oh, why did you let him talk to you that way?
What do you mean, and fight the boss man?
Yeah, tell him your ideas.
- He' s a person like everyone else and...
- Look, I know these people, Baby.
They won' t listen to me.
Well, then why not fight harder?
Because I need this goddamned job lined up for next summer.
My dad calls me today.
He says:
Oh, what union?
The House Painters and Plasterers, local number 179, at your service.
I don' t think they saw us.
Fight harder, huh?
I don' t see you runnin 'of to Daddy tellin' him I' m your guy.
- I will tell him.
- I don' t believe you, Baby.
I don' t think...... that you ever had any intention o 'tellin' him.
Ever.
'Well, cousins, it' s almost over.
'And soon it' s back to the old books and back to work.
What a terrible thought! '
Hi, have you seen Johnny?
I' m sorry.
Hey, well, it looks like I picked the wrong sister.
I went slummin 'too.
Hit me.
Get outa here.
You' re not worth it.
You' re not worth it.
Hi, Vivian.
Win big, Moe.
- As always.
I' ve got something worked out for us.
Oh yeah, thanks.
Hey, kid.
Why don' t you...... give my wife some extra dance lessons?
I' m sorry, Mr. Pressman, but...... I' m booked up for the whole weekend, you know, with the show and everything, so I won' t have time for anything else.
I don' t think it' d be fair to take the money.
I' ve decided tonight' s the night with Robbie.
He doesn' t even know yet.
Oh hey, Lisa...
It' s me.
Holy shit!
You wanna hear somethin 'crazy?
"Come on," and he put his arm around me...... just like he did with Robbie.
You know how you feel when you see a patient and...... you think he' s all right, then you look at the X- rays and this is nothing like you thought?
What happened, Max?
It' s exactly what it' s like when you find out one of your staff' s a thief.
Moe Pressman' s wallet was stolen when he was playing pinochle last night.
It was in his jacket hanging on the back of his chair.
He had it at 1: 30 and when he checked again at quarter of four...... it was missing.
So we ask him:
"You have an alibi for last night?"
He says he was alone in his room reading.
Yeah, there are no books in Johnny' s room!
There' s been a mistake.
There' ve been similar thefts at the Sheldrake and it' s happened here before.
Stay out of it, Baby.
Wait.
Come on.
Daddy, I need your help.
I know.
Oh?
I can' t tell you.
But just please trust me, Daddy.
I can' t.
- This Danish is pure protein.
- Mr. Kellermanm, look.
Maybe Johnny didn' t do it.
Maybe it was, uh...
You know, it could' ve been that little old couple, the Schumachers.
- I saw her with a couple of wallets.
- Sylvia and Sidney?
Baby, you don' t go around accusing innocent people.
I even saw them at the Sheldrake.
I got an eyewitness and the kid has no alibi.
You' il learn what it' s like to fire an employee.
No, Mr. Kellerman, wait a minute.
I know Johnny didn' t take the wallet.
I know he didn' t take it, because he was in his room all night.
And the reason I know...... is because I was with him.
I told you I was telling the truth, Daddy.
I' m sorry I lied to you.
But you lied too.
But you meant everyone who was like you.
But you meant by becoming a lawyer or an economist and marrying someone from Harvard.
But I' m in this family too and you can' t keep giving me the silent treatment.
And I love you.
I' m so sorry, Daddy.
But you let me down too.
I have been lookin 'for you all over.
They found the Schumachers.
They found out they were wanted in Arizona and Florida and they made a fortune here this summer.
So then... then it' s all right.
I knew it' d work out.
- I knew they' d have to apologize...
They fired you anyway because of me.
And if I leave quietly, I' il get my summer bonus.
So I did it for nothing.
No, no, not for nothing, Baby!
Nobody has ever done anything like that for me before.
You can' t win no matter what you do.
You listen to me.
I don' t wanna hear that from you.
You can!
I used to think so.
Dr. Houseman, can I, uh...
Look, I' m going anyway and...
- I know what you must be thinking...
Anything at all.
I know you want Baby to be like you.
The kind of person that does things to make other people look up to them.
Dr. Houseman, Baby is like that!
Don' t you tell me what to see.
I see someone in front of me who...... got his partner in trouble and sent her off to some butcher, while he moved on to an innocent young girl like my daughter.
Yeah, I guess that' s what you would see.
I can' t imagine me being here without you even one day.
Well, I just think, you have more time for... horseshoes and croquet.
Maybe they' il... saw you in seven pieces now.
I guess we surprised everybody.
I guess we did.
Hardly would be sorry.
Neither will l.
I' il see ya.
I' il do your hair.
It could look pretty if...
No.
This way.
"Singing all as one"
"Talent, play and fun"
"Soon the autumn starts"
"Softly in our hearts"
"Voices, hearts and hands"
"As the mountain stands"
"Whether rain or shine"
"Happily combine"
Good luck in medical school, son.
And I wanted to thank you for your help with the Penny situation.
I guess we' ve all gotten into messes like this.
What?
I thought Baby told you.
Look, I' m not sure.
They' re liable to pin it on any guy around.
What' s the hot tip for the day?
Finished.
We' ve seen it all, eh?
Bubba and Zeda serving the first pasteurized milk to the boarders.
Through the Depression when we didn' t have anything.
Lots of changes.
It' s that it all seems to be ending.
You think kids wanna come with their parents and take fox- trot lessons?
Trips to Europe, that' s what the kids want.
Twenty- two countries in three days.
It feels like it' s all slipping away.
"Where no cares are seen"
"So let' s join in just one last chorus"
"Visitors, staff and guest"
"Old friends are the best"
Nobody puts Baby in a corner.
Come on.
Sorry about the disruption, folks...... but I always do the last dance of the season.
This year somebody told me not to.
So I' m gonna do my kind of dancin 'with a great partner...... who' s not only a terrific dancer...... but somebody who' s taught me...... that there are people willing to stand up for other people, no matter what it costs' em.
Somebody... who' s taught me...... about the kind of person I wanna be.
Miss Frances Houseman.
Sit down, Jake.
I think she gets this from me.
Do you have sheet music on this stuff?
I know you weren' t the one who got Penny in trouble.
When I' m wrong, I say I' m wrong.
You looked wonderful out there.

Well...... I slipped...... on a thermal transfer this morning.
It' s never happened before.
I wasn' t concentrating enough.
Yes, I understand.
Things haven' t been...
-... going well.
- Yes, fine.
How could I be so wrong?
My mate...... has been acting very strange.
I can' t explain it.
- Yes.
- I haven' t been feeling very well myself.
- Yes, I understand.
- I don' t know, maybe it' s me.
Yes, fine.
I needed some pinural last night.
- I feel as if something...
- Excellent.... odd were happening to me.
- Something that...
- Yes? -... I can' t understand.
- Could you be more...... specific?
The sedatives.
I' m taking etracene, but it doesn' t seem strong enough.
I have a hard time concentrating.
You are a true believer.
Blessings of the state.
- Please, forgive me.
- Blessings of the masses.
Thou art a subject of the divine, created in the image of man...... by the masses, for the masses.
Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.
Work hard.
Increase production.

If it will make you happy, just this once.
Now, be careful, it 's heavy.

Is that you?
We are sorry, but we must deny your request.
Birthborns are not allowed more than 5 units of enerval.

I took it for a test drive and ran straight through a crowd at the dispersal center.
Terrible.
No, it was wonderful.
Because I didn 't hit anyone, just an 1 1 14.
Why did you change it?
- You' ve seen enough.
- Well, that' s wonderful.
- No, it' s terrible.
- You know I don' t feel well.
- Take your sedation.
- That is terrible, just terrible.
No, it was wonderful, wonderful.
Because my hand, it was paralyzed anyway.
That was very funny.
Remember, an enerval overdose may cause a serious chemical imbalance.
My time is yours.
Go ahead.
What 's wrong with me?
What am I to her or she to me?
Nothing.
- Yes, fine.

I share rooms with her.

We share nothing...... but space.

Yes, I understand.

I' il never make it the way I am now.
I wouldn' t turn you in, not now.
- You don' t -- - I know I wouldn' t.
You can do it without etracene.
I know you can.
- Then what?
It can' t go on forever, you know it can' t.
We could leave.
And live in the superstructure.
You only have one more shift left, don' t you?
We could be gone before the next series started.
It' s all right.
- It' s all right.
- Standing by.
What' s this?
I have to see SEN.
I' ve just been given a shift change.
- When?
- Now.
- Now?
- He wants me to come to his quarters.
A shift change should come through scheduling.
Why should he want to see you?
I don' t know.
- Don' t go.
- I have to.
He' s a G34.
You don' t have to.
I don' t trust him.
You ought to file a report.
No.
Don' t make trouble.
It' s nothing.
Then why did you bring it up?
I didn' t.
You asked me about the card.
You' re going to get us into trouble.
It' s more work for the cleaning detail.
- Did you copy that?
- The android, the hung- over writing.
Is he copying me?
This is borough- flow submaster.

I was just thinking about you.
I must apologize for all this chaos.
They moved in this morning...... and it' s been going on all day.
The roommate was destroyed, you know.
Terrible inconvenience.
Have to try to see things in perspective, do what you can...... to make things...... fit.
I can accept things up to a point.
But if you get a chance...... to make...... adjustments...... you' re very foolish to pass them up.

You' re in violation.
Don' t say that.
What have you done to LUH?
She was here.
We...... had a long talk.
And she agreed that it would be better for both of you to switch.
She seemed to think that you weren' t accurately mated with her in the first place.
I' il never have another mate like ONA.
You rate very high in sanitation.
I' ve checked.
I don' t feel well.
We' il be happy.
Combined with the economic advantages of the mating structure...... it far surpasses any disadvantages in increased perversions.

I can program myself for any area, almost.
I' il report you.
Listen, no need to be distressed with me.
- Get out of here, leave me alone.
- I' ve taken care of LUH.
I programmed her to area 5450.

A very difficult balance, you know?
Listen.
Now, let' s get something straight right from the start.
It' s gonna take you some time to see my overall plan.
So until then, stay out of things you don' t understand, right?
You' re gonna be making things more difficult for me.
It' s the least you can do.
What' s wrong with you?
- Don' t be like that.
- It' s all right.
You' re safe now.
When posterity judges our actions here...... it will perhaps see us not as unwilling prisoners...... but as men who, for whatever reason...... preferred to remain as non- contributing individuals on the edge of society.

- My friend, your point of view....
Yes, CAM, that' s it.
Your point is well taken, CAM...... but it lacks the balance that a broader and deeper range of experience can lend it.
When I first arrived here, I saw things as perhaps you do now.
Yes, I was confused about my predicament.
I longed to thrash out, to tear down, to destroy and annihilate...... to ravage, wreak havoc and plunder.
Being basically levelheaded, however...... I realized that my first goal should be to study this place...... where what seemed blind circumstance had placed me.
Listen to the mumblings of an old man...... and bank those flames with earnest inquiry and honest observation.
"Mumblings."
"Mumblings," you hear?
Know how many times we' ve listened to that speech?
Do you know how many times we' ve had to listen to that speech?
Know what you are?
You make me sick.
If we thought like you --
You know what I want?
I want ideas.
I want one idea.
One idea could get us out of here!
We' il just have to be sure it' s the right idea.
We' il find it.
I' il know it when I see it!
Clear and straightforward and plain as the nose on your face.
Talked to oneself over....
-- believed he was going to a place where he' d be happy.
And in so believing, he created a veritable paradise for himself right here.
Unfortunately, not all of us can have the positive conviction of LOO.
But, thankfully, not all of us are burdened with the ominous forebodings of SEN.
I, myself --
Now, that' s what I mean by the wrong idea.
Look, I' m not going to try to prove the usefulness of history.
It is genuinely too obvious to need proof.
I want to help you.
You can help me.
Here.
Take a biscuit.
You understand, we' re all in this together.
You want to leave.
You' re not like them.
I' il see to it that we all get out of here.
Take it easy!
Look at them.
It' s pathetic.
It' s pitiful.
They' ve even begun to go into my corner and look for things.
My things.
You' re with me.
I know.
I have a contract.
All it says is:
"You' re with me."
We' re all in this together.
We must convince the others.
Later, then.
We need a new unity.
And not a unity which discourages dissent.
We need dissent, but we need a creative dissent.
Our voices are not raised in any harmonious chorus...... but our differences are differences of emphasis rather than of fundamentals.
- Tomorrow, as we -- - Nondescript 6431 399.
- What is it?
- A shell dweller.
They live in the outer shell.
Quite unique.
There have been two here before, and they smell.
What do you know?
Come here, my friend.
Let me touch you.
What' d he just do?
What' s wrong, huh?
Your lunch is dirty.
What a waste.
Here, we can save some of it.
It' s all right.
Everything' s fine.
What?
Well, if you didn' t want it, why' d you take it?
I thought this was all settled.
- Where you going?
- I' m leaving.
Leaving?
Leaving what?
You can' t leave.
You can' t go.
Hey, wait.
Oh, I know, the smell.
Yeah, it' s terrible.
It' s a little bit....
Hey, you can' t -- You can' t leave without....
Just a minute.
Just wait there a minute.
After long deliberation, I have decided to go out...... and personally examine the barrier...... to learn firsthand what difficulties are involved...... and decide how to overcome them.
I recognize an element of risk...... but moments such as these require that a choice be made and action taken...... regardless of the danger.
We' il be back soon...... but we' il be gone long enough to form an accurate and functional escape.
And I shall have an honest idea how best to organize us into a working unit.
- The new alignment.
- lncredible.
Hey, wait for me.
Just the thing to put them on their feet.
Show them who the leaders are.
When we get back, they' il be right there, right in the palm of my hand.
There' s no question.
Even old PTO would be with us...... if he' d still been advised.
How far before they can' t see us anymore, huh?
Maybe we better sit down right here.
Hey, rest for a while.
I can' t....
I can' t see them anymore.
LUH.
You' re going after LUH, aren' t you?
Why, it' s ridiculous.
Going after....
Oh, wait, I knew there was something I had to tell you.
LUH, you know, the other --?
The new LUH?
He told me he' d seen her.
He saw her just before he came out here.
- She' s gonna be coming out here.
- How was she?
Oh, very well.
Just exactly the way --
- You' re lying.
- No, I am not.
The air' s getting thinner.
Or pressure' s getting greater.
It' s the pressure.
How do you feel?
Shouldn' t be this far.
There' s no air.
I haven' t got the time.
You can stay here if you like.
I' il come with you.
What?
Look.
What?
That' s a man.
It' s a man.
He' s waving to us.
Hi.
Hi.
Hello.
Where' d you guys come from?
Oh, well, it doesn' t make any difference.
I' m starving.
Do you mind?
How did you get here?
I mean, I was lost.
You' re not lost now?
Know the way out?
- That' s the way out.
- That' s the way we came.
Yeah, but maybe you were traveling in circles.
That' s the way out.
How do you know?
Well, look.
You see?
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
Nothing stopped us.
Come on.
Here' s a doorway.

- Hello, 1 2.
- Synapse module, this is security B.
Read me, synapse module?
Research into relay system must be given --
-- intercerebral process reported earlier.
How shall the new environment be programmed?
It all happened so slowly that...... most men failed to realize that anything had happened at all.
I wonder what happened to SEN.
We' il never make it through that main way.
- Who are you?
- I' m a hologram.
I' m not real.
You know, the fantasy bureau...... electrically- generated realities and all that.
I was stuck in the same circuit for too long.
The arm and leg routine, did you see that one?
I always wanted to be part of the real world.
So I left.
Hey, look.
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.
This --
We have a U65 on a K8.

This is an electronic- restricted area.
It would be nice to have three additional officers.
- No.
They must be somewhere in group 9.
Operation 5271.
Budget Control, we' d like a cost analysis on the THX 1 1 38 account.
Include all interest and inflation percentages.
Expenditures are 649 and rising.
- What was that?
- Must be an expressway.
This is Budget Control.
The expenditure ceiling on the THX case is 14, 000 credits.
Remember, thrifty thinkers are always under budget.
Would you like part of this?
It' s not very much.
Did you know all the insides are gone from all these people?
Halt.
Economics make it necessary to terminate any operation...... which exceeds 5 percent of its primary budget.
Expenditures are 1 000 and rising.
Things don 't seem to make sense.
Sometimes I see things get left out...... and they don 't fit.
People don' t seem to see them.
Or they don' t know what to do.
Sometimes l --
A little adjustment...... can make all the difference.
I wanna do the right thing.
I wanna go back.
I....
I....
I can -- I can start again.
I can change.
I can -- I can help.
I just need a....
Need to rest up for a little while.
This is no place for prayer.
If you want to speak to OMM, you must go to a unichapel, you know that.
- Yeah.
- What?
- No.
I' m okay.
I' m going now.
What' s your number and your prefix?
I' m gonna see this gets into your report.
No, I' m leaving now.
I' m sorry, I have to report all intruders.
- Where' s your identification badge?
- I lost it.
You' re in violation.
I' il have to report you to the authorities.
- No, it' s not my time.
- Please, just --
Trapped.
Trapped.
Looks like the only way out is the way we came in.
Say, do you have any more of that food?
I' m hungry.
She' s not there.
Who are you looking for?
Can you hear me?
Stay calm.
Everything will be all right.
The door seems to be jammed.
Please check the lock on your side.
Everything will be all right.
We are here to help you.
Stay calm.
We are not going to harm you.
Everything will be all right.
Well, unless that computer has made a mistake...... that 's your roommate.
No, you 're wrong.
I hope that auxiliary load holds.
I' m almost through to the upper positive plates.
Upper positive plates?
Maybe there' s something wrong with the computer.
It' s a strange life.
Cybernetics, genetics, lasers and all those things.
I guess I' il never understand any of that stuff.
Guess maybe holograms are not supposed to.
THX 1 138 will be taken into custody at a minimal monetary expenditure.

He appears to be heading outside the city.
Repeat, he is heading outside the city.
All I can do is note your information.
Stand by.
Please come back.

You have nowhere to go.
You cannot survive outside the city shell.
We only want to help you.
This is your last chance.
- Good sleep?
- Not bad.
So where are we?
Where you from?
San Diego.
Left yesterday.
So you came Honolulu- Guam- Pago- here?
Long trip.
What do you do?
l’ m a psychologist.
Hey, a shrink.
They’ ve called in everything else.
How do you mean?
We’ ve ferried people out of Guam for the last 2 days.
Physicists, biologists, mathematicians, you name it.
Everybody being flown to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.
What’ s going on?
They’ re not telling us anything, sir.
What did they tell you?
There was a plane crash.
Do you get called in on crashes?
l’ m on a list of psychologists the FAA brings in when a plane goes down.
So where exactly are we now?
That’ s where we’ re headed.
Over there.
Here.
Take a look.
What is that?
All that for a plane crash?
I never mentioned a plane crash.
- Any other gear?
Watch your step.
- l’ d like to call my family.
We’ il get you settled in quarters first.
Remain there till we send for you.
- l’ d like to get started.
- We’ il send for you.
- lt’ s critical I see them -- - Who?
The survivors. lf I don’ t get to them in the first 24 hours --
- What survivors?
- The survivors of the plane crash.
Plane crash?
I deal in post- traumatic stress and survival guilt.
Maybe I should talk to someone who knows what’ s going on here.
- Talk to the ship’ s psychiatrist.
- l’ m a psychologist.
That’ s why I was sent here.
I told you people I need a phone.
Discuss that with Mr. Barnes.
That’ s fine.
Give me a phone, l’ il call him.
Why are you here?
Take your hands off me, please.
Do you have any idea who I am?
Tell him the name of the book you wrote.
Astrophysics You Can Use.
It was a Book- of- the- Month Club Main Selection.
Never heard of it.
You really thought he read your book.
You haven’ t changed.
It was written for the layman.
He’ s not impressed.
ls there a phone in here?
- l’ ve been trying to call my wife.
- Would you stop touching me?
Wait a minute.
Beth?
All units make your flight quarters...... condition one stations for landing.
Stay clear of the fantail --
Goodman, you been here long?
- l’ ve been here 3 hours.
- Welcome aboard.
This thing scares the hell out of me.
lt’ s already too late.
You might as well helicopter me back...... because the damage is done to the survivors already.
We’ il get to that.
- I don’ t even know who you are.
I know who you are.
Navy?
What are you?
You ever hear of the OSSA?
They don’ t know who I am.
That should reassure you.
You haven’ t talked to anyone about this?
- I talked to the helicopter pilot.
- What’ d you tell him?
I told him I was here to see the plane crash.
That’ s my job.
Plane crash.
Good.
There was no plane crash.
Spacecraft.
A spacecraft.
I guess that explains a lot.
- NASA?
- That doesn’ t surprise you?
At least it explains the secrecy.
The secrecy’ s critical, Norman.
You made that explicit in your report.
What report?
ULF.
I wrote that for the Bush administration.
And that’ s our bible here.
But that was a report about a possible encounter with an alien being.
You want to come with me?
Oh, boy.
About 3 weeks ago...... a ship laying fiber- optic cable between Honolulu and Sydney...... hit an obstruction 1, 000 feet underwater.
Cut this cable here clean as a shears.
The Navy got interested, sent out a search ship.
It turned out that what did it...... was this.
We took this with side- looking sonar.
This is an aerodynamic fin longer than a football field...... bigger than any known wingspan.
This is the fuselage.
This is ultrahigh- res SLS bottom scan.
Came in a week ago.
There it is, buried under about 8 yards of coral.
Something’ s wrong with that measurement.
Pacific coral grows an inch a year.
You can set your watch by it.
That’ s right.
1709.
So you’ re saying this spacecraft crashed 300 years ago?
288.
That’ s impossible.
lt’ s not impossible if this spacecraft came from an alien civilization.
Wait a minute.
You think this is an alien spacecraft?
lt’ s ridiculous.
We think there’ s an Unknown Life Form on the spacecraft.
That’ s why you’ re here.
You are the contact team that was recommended in the Goodman Report.
We have a biochemist...... to assess the physiology of the Unknown Life Form.
A mathematician, because that’ il probably be our common language.
And we have an astrophysicist to locate its place in the cosmos.
- Led by a psychologist.
- Right.
Nowadays, the little green men say, ’ ’ Take me to your therapist ’ ’?
Listen up.
’ ’ Contact teams meeting an Unknown Life Form or ULF...... must be prepared for severe psychological impact.
Stress reaction of confronting such life has not been sufficiently studied...... and cannot be entirely predicted in advance.
But the most likely consequence of contact is...... absolute terror. ’ ’
That’ s from Norman’ s report.
l’ m sorry, are these parameters correct?
You’ re saying that you have a spacecraft over a half a mile long...... that crashed into the ocean 300 years ago and it’ s completely intact?
That’ s right.
And the kicker is, our sonar is picking up a low- level hum.
Something’ s still running inside.
There’ s no way this coral could’ ve grown faster than an inch a year?
That’ s what we’ re going there to see.
Who says?
Harry, that’ s a joke, right?
This is the greatest scientific discovery since Copernicus.
Bigger!
The idea that we’ re not alone, it’ il change everything.
Evidence of extraterrestrial life.
You don’ t want to see that?
I got to say that I resent this briefing very much.
And how’ s that?
lf Norman’ s report calls for a biologist, a mathematician...... an astrophysicist and a psychologist...... why are you here?
Physical protocols start in a half an hour.
You always wear glasses?
I just started wearing these.
Are the glasses a problem?
I don’ t actually need them.
They’ re just for reading.
And they’ re more of a crutch.
I see fine without them.
But they didn’ t anticipate l’ d be going 1, 000 feet under the water.
Do you take prescription medication?
No.
None at all?
Once in a while sometimes I might take like a...... a piece of Xanax or something if l’ m nervous.
Something like that.
But not...... much.
Knee surgery.
Complete reconstruction of ACL, right knee.
Still have steel pin here, steel pin here, little medial collateral damage.
I see that you have a scar on your neck.
Car accident.
- Were you drinking?
- Yeah.
But I wasn’ t driving.
Wait, I just want to apologize for putting your name on the list.
Why?
When I made the report a few years ago, I picked names of people I knew.
And?
I know Ted because of his father.
- Yeah, so what?
- Beth was a patient.
lt’ s a bogus report.
What?
Did you tell Barnes?
You can’ t do that.
That’ s fraud.
They came to me, new administration, right?
Political agenda.
They said, in case of an alien invasion, do’ s and don’ ts.
Why didn’ t you just say no?
$35, 000.
It paid the down payment on my house.
New administration wanted to prove they’ re doing something new.
How’ d you come up with this team...... of a biologist, an astrophysicist and a mathematician?
Right.
- How?
- I don’ t know.
It sounded good, right?
Made them come to me.
I forgive you, Norman.
I forgive you!
But I don’ t forgive you for Ted.
He’ s a pain in the ass.
l’ il talk to him.
You don’ t have to be around him.
He idolizes you anyways, but l’ il talk to him. l’ il buy you dinner.
- l’ m sorry.
Come on.
Like a dream.
Have you called your wife?
Why not?
This’ il be a saturation dive.
You’ il be going to a habitat in 1, 000 feet of water.
A sub will take you to the Habitat and you’ il transfer aboard.
At 1, 000 feet, your body will be pressurized for that depth.
You could actually take a quick dip.
The pressure wouldn’ t bother you.
Although I wouldn’ t recommend it because the water’ s so cold...... you’ d freeze to death in less than 2 minutes.
That’ s the reason for the diving suits.
Your helmet has a rebreather for your air supply.
Following this briefing, l’ il take you to an onboard dive tank.
For the next 8 hours...... you’ il train in deep- saturation dive techniques and emergency procedures.
Once you’ ve gone down 1, 000 feet...... if you surface, you’ il have to commit to several days of decompression.
There is no real quick return.
However, there is a mini- sub...... that may be used as an emergency escape vehicle.
But there must be a ship at the surface to mate to for decompression.
Without decompression, your body would literally burst.
Under these circumstances, you’ re very well- controlled.
The dive has been planned well and professionally monitored.
The descent will take about 13 minutes, descending at 80 feet a minute.
lt’ s going to get chilly.
Try to relax.
Next time, just tell us when you’ re going to push the button.
Mozart...... Horn Concerto in E- flat...... K- 447.
How you holding up, Captain Nautical?
- l’ m loose.
- You’ re loose?
l’ m loose. l’ m loose.
l’ m uptight.
- We okay?
- We’ re in the river now.
What river?
lt’ s a temperature/ salinity differential.
It flows like a river inside the ocean.
- Under the ocean and there’ s a river.
- That’ s right.
You okay?
Right now, l’ m not okay.
Would you please not touch me?
Yes?
Would you cut that out, please?
That’ s Harry’ s stress reaction.
Those noises we’ re hearing, that’ s normal?
Those noises are the water pressure attacking the sub’ s integrity.
You know a little something about that, don’ t you, Norman?
How the pressure can attack your integrity.
Come on, you be nice this trip.
Were you nice last time?
You two want to sit together?
My God!
Norman, look at this, look at this.
That’ s just the fin.
That’ s the Habitat.
The Navy moved it in sections and set it up as a base...... as soon as the spaceship was discovered.
It' s manned by 2 naval personnel.
It will be your home- away- from- home while we investigate the spacecraft.
It ain’ t the Motel 6.
Approaching docking bay from R- 4.
All personnel, descent sub one engaging lock area.
You are now depressurized.
We’ re going to pressurize you now.
That’ s the helium.
- Helium?
- Was I the only one paying attention?
Oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same family as fluorine and chlorine...... hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid.
That’ s why we’ re breathing helium.
Because oxygen at any level higher than 2. 3 becomes toxic.
Can you run that by me again, Ted?
I don’ t speak balloon.
What?
That’ s my voice.
The helium resonates differently with my vocal chords. ’ ’ Follow the yellow brick road. ’ ’
Kiddies, cut it out.
Put them on.
The Navy dive team is setting up a hydraulic robot...... in the air lock outside the spacecraft.
We’ il use that to open its door.
ls that the door?
Yeah, we used sonar imaging to pinpoint it before the divers went down.
- How tall is that robot?
- Five feet.
And it’ s roughly the same size as an airplane door, isn’ t it?
- Excuse me, Ted.
- I think that’ s worth taking note of.
Excuse me.
Tell them our team is in place and ready, okay?
This is Habitat to Navy dive.
Has it occurred to anyone maybe we shouldn’ t open that door?
Why do you say that?
We assume they’ il be green...... or insect- like, but basically human.
But what if they inhale air and exhale cyanide gas? lt’ s plausible.
Or live forever, like a virus or a yeast.
But why would you assume that a ULF would want to kill us?
An immortal creature wouldn’ t think killing was right or wrong.
lt’ d have no concept of it.
lnstant eradication. lt’ s what all the serious scientific stuff talks about.
What little there is on the subject.
You did put that in your report?
lt’ s in there.
Get us the ETD for team’ s departure to surface.
Tell them we’ re in ready and thank them.
Habitat to Navy Dive.
Our team’ s ready to take over.
Descent sub ready for your return to surface.
Thanks for all your help.
We’ il let you know what we find.
l’ m not too thrilled at the prospect of this.
What if you have to go to the bathroom?
Just go down your leg, Ted.
Really?
You can urinate in these?
You can.
The question is, do you want to?
Where’ s the switch?
Okay, let’ s go.
All right, Fletcher...... we’ re at 1, 022 feet.
The ambient temperature, 34 degrees.
Heading out north- northwest...... 330.
lt’ s a firm bottom.
lntermittent coral.
This is great, you guys.
Look at the size of that thing!
My God!
You see that tunnel?
That’ s where we’ re going.
lnto the heart of darkness.
We’ re in the coral pipe now, Fletcher, approaching the air lock.
ls that normal?
Just use your equalizer.
A little better.
The most toxic creatures on Earth live down here.
The venom of the land animal is nothing by comparison.
Even the weakest sea snake is invariably lethal.
ls that supposed to make me feel good, Beth?
This is our air lock.
lt’ il take us from a wet to a dry environment.
We’ re assuming the inside of the ship is sealed.
This thing is enormous.
That' s not budging, is it?
- Turn it at 45 degrees.
- What’ s happening here?
Is that piston broken?
Can you get the suction cup flat to the plane of the door?
Maybe it’ s the hydraulics.
The pressure messes everything up at this depth.
Time for a demonstration in basic physics, gentlemen.
What is it, Harry?
Take a look.
lt’ s chipped.
So what?
l thought you said this thing wasn’ t damaged when it crashed...... that this titanium alloy was so super- strong, you can’ t hurt it.
I did.
So why does it chip when this scientist just bangs it with a hammer?
ls there heat coming off this thing?
Get out of there.
Back up.
Just a minute.
Get back.
Jesus.
Anybody else wonder who the hell opened that door?
How did that happen?
l’ m not sure about the atmosphere.
Helmets stay on.
All right.
We come in peace.
Always wanted to say that.
Fletcher, inform the Navy we’ ve gained access...... to the spacecraft.
There' s a hell of a lot of radiation shielding in here.
Huge grids of catwalks and plumbing...
... and a lot of steam.
lt’ s endless.
We’ il stay in touch here.
Somebody’ s been here.
There’ s footsteps and they ain’ t ours.
So what do you say, Norman?
Time to turn back?
l’ m a little curious.
Break up into 2 squads.
We’ il never cover the territory otherwise.
Split up?
He’ s got a point.
We’ ve only got about a half- hour of breathing time left.
Ted and Harry, you come with me.
Come on.
I think the people who built this place would call that ’ ’ divide and conquer. ’ ’
Whoever built this thing wanted us dead, we’ d be dead already.
These guys offer a federal grant to study the effects of an alien invasion.
I told all this to Harry.
You made up the report?
No, not all of it.
I mean, I did research on half of it.
Who did the other half?
I borrowed from, you know, good writers.
lsaac Asimov, Rod Serling....
Rod Serling?
You know?
I show up here, half the Pacific fleet is here.
I just didn’ t know what to do.
I wanted to tell you, that’ s all.
ls this in the same category as, ’ ’ Beth, I thought you knew I was married ’ ’?
I don’ t think we have enough oxygen --
- Oh, my God.
- Did you push something?
It did it on its own.
That must be the cockpit.
Hold on.
Cross- stress bracing on the outer hulls.
All axes supported.
Look at this stuff.
This is interesting.
Soft and strong at the same time.
lt’ s, like, better than rubber, better than steel.
You know a lot about this stuff.
I studied aeronautical engineering at M. l. T.
lsn’ t that where you got your Ph. D.?
lt’ s where I got mine.
All 3 of them.
I hated M. l. T.
Envy?
Puberty.
How old?
First Ph. D., 18.
Damn.
One year, Harry.
You beat me by one year.
Let’ s push on.
Let’ s go.
Man, they didn’ t tell you how heavy these things were out of the water.
Look at this.
Come here.
"Basura."
Trash?
Oh, God.
Jesus!
lt’ s human.
You mean humanoid.
No, Norman, I mean human.
Blunt force trauma.
You can see by the direction that the fracture runs...... that he was hit in the back of the head.
What’ s in his hand?
I don’ t know.
What is it?
’ ’ Smokehouse Almonds ’ ’?
My God, it’ s an American spaceship.
It can’ t be an American spaceship.
There weren’ t even Americans, let alone spaceships.
It can’ t be, but it is.
I mean....
Look at this. lt’ s in English.
Come here.
Okay, good.
Right there.
And there.
Look at the dates!
Can’ t be.
Could be.
It could be 2043 or 1643.
I don’ t know which one is weirder.
’ ’ Unknown Entry Event. ’ ’ Press it.
You sure?
This is Barnes, Norman.
Yeah, I can hear you.
I can’ t explain it, but I think we’ re inside an American spaceship.
It gets better.
What the hell is it?
Whatever it is, it seems to be what this bird was designed to do.
Go out into space and gather things like this up and bring it back.
Yeah, but back from where?
Don’ t get too excited, Ted.
Turn this thing over, it’ il probably say ’ ’ Made in Korea. ’ ’
Somehow I doubt that.
No doors.
No hinges of any kind.
l’ il bet if you put a laser micrometer on this, it’ d be a perfect sphere.
Perfect to a thousandth of an inch.
That’ s a message in and of itself.
- Really?
- What do you mean?
When Pope Benedict asked Giotto to prove his worth as an artist...... Giotto drew a perfect circle...... freehand.
lt’ s a powerful message.
- What’ s that?
’ ’ This ball wants to be caught. ’ ’
Nobody built this thing looking into their third eye.
They went to a lot of trouble and they didn’ t do it for nothing.
Something put this thing out there to get picked up and brought back here.
Have you forgotten the Trojan horse?
It could be a trap.
Don’ t you think that’ s a little paranoid?
No, l’ m going to put a video camera on this thing and keep an eye on it.
Can I ask you something about this reflective surface?
Yeah, it appears to be mercury, doesn’ t it?
Except mercury’ s liquid at this temperature.
That’ s not what l’ m talking about.
What worries me is that it’ s reflecting everything but us.
I hate to be the one non- scientist that picks this up, guys.
You know what I mean?
What do you think it is?
I don’ t know.
Whatever it is...
... it’ s alien.
Okay, an American spacecraft, materials, technology...... more advanced than what we know, crashes into the ocean.
Why wasn’ t it damaged?
The materials are obviously super- strong.
lf that’ s true, why did it chip when you hit it?
Better:
It didn’ t crash.
It arrived...... 300 years ago.
- From where?
- Not ’ ’ where. ’ ’ When.
So you’ re saying this thing took a wrong turn?
That’ s right.
I mean, what if the craft...... inadvertently flew into a black hole?
It arrived in our past from its present.
The dates in the flight record -- 43, 47.
That has to be 2043, 2047.
The image you saw, what you described...... sounds like a black hole, a tear in the space --
We know what a black hole is.
I don’ t know.
lt’ s a collapsed star with so much gravity it’ s like a vacuum cleaner...... sucking everything into it, light, interstellar dust, time --
- Time?
- lt’ s possible, but not plausible.
lt’ s more than probable.
lt’ s rudimentary astrophysics.
We just haven’ t been able to fly into one and prove it.
I just got off the horn topside.
They’ re expecting a bad blow up there.
And they’ re pulling us out.
Pulling us out?
What do you mean?
What part of ’ ’ pull out ’ ’ don’ t you understand?
Extraction.
We’ re leaving.
That’ s ridiculous.
We haven’ t even begun to scratch the surface here.
lf you’ ve ever seen a Pacific cyclone, what we call a tornado is a little fart.
So I suggest you go back to the dormitory and take a nap.
You need to lower your metabolism before we start the decompression.
You’ re leaving a time- traveling spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?
l’ m just following my orders.
But, no aliens.
- It was made in America.
- What’ s your point?
My point is, l’ m a biochemist and there’ s no life down here.
What is wrong with you?!
That doesn’ t mean there’ s nothing to learn, to explore!
She’ s right.
You guys are the human contact team for an Unknown Life Form.
There is no Unknown Life Form, so we pull out at 0900.
- Please say something to him.
- What?
I don’ t know.
Do you not have an opinion about this?
l’ m delighted we’ re going back up top.
You know what I mean?
This may look like a roadside diner, but in the meantime...... my ears won’ t pop and if I pull this thing away from my neck...... l sound like someone’ s squeezing my testicles.
Let’ s go home.
Barnes is wrong, you know.
You mean, wrong about the storm?
No, about the Sphere.
What about the Sphere?
lt’ s alive.
Why do you say that?
There’ s something inside it.
How can there be anything inside it?
There’ s no door, no seams.
The Sphere chooses what it will and won’ t reflect.
Doesn’ t that seem like the actions of a conscious being to you?
I think, for whatever it’ s worth, you’ re angry...... towards our friend Ted in there...... because he figured this out before you did.
You really think so?
I don’ t know.
This is my first underwater session.
You’ re right.
Ted did figure it out first, didn’ t he?
Good shrinkage.
We’ re all going to die down here, you know.
What?
What?
You see, it’ s curious.
Ted did figure it out.
Time travel.
And when we get back, we’ re going to tell everyone...... how it’ s possible, how it’ s done, what the dangers are.
But why 50 years in the future, when the spacecraft encounters a black hole...... does the computer call it an ’ ’ Unknown Entry Event ’ ’?
Why don’ t they know?
lf they don’ t know...... it means we never told anyone.
And if we never told anyone...... it means we never made it back.
Hence...... we die down here.
Just as a matter of deductive logic, Norman.
Damn, I wish I could get inside that Sphere.
- What’ s wrong?
- Talk to Mr. Barnes.
- Where is he?
- Video feed room.
I don’ t know where the hell anything is.
Where am l?
Where?
What’ s going on?
You tell me.
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don’ t know.
Do you know what he’ s doing?
- I need to know what you know.
- Nothing.
He wanted to go inside.
We are inside.
You mean outside?
- He said, ’ ’ inside. ’ ’ - What? lnside the spacecraft?
I think inside the Sphere.
Holy shit!
My God.
Did he go inside?
- I don’ t think so.
- What the hell’ s going on?
He didn’ t just disappear.
I think it’ s a glitch in the video.
Give me playback on that.
You’ il have it in a minute.
You knew he was doing this and you said nothing.
- You didn’ t think!
- I didn’ t think it possible.
Where are Beth and Ted?
I woke up, I heard bells ringing and I started running --
I' m not getting an image on the sub.
Impossible!
I got a cable in my quarters!
They’ il be here in 25 minutes or less!
The only logical explanation is that the sub is still at the surface.
ls it also logically possible your sonar is messed up?!
Let’ s just calm down, all right?
He didn’ t just disappear.
We are not going to leave him.
I am not going to lose a civilian on my watch.
You have just screwed up our trip to the surface.
We are not going up to the surface.
Harry!
We are not going up!
Harry!
Can you hear me?
Harry, can you hear me?
Norman, this is not a triage situation.
Go find me Ted and Beth.
Norman, stop.
Still no reading on the sub.
Forget the goddamn sonar, Teeny.
All right?
What the hell?
Can you hear me?
ls he alive?
We have a problem.
His pulse is normal.
All his vitals are normal...... but I don’ t get it.
Hello!
Norman, can you hear me?
We lost video here.
Can you hear me?
- That tears it.
- What, sir?
We’ re on internal power.
I don 't follow you.
They cut us loose, Teeny.
For some reason the sub turned back.
Break out your 5- day deodorant pads.
We' re here for the duration.
Everything’ s normal.
What’ s going on?
ls he all right?
ls it true?
Did he go inside?
What did he say?
He didn’ t say.
He’ s aphasic.
He’ s asleep, Ted.
He didn’ t say anything?
There’ s no door, no entry.
How did he get in?
Can I have your attention, please?
We' ve lost contact with the surface.
The Habitat is now operating solely under internal power.
We have plenty of food, oxygen and fresh water...... to sustain us until the storm is over...... and we reestablish contact with the surface.
But until that time, this mission is subject...... to emergency authority under my command.
l’ m taking this out to the mini- sub.
- Are you up on the duty roster?
- Yes, sir.
Where’ s she going?
lt’ s procedures.
Everything in the Habitat is videoed.
Every 1 2 hours we take the videos to the mini- sub and press the reset button.
The idea is, if something happens to us and we don’ t reset it...... the sub goes to the surface automatically.
lf we’ re all dead, they at least have a partial record of what went wrong.
Cheerful thought, huh?
Mind the store a minute.
l’ m going to the head.
What the hell’ s that?
lt’ s so beautiful down here.
lt’ s so tranquil.
This is beautiful.
lt’ s hard to believe we have a typhoon 1, 000 feet above our heads.
Hey, it' s snowing down here.
You see them?
There' s got to be a million...... jellyfish down here.
Man, this is really beautiful.
These jellyfish are getting a little friendly.
Having a hard time seeing.
Hey, guys, you getting this?
It' s getting thick down here.
Hello, hello.
I can 't see what I' m doing.
They’ re sticking to my faceplate.
Fletcher, this is Dr. Fielding.
Just swim through them.
They’ re harmless.
Guys, these jellyfish are everywhere.
Fletcher, get out of there.
What are jellyfish doing at 1, 000 feet?
I think they feel the heat from my body.
I can’ t get them off me!
They’ re stinging through my suit!
Get back to the Habitat on the double.
I can’ t move my legs!
Come back to the Habitat.
They’ re inside my suit!
Just keep moving!
Help me!
Jesus, Barnes, she' s dead!
There' s no bubbles.
Edmunds.
Yes, sir?
Come on down here.
Something...... happened to Fletcher.
God!
When I was 5 years old I went out on a boat with my father.
He told me not to jump in the water, so of course I did and....
Oh, my!
I jumped right into a school of these guys.
Not this big, though.
l think every one had a shot at me.
l’ ve been...
... afraid of them since.
Would you feel any better if I told you this wasn’ t exactly a jellyfish?
You mean...?
I mean, jellyfish like this are unheard of.
I don’ t know what this is, but it isn’ t God’ s creation.
Here I am Your special island
Bali Ha 'i
You can come in.
Have a seat.
You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- How well do you know Dr. Halperin?
I used to teach at UC San Diego years ago.
She came for her master’ s.
Don’ t take it personally, but I assume she wasn’ t a romantic interest.
Don’ t take what personally?
She’ s a tall, vibrant, younger woman.
What’ s your point?
You knew her as a patient.
l’ m not at liberty to discuss that.
You understand.
I understand an exotic- gas environment 1, 000 feet under water...... with no lifeline to the surface...... is about the most dangerous environment on the planet.
lf there’ s a problem, I got to know about it.
- Beth is fine. - ’ ’ Beth is fine. ’ ’
- Beth’ s fine.
- She’ s very fine.
Would you like to read this and tell me what it says?
- Are these my actual notes?
- What does it say?
- How in the world did you get -- - Does it say ’ ’ suicide attempt ’ ’? ’ ’ Electroshock therapy ’ ’?
lsn’ t that what it says?
What’ s your point?
Didn’ t it seem important enough to tell somebody?
You were willing to jeopardize these people’ s lives...... to have someone here who could be mentally unstable?
Are you aware of the term, ’ ’ overreact ’ ’?
We’ re 160 fathoms down.
And we’ ve got a nutbag down here who can flip out and crack up.
You selected the team.
Why didn’ t you tell me?
When I wrote this, I didn’ t know the team would be 1, 000 -- 1, 000 or 10, it makes no difference!
Why didn’ t you tell me about Beth?
It wasn’ t pertinent.
That was not your call to make!
Yes, it was and it still is.
It was a passive attempt.
A passive attempt?!
Those who really want to kill themselves shoot themselves or go over a bridge.
They don’ t call their boyfriend and say, ’ ’ I just took 20 Nebutol.
Help me. ’ ’
She took 20 yellows, and you’ re telling me she’ s perfect.
What is it?
Come in.
He’ s awake?
He’ s really awake.
Man, oh, man!
You’ re going to have a problem with me.
lf my good buddy Norman keeps cooking like this, I ain’ t going nowhere.
This toast is good.
Bacon?
Better.
But these eggs!
These eggs are fantastic!
Norman, what did you put in these eggs?
No, no, wait.
Don’ t tell me.
Tarragon and....
What is that?
ls that chervil?
Yes, it is.
l’ m glad you like it, Harry.
I love eggs!
They sure seem to cheer you up.
Do you remember what happened?
I went inside.
How did you get inside?
There are no doors.
There are doors all over this place and we can’ t get out.
- We’ re still here.
- Yes, we are.
You didn’ t answer my question.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Harry, are you saying we shouldn’ t still be here?
Where’ s Teeny?
I thought she did all the cooking.
She had an unfortunate accident, Harry.
She was killed.
Killed?
How?
Jellyfish.
Jellyfish?
That’ s strange.
Yes, it is strange, isn’ t it?
Here you go, Harry.
Look at that.
- lt’ s not onion rings.
Good, though.
Guess what it is.
Calamari!
You all right?
Cough, cough, cough.
- No, you’ re doing it wrong.
- I know what l’ m doing.
Bring it up.
Come on, bring it up.
He’ s trying to say something.
He’ s trying to talk.
You don’ t listen.
He wants to say something!
- l’ m not choking, you asshole!
- See?
I hate squid.
I hate squid.
l’ m sorry.
I was trying to help.
You okay?
Harry, let me ask you something.
Before you went in the Sphere, you were convinced we would die here.
Yeah, I remember that.
You still believe it?
You afraid of dying, Norman?
Bullshit!
He’ s hiding something and you know it.
He went inside the Sphere and whatever it is he saw, he won’ t tell us.
- He said he doesn’ t remember anything.
- You bought that?
The whole food thing was all a diversion.
The guy’ s willing to put all of our lives on the line...... because he doesn’ t want to share information.
He’ s making notes for a book.
He wants to win the Nobel Prize.
And you don’ t?
Norman, you’ ve known me since I was 17 years old.
I would love to be the guy who gets --
Do you know how respected --
l’ m not! l’ ve written one ’ ’ Fun With Dick and Jane ’ ’ book on physics.
I mean, Niels Bohr...... he published ’ ’ The Quantum Theory of Atomic Structure ’ ’ at 28.
Einstein, relativity, 26.
Newton, gravity, 23.
ln physics, if you haven’ t done it by 35, chances are you never will.
This doesn’ t have anything to do with your competitiveness with Harry?
19.
Wunderkind!
I rest my case.
Mr. Barnes would like to see you.
Something’ s wrong with the computer system.
- I tried.
It just keeps coming back.
Discharge from the buffer memory?
I ruled that out.
The helium is getting to the chips.
lt’ s probably a saturation effect.
- lf that’ s true, what are our options?
- You have to change all the chips.
Run this place on manual?
lt’ s going to be a long 4 days.
Hey, boss.
- Figured that out yet?
- lt’ s a saturation effect.
I don’ t think so. lf it’ s a saturation effect, it would be random.
What do you mean?
This has a pattern.
See? lt’ s like a code.
A code from where?
How’ d you do that?
How’ d you see that?
Try binary.
See?
Letter breaks.
You think this is coming from the Sphere?
Don’ t know.
This mission is ultra top- secret.
What you translate is for my eyes only.
lf you were it, how would you know our alphabet?
Same way it’ s configured on a keyboard.
But reflected in an orb, spherically.
A keyboard, but spherical.
Take a keyboard...... wrap it around a sphere...... then starting at the center key, G, number the letters...... spiraling out.
- You the man!
- I still got it.
I still got the juice.
Keyboard.
They let you keep those?
Here, you want them?
All we got to do now is plug in the numbers.
Friends...... in the 8, 000 years of recorded history, this is a first.
You’ re now on- line with an alien intelligence.
You got to be kidding.
You must’ ve messed up the translation.
I don’ t think so.
lf this is right, this alien sounds like an idiot.
That’ s something to consider.
They must have them.
I will admit the message is childlike, but actually it’ s quite perfect.
lt’ s short, to the point, non- threatening...... kind of the way you talk to a small child or a dog.
Look at this.
He’ s making a speech.
Ask him for his last name.
What?
I want a full name for my report.
l’ m not putting in my report I lost a crew member on a deepsat expedition...... to find an alien named Jerry.
Please! ’ ’ Jerry ’ ’?
We ought to tell him that we’ re enjoying it too.
Ask him where he’ s from.
Where are you from?
You make a journey.
We make a journey together. ’ ’
I think Jerry’ s channeling Deepak Chopra.
A journey from where?
He’ s happy.
He’ s crafty.
What happened?
Damn, I think we lost him.
We’ re not alone.
We are definitely...... not alone.
lt’ s trying to make contact with us.
Now it’ s out, free to act.
What do you mean by that?
Free to take over our computers...... call us on the phone, come knock on the door if it wants to.
A physical presence.
What are you thinking about?
That last part where he said, ’ ’ I am happy. ’ ’
Don’ t you want Jerry to be happy?
Honestly?
What’ s on your mind?
I would be happy if Jerry had no emotions whatsoever.
Because the thing of it is, here’ s Jerry...... an emotional being, cooped up for 300 years with no one to talk to...... none of the socialization, the emotional growth...... that comes from contact with other emotional beings....
So?
What happens if Jerry gets mad?
What is that sound?
Did you hear it?
You hear that thump?
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
Did you hear that thump?
You are a hell of a woman.
I wish I knew you in the old days.
Norman told me you were --
Norman told you what?
Let’ s put it this way, that if Jerry could read your mind...... he’ d be bored with ours.
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
This is Norman.
I get no answer from Edmunds and there’ s strange noises.
Something’ s going on.
It looks like Edmunds is up on the side of the Habitat.
I' m not getting anything on sonar, but watch yourselves out there.
Would you hit your callback buttons, please?
What’ d you tell Barnes?
About what?
About me.
You told him I took 20 Nebutol and tried to kill myself.
Didn’ t you?
He had my notes.
What do you want me to do?
Did you tell him who I called?
Oh, God.
Come in.
Did you guys find that thumping yet?
